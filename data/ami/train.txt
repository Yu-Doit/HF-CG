'kay
okay
gosh
'kay
does anyone want to see uh steve's feedback from the specification
is there much more in it than he d
i i dry read it the last time
right
is there much more in it than he said yesterday
not really um just what he's talking about like duplication of effort and
mm
hmm
hmm
like duplication of effort and stuff and um yeah
he was saying that we should maybe uh think about having a prototype for week six which is next week
next week
yeah
so we should probably prioritize our packages
yeah now i'd say if for the prototype if we just like wherever possible p chunk in the stuff that we have um pre annotated and stuff
and for the stuff that we don't have pre annotated write like a stupid baseline
mm
then we should probably be able to basically that means we focus on on the interface first sort of
so that we we take the the ready made parts and just see how we get them work together in the interface the way we want and and then we have a working prototype
and then we can go back and replace pieces either by our own components or by more sophisticated compo po components of our own
so it's probably feasible
yeah
the thing is i'm away this weekend
yeah
so that's for me
yeah i mean if we just want to have um some data for the user face could even be random data
oh yeah um yeah
yeah
no
but also i might like the the similarity thing like my just my matrix itself for my stuff
uh mm mm
i c i i think i can do that fairly quickly because i have the algorithms
yeah i'm
yeah i think today's meeting is really the one where we where we sort of settle down the data structure and as soon as we have that
yeah
uh probably like after today's meeting we then actually need to
well go back first of all and look at nite x. m. l. to see in how far that that which we want is compatible with that which nite x. m. l. offers us
and then just sort of everyone make sure everyone understand the interface
yeah
so i think if today we decide on what data we wanna have now and and later maybe even today
we go and look at nite x. m. l. or some of us look at nite x. m. l. in a bit more detail
just trying to make some sense of that code and see how does the representation work in their system
and then sort of with that knowledge we should be able to then say okay that type of nite x. m. l. data we wanna load into it
and this is how everyone can access it and then we should be able to go from there
hmm
has has anyone actually looked at the java code for the huh
no
no
hmm
i've looked looked at the documentation and n like seen enough to make me think that we want to use the nite x. m. l. framework because um they have a good a event model that synchronizes sort of the data and and every display element
so that takes a lot of work away from us
sort of that would be a reason for staying within their framework and using their general classes
but beyond that i haven't looked at it at all which is something we should really do
yeah i think so
who actually like for this whole discussion i mean who of us is doing stuff that is happening on line and who of us is doing stuff that's happening off line
like my data is coming c
hmm
the basic word importance is off line as well
yeah
the combined measure might not be if we want to wait what the user has typed in into the search
okay
okay
uh mine's gonna be mostly using the off line
but the actual stuff it's doing will be on line
but it won't be very um processor intensive or memory intensive i don't think
'kay
so basically apart from the display module the i the display itself
we don't have an extremely high degree of interaction between sort of our modules that create the stuff and and the interface
so the interface is mainly while it's running just working on data that's just loaded from a file i guess
there isn't
yeah i i don't know about the search functionality that might be online
hmm
depends how it's gonna work
yeah i know
th yeah the search is i guess the search is sort of a strange beast anyway because for the search we're leaving the nite x. m. l. framework
yeah
um but that's still sort of that's good
that means that at least like we don't have the type of situation where somebody has to do like a billion calculations on on data on line
'cause that would make it a lot more like that would mean that our interface for the data would have to be a lot more careful about how it performs and and everything
and nobody is modifying that data at at on line time at all it seems
nobody's making any changes to the actual data on line
don't think so
so that's actually making it a lot easier
that basically means our browser really is a viewer mostly
yeah
which isn't doing much with the data except for sort of selecting a piece piece of it and and displaying it
are we still gonna go for dumping it into a database
hmm
are we still gonna dump it into a database
well some parts relevant for the search yes
i'd say so
'cause if we are i reckon we should all read our classes out of the database
it'll be so much easier
hmm
well if we're gonna dump the part of it into a database anyway
we might as well dump all the fields we want into the database calculate everything from there
then we don't even have to worry that much about the underlying x. m. l. representation
we can just query it
yeah but nobody of us is doing much of searching from the data in the on line stage
and for all together like the display itself
i think we are easier if we if it's sitting on the x. m. l. than if it's sitting on the s. q. l. stuff because if it's sitting on the x. m. l.
we have the the nite x. m. l. framework with all its functionality for synchronizing through all the different levels whenever there's a change whenever something's moving forward and stuff
and we can just more or less look at their code like how their player moves forward
and how that moving forward is represented in different windows and stuff
so i think in the actual browser itself i don't wanna sit on the s. q. l. if we can sit on the x. m. l. because sitting on the x. m. l. we have all we have so much help
and for y for like the p the calculations that we're doing apart from the search it seems that everyone needs some special representations anyway
well if we're gonna do that we should try and store everything in in an x. m. l. format as well
you mean our results
yeah
yeah in in the nite x. m. l. x. m. l. format so with their time stamps and stuff so that it's easy to to tie together st things
yes
yeah
what i'm like what we have to think about is if we go with this multi level idea
like this idea that sort of if you start with a whole meeting series as one entity as one thing that you display as one whole sort of
that then the individual chunks of the individual meetings whereas and then you can click on a meeting
and then sort of the meeting is the whole thing and the chunks are the individual segments
that means sort of we have multiple levels of of representation which we probably
if we if we do it this way like we f we have to discuss that if we do it this way
then we should probably find some abstraction model
so that the interface in the sense like deals with it as if it's same so that the interface doesn't really have to worry whether it's a meeting in the whole meeting series or a segment within a meeting
you know what i mean
mm-hmm
hmm yes
and that's probably stuff that we have to sort of like process twice then
like for example that like the summary of a meeting within the whole meeting corpus or meeting series y is meeting series a good word for that
i don't really know what how to call it
you know what i mean like not not the whole corpus but every meeting that has to do with one topic
hmm
yeah that makes sense
um so in in the meeting se series so that a summary for a meeting within the meeting series are sort of
compiled off line by a summary module
and that is separate from a summary of a segment within a meeting
'cause i don't think we can
i'm not so sure
well we don't even need to do that 'cause if we got our information density calculated off line
so all we do is treat the whole lot as one massive document
i mean they'll it's not gonna be so big that we can't load in a information density for every utterance
and we can just summarise based on that
i i thought we would just have like um one big summary um with all the uh different importance levels um displayed on it
and depending on what our um zoom level is we just display a part of it
so are we doing that at all levels
are we um
and we would have one very big thing off line
and from that we would just select what we are displaying
and just have different like fine grainedness levels sort of
yes
so for example you would um give a high value to those um sequences you want to display in the meeting series summary
mm
'kay
so the only thing that yeah so the only thing that would happen basically if i double click let's say from the whole meeting series on a single meeting
and you just cut off
is that the zoom level changes
like the th the start and the end position changes and the zoom level changes
that was what i sh i thought yeah
i think you can do it on line
i i thought we couldn't do that
i thought
like i was under the impression that we couldn't do that because we couldn't load the data for all that
but i don't know i mean that
hmm
i don't think there's really much point in doing like that when it's just gonna feed off in the end the information density measure basically
and that's all calculated off line
so what you're really doing is sorting a list is the p computationally hard part of it
so i'm s not sure if i got it
i was
well like the ideas we're calculating are information density all off line first for every utterance in the whole corpus right
mm-hmm
mm-hmm
so what you do is you say if you're looking at a series of meetings you just say well our whole document comprises of all these stuck together
mm-hmm
and then all you have to do is sort them by j information density
mm-hmm
like maybe weighted with the search terms and then extract them
okay
so
i don't think it's too slow to do on line to be honest
okay
i wa i was just worried about the total memory complexity of it
but i i completely admit i mean i just sort of like th took that from some thing that jonathan once said about not loading everything
but maybe i was just wrong about it
how many utterances w
is that
but i think the m difference might be that we want just want to have um the words
and that's not so much what he meant with not possibly loading everything was that you m um load all the uh annotation stuff
yeah and i w yeah
yeah
yeah
all the sound files all
hmm
yeah
yeah
so what we have is we would have a word
like we would have words with some priority levels
and they would basically be because even the selection would would the summaries automatically feed from just how prioritized an individual word or how indiv uh prioritized an individual utterance is
or i are the summaries sort of refined from it and made by a machine to make sentences and stuff
or are they just sort of taking out the words with the highest priority and then the words of the second highest priority
well on the utterance level i was thinking
so the utterances with the highest like mean information density
and the u okay
are we doing it on th the whole thing on the utterance level
in
or are we doing it on word level like the information density calculation
well the trouble with doing it on the word level is if you want the audio to synch up
you've got no way of getting in and extracting just that word
i mean it's impossible
we i think we have start and end times for words actually but it's yeah
for every single word
yeah
but it m it might s but it might sound crazy in the player
oh okay
we should really maybe we can do that together at some point today that we check out how the player works
yeah
i don't think that will do it
but there's maybe some merit in altogether doing it on an utterance level in the end
we'll have to buffer it
um i r i i'm getting quite lost um at the moment because um w what's um our difference between the um se um uh the importance measure and the skimming
so
i mean do we do both or is it the same thing
well the skimming's gonna use the importance
yeah
okay
but like at first it's just gonna be i. d. f.
so but when when we talk about summaries you talk about this uh abo about skimming and not about
well mostly skimming yeah
well but also about the displays i mean the displays in the in the text body
in the in the latest draft that we had sort of we came up with the idea that it isn't displaying utterance for utterance
but it's also displaying uh a summarised version in you know like below the below the graph the part
yeah
maybe
yeah r
yeah right isn't that the skimming
hmm
isn't that the skimming
oh yeah f it's just like there there's like audio skimming and there's displayed skimming
yeah but it use the same data
yeah
yeah
ma maybe there's some merit of going altogether for utterance level and not even bother to calculate i mean if you have to do it internally
then you can do it
but maybe like not even store the importance levels for individual words and just sort of rank utterances as a whole
well the nice thing about that is it will automatically be in sentences
well more or less
hmm
yeah
so it will make more sense and if you get just extract words
'cause it it might be better skimming and less memory required at the same time
and i mean if you if you know how to do it for individual words then you can just in the worst case
if you can't find anything else just sort of make the mean of the words over the utterance
you know what i mean
i'm not quite so what it did you want to do it i you just wanted to assign
w it's it's
well what's the smallest chunk at the moment you're thinking of of assigning an importance measure to is it a word or is it an utterance
uh i thought about words
so we're thinking of like maybe just storing it on a per utterance level
because it's it's less stuff to store probably for dave in the in the audio playing
mm
and for in the display it's probably better if you have whole utterances than i don't know
like what it's like if you just take single words out of utterances
yeah
that probably doesn't make any sense at all whereas if you just uh show important utterances but the utterance as a whole it makes more sense
a
yeah
so it doesn't actually make a difference for your algorithm 'cause it just means that if you're working on a word level
then we just mean it over the utterance
and yeah i think we also thought about combining that measure with um the measures i get from um s uh hot spots and so on
mm okay
they are on
so that would also be on utterance level i think
oh so that's good anyway then yeah
i think
i see it
because that makes it a lot easier than to t put it on utterance level
but it'll need to be calculated at word level though because otherwise there won't be enough occurrences of the terms to make any meaningful sense
oh yeah
no but i mean like how how jasmine does it internally i don't know
but it's probably yeah you probably have to work on word levels for importance
yeah
but there should be ways of easily going from a word level to an utterance level
yeah i reckon you can just mean it over the sentence
okay
yeah but how about those words which don't carry any meaning at all the um and uhs and something like that
yeah prob
because if we if we average average over over a whole utterance all the words
i think we should filter them
hmm
and there are quite unimportant words in there but quite important words as well i think we should just disregard the the
maybe we should have like um a cut off
so it a w word only gets a value if it's above a certain threshold
so anything that has less than say nought point five importance gets assigned to zero
okay
alright
well we do a pre filtering of sort of the whole thing
yeah that's the other th
sort of like but that like the problem with that is it's easy to do in the text level
but that would mean it would still play the uh in your audio unless we sort of also store what pieces we cut out for the audio
yeah
yeah
i think before we can like answer that specific question how we c deal with that
it's probably good for us to look at what the audio player is capable of doing
i think we'll have to buffer the audio
but i don't think it will be very hard
yes
i think it would be like an hour or two's work
so what do you mean by buffering
like you think directly feeding
like just build an another f wave file essentially
yeah you just concatenate them together
but yeah but not but not stored on the hard disk and then loaded in but loaded in directly from memory
yeah i mean i bet there would be packages
in memory yeah
so just like unp there's bound to be like a media wave object or something like that
and just build one in memory
but it's probably a stream if it exists in java it would be probably some binary stream going in of some type
i don't know
i have no idea
okay yeah
but it must have like classes for dealing with files
and if it has classes for concatenating files you can do it in memory
okay
okay so i mean so that means that there's probably even if you go on an per utterance level
so
there's still some merit on within utterances cutting out stuff which clearly isn't relevant at all and that maybe also for the audio we'd have to do
so let's say we play the whole au phrase but then in addition to that we have some information that says minus that part of something
that's okay that we can do
well what i think i might try and build is basically a class that you just feed it a linked list of um different wave forms
and it will just string them all together with maybe i don't know tenth of a second silence in between each one or something like that
yeah maybe even i mean that's sort of that depends on how how advanced we get
if maybe if we realise that there's massive differences in in gain or in something
you can probably just make some simple simple normalization but that really depends on how much time we have and and how much is necessary
normalise it yeah
yeah if like i d i don't know anything about audio and i have never seen the player
so if you find that the player accepts some n input from memory and if it's easy to do then i guess that's that's fairly doable
so but that means in the general structure we're actually quite lucky
so we we have we load into memory for the whole series of meetings just the utterances and rankings for the utterances and some information probably that says
well the i guess that goes with the utterance who's speaking
oh yeah yeah we'll need that
yes sure
because then we can also do the display about who's speaking
we also really wanna be able to search by who's speaking as well
yeah
but i'm i'm still confused 'cause i thought like that's just what jonathan said we do c that we can't do like load a massive document of that size
it doesn't matter 'cause all the calculation's done off line
on the other hand
the other hand i mean it shouldn't be like should be like fifty mega byte in ram or something it shouldn't be massive should it
actually fifty hundred megabyte is quite big in ram
hmm
just thinking what's the simp so
we do get an error message with the project if we load everything into the project with all the data they load
so we know that doesn't work
so our hope is essentially that we load less into it
yes
yeah
what's this lazy loading thing somebody explain lazy loading to me
it just means it loads on demand
it only loads when it needs a particular type of file
like when it's being accessed
ah okay
so that is that only by type of file
like if if if the same thing is in different files would it then maybe like you know
if if utterances are split over three or ten or w hundred different files
is then a chance maybe that it doesn't try to load them all into memory at the same time but just
yeah i think that's the idea it just loads the particular ones it needs
so why does it fail then in the first place
then it shouldn't ever fail because then it should never
but if you were doing a search over the whole corpus you'd have to load them all
yeah but yeah but um it uh it it failed right when you load it right the nite x. m. l. kit so that's interesting
yes right
hmm
oops it does
so i define baseline and what it loads
for example it loads all the utterances and so on but it doesn't load um the discourse acts and for example not the and what's what else there
hmm
not the summaries
it only loads those on demand
let's check that out
um i'll p i'll probably ask jonathan about it
so alternatively if we realise we can't do the whole thing in one go
we can probably just process some sort of meta data you know what i mean like sort of sort of for the whole series
chunks representing the individual meetings or some
like something that represents the whole series in in a v in a structure very similar to the structure in which we represent individual um meetings
but with data sort of always combined from the whole series
so instead of having an single utterance that we display it would probably be like that would be representing a whole um topic a segment in a meeting
and sort of so that wi using the same data st
y you mean that you um basically split up th the big thing into um different summaries
for example that you have a very um top level um summary and a separate file for for each level
well in a sense
uh i'm i'm thinking of in a sense of like creating a virtual a virtual meeting out of the whole meeting series sort of
that's easy
you just like create a new x. m. l. document in memory
yeah sort of like off line create a virtual meeting which which basically treats the meeting series as if it was a meeting
and treats the individual meetings within the series as if they were segments and treats the individual segments within meetings as if they were um utterances
you know so we just sort of we shift it one level up
mm-hmm
and in that way we could probably use the same algorithm and just like make vir like one or two ifs that say okay
if you are on a whole document uh a whole series level and that was a double click
then don't just go into that um segment but load a new file or something like it but in general use the same algorithm
that would be an alternative if we can't actually load the whole thing and
mm
'cause also like even if we maybe this whole like maybe i'm worrying too much about the whole series in one thing display
because actually i mean probably users wouldn't view that one too often
i don't think it's really that much of a problem because if it's too big what we can do is just well all the off line stuff doesn't really matter
and all we can do is just process a bit at a time
like for summarisation say we wanted a hundred utterances in the summary just look at the meeting take the top one hundred utterances in each other meeting
if it scores higher than the ones already in the summary so far just replace them
and then you only have to process one meeting at a time
yeah but i'm i'm still worried
like for example for the display if you actually if you want a display uh like for the whole series
the information density levels based on and and the f and the only granularity you have is individual utterances
that means you have to through every single utterance in a series of seventy hours of meetings
okay so maybe we should build a b store a mean measure for the segments and meetings as well
yeah
yeah and if you make that structurally very similar to the the le like one level down
like the way how we uh store individual utterances and stuff
then maybe we can more or less use the same code and just make a few ifs and stuff
yeah so so but still so in in general we're having we're having utterances
and they have a score
and that's as much as we really need
and of cou and they also have a time a time information of course
and speaker
hmm
and a and a s and a speaker information yeah
speaker and um topic segmenting we'll need as well
yeah so an information which topic they're in yeah
yeah
and and probably separate to that an information about the different topics like that
yeah
so
so the skimming can work on that because the skimming just sort of sorts the utterances and puts as many in as it needs
well yeah and then it'll f preserve the order when it's displayed the
yeah
yeah
yeah it'll it'll play them in some order in which they were set because otherwise it's gonna be more entertaining
yeah
um
but that that's enough data for the skimming and the the searching so what the searching does is the searching leaves the whole framework
yeah i think so
goes to the s. q. l. database and gets like basically in the end gets just a time marker for where that is like that utterance that we are concerned with
and then we have to find i'm sure there's some way in in nite x. m. l. to just say set position to that time mark
and then it shifts the whole frame and it alerts every single element of the display and the display updates
hmm
yeah we do not want it in to develop a little tree display as well for multiple results
yeah yeah
yeah but that'd be quite easy to do
that we can ju yeah but so so if if somethi so yeah
so if in that tree display somebody clicks on something
you just need to find the time stamp
yeah and then you sort of feed the time stamp to and the nite x. m. l. central manager
and that central manager alerts everything that's there like alerts the skim like the the audio display
yeah
alerts the text display
alerts the visual display and says we have a new time frame and then they all sort of do their update routines with respect to the current level of zoom
so how much do they display and starting position at where the or maybe the mid position of it
i don't know like w if start where the thing was found or if that thing wa was found it's in the middle of the part that we display
that i don't know
but that we can decide about but a general sort of
it's the same thing if like whether you play and it moves forward or whether you jump to a position through search
it's essentially for all the window handling it's the same event
yeah
it's only that the event gets triggered by the search routine which sort of push that into nite x. m. l. and says please go there now
so we should basically make our own x. m. l. document in memory
that everyone's um
module changes that rather than the underlying data
and then have that x. m. l. uh nite x. m. l. document tied to the interface
why do we have to do it in memory
but that stuff's so
well you can make it in a file if you want
i mean like the information is coming from off line
so we probably we don't even have to change the utterance document
right because the whole way like the whole beauty of the nite x. m. l. is that it ties together lots of different files
so we can just create an additional x. m. l. file which for every utterance like the utterances have i. d. s i presume some references
mm-hmm
so we just we tie uh p just a very short x. m. l. file
yeah
yes
which it's the only information it has that has whatever a number for for the um weight
for the information density and we just tie that to the existing utterances and tie them to the existing speaker changes
but there is no i. d. for an utterance i think
it's just for individual words
so how do we do that then
n uh no no it's f for
we for utterances as well
no you're right
yeah
i think it's just for one
it's for
word
yeah i think i think those segments for each utterance are split up
so we have to
yeah
think so
well otherwise we probably have to go over it and like add some integer that we just increment from top to bottom sort of to every utterance as an as an i. d. some type
or un or try to understand how nite x. m. l. i. d. s work and maybe there's some special route we have to follow when we use these i. d. s
yeah i'm pretty sure it's already there
it's alm hmm
pretty sure that's already there
the the utterances are numbered
yeah the the girl said the utterances themselves are not numbered at the moment
um
uh i'm not quite sure i have only seen that the uh the individual words have got an i. d.
okay
okay
okay
yeah
so i guess that would be solvable if not
yeah
you always could have a look at the time stamps and then take the ones that uh belong together to form an utterance
mm-hmm
no i i think we would just take the segments that are already that were yeah there's um this segments file
sorry
yeah if they are already there's it's easy but it would be possible
okay
um you know the x. m. l. segments
okay
uh yeah
hmm
okay
is that a board marker pen actually
oh
that i don't know
oh
yeah i think so
that's just so like to make a list of all this stuff or we probably can somebody can do it on paper
all these fancy pens
so what so the stuff we have we have utterances and speakers and weights for utterances
so for for every utterance sort of like the utterance has a speaker and a weight which is coming from outside
or we just tie it to it
and there is segments which hmm
they are utterances aren't they
the segments are utterances aren't they
ye that's the impression i get yeah
oh so sorry um
yeah
yeah that's um
uh topic s topic segments i meant
like they are they are a super unit
alright okay
mm-hmm
so so the utterances are tied to topic segments
oh
and if the time stamps are on a word level then we b somehow have to extract time stamps for utterances where they start
there there are time stamps um for well
well that's easy
segments um and for th um segments is for example when when you look at the data what is displayed in one line
w what segments now
okay
hmm
what when when you look at it in the hmm
is the uh is that the same as utterances that is that the same as utterances that
ye
mm
well it's close enough isn't it
i think so
isn't
yeah uh
it may not be exact every time but it's a so sort of size we're looking for
um for ex um i i compared it with what i did for the pause um duration extraction
mm-hmm
mm-hmm
um and basically it's uh words that are uttered in a sequence without pauses
but sometimes um however there are um short pauses in it and they're indicated by square brackets pause or something in the data
what so that's oh
right
but that's one o one segment or is that two segments then
um someti uh but uh the annotators decided what was one segment and what wasn't
yeah
okay
okay
so but but generally utterances is that which we just called uh sorry segments is that which we just called utterances now
like it's it's the sa it's sort of like one person's contribution at a time sort of thingy dingy
i think so
yeah yeah
okay
okay so yeah so we have those and and then we have some f field somewhere else which has
topics
topics yeah
yeah and and a topic's basically they are just on the i. d. probably with a start time or something
and and the utterances referenced to those topics i guess
yeah i think that's the right one
so the topics don't contain any redundant thing of like showing the whole topic again
but they just sort of say a number and where they start and where they finish
and the utterances then say which topic they belong to
hmm
yeah but um i think for some annotations um an uttera ca utterance can have several um types
for example for the dialogue acts and so on
yeah
no
but i was thinking of the topic segmentation now and and f for that there would only be one
okay
yeah that should be for
hmm
right because it's sort of like it's just a time window
yeah
mm-hmm
should be yeah
yeah
so if this lazy loading works then this should definitely fit into i mean not memory then because it wouldn't all be in memory at the same time
so if we just have those sort of that information like a long list of all the utterances slash segments and like short or smaller lists which give weight to them
and even though probably if there's a lot of over head in having two different files we can probably merge the weights into it off line
you know what i mean
like if if there's a lot of bureaucracy involved with having two different trees and whether one ties to the other because the one has the weight for the other
yeah
then it's probably quicker to just
but why don't we just write it as a new x. m. l. file
can nite handle just loading arbitrary uh new like attributes and stuff
i mean i would have thought they'd make it able to
yeah
i thought that was the whole beauty that like you can just make a new x. m. l. file and sort of tie that to the other and and it tre
yeah
so why do we need to have two x. m. l. trees in memory at once
oh yeah
so no i didn't i didn't mean tree
no
no
i meant just like handling two different files internally
sort of c i was just thinking you know like if if the overhead for having the same amount of data coming from two d files instead of from one file is massive
then it would probably be for us easy to just like off line put the the weight into into the file that has the segments
uh yeah segments slash utterances already
but that we can figure out i mean if it's going horrendously wrong
the other thing is that would mean we'd be using their parser as well which means we wouldn't have to parse anything which be quite nice
yeah
'cause their parser is probably much faster than anything we've come up with anyway
yeah
yeah no
we'd we'd be completely using like the whole infrastructure and basically just i mean the main difference really between our project and theirs really is that we load a different part of the data
but otherwise we're doing it the same way that they are doing it
so we just we're sort of running different types of queries on it
we in a sense we i think we are running queries it's not just about um what we load and what we don't load
but we're l running queries in the sense that we dynamically select by by weights don't we
that we have to check how fast that is like to say give us all the ones that whether that works with their query language
whether that's too many results and whether we shou
mm
you know
if 'cause if it i let's say i mean if if their query language is strange and if it would return b ten million results and it can't handle it
then we can just write our individual components in the way that they know which what the threshold is
so they still get all the data and just they internally say oh no this is less than three and i'm not gonna display it or something
yeah i mean we can process it in chunks if it gets too big basically
hmm
we can just process it all in chunks if it gets too big to load it into memory
yeah
no
i'm just thinking for this whole thing of like a different level sort of cutting out different different pieces
hmm
whether we do that through a query where we say give us everything that's ab above this and this weight or whether we skip the same infrastructure
but every individual module like the player and the display say like they still get sort of all the different utterances
uh all the different pieces but they say oh this piece i leave out because it's below the current threshold level
i think we probably want to store sorry
i think we probably want to store um a hierarchical information density as well
so like an informan mation density score for each meeting and each topic segment
'cause otherwise we'd be recalculating the same thing over and over and over again
yeah that'd be much more efficient to do that
yeah
yeah
and that will obviously make it much easier to display
when do we need the one for the meet
well it may not for the whole meeting but like
okay
yeah i guess for the so when we have the display will we display the whole series
then if we have for the individual topic segments within the meetings if we have ready calculated disp um measures
then we don't have to sort of extract that data from the individual utterances
yeah exactly
yeah and that's also fairly easy to store along with our segments isn't it
yeah
for the segments
are we extracting some type of title for them that we craft with some fancy algorithm or manually or we're just taking the single most highly valued key word utterance for the segment heading
well we can start off
like that
well i was gonna start off i've v got sort of half way through implementing one that does just i. d. f.
hmm
and then just i can change that to work on whatever
hmm
it's probably like in in the end probably it wouldn't be the best thing if it's just the high most highly ranked phrase or key word because like for example for an introduction that would most definitely not be anything that has any title anywhere similar to introduction or something
yeah
hmm
and it should be weighted by stuff like the hot spots and um the key words in the search and stuff like that
yeah
also like for this part maybe if we go over it with named entity in the end
if i mean w if one of the people doing dil has some named entity code to spare
hmm
and just like at least for the for sort of for finding topics titles for for segments
just take a named entity which has a really high what's it called d. f. i. d. f. whatever
'cause you'd probably be quite likely if they're talking about a conference or a person
that that would be a named entity which is very highly fr um frequented in that part
did he not say something about named entities
so i thought he said there wasn't very many
yeah he said they're quite sparse
so that basically was don't bother basing too much of your general calculation on it
yeah
but like especially if they're sparse probably individual named entities which describe what a what a segment is about would probably be quite good
like if there's some name of some conference they would could probably say that name of the conference quite often
even though he's right that they make indirect references to it
anyway sorry
you s uh you said you are currently in uh implementing the idea
what exactly are you computing
yeah
it's not t. f. i. d. f. it's just inverse document frequency
okay
'cause it's really easy to do basically
okay
there's just like for a baseline really
mm-hmm
yeah you're able to do that in java yeah
well i'm half way through
it's not working yet but it will do
yeah
so you're doing that on a on a per word level
um yeah
okay
and then averaging it over the utterances
okay
but it's not like um related to the corpus at all
it's just working on an arbitrary text file at the moment
okay cool
i was just wondering where you had the corpus from at the moment
no
huh
so it it seems that the data structure isn't a big problem and that basically we don't have to have all these massive discussions of how we exactly interact with the data structure because most of our work isn't done with that data structure in memory in the browser
but it's just done off line and everyone can ha represent it anyway they want as long as they sort of store it in a useful x. m. l. representation in the end
so like
it would be useful to know how everyone's gonna store their things though
hmm
yeah that would mean understanding the nite x. m. l. x. m. l. sort of format in a lot more detail
yeah
we should i think we should just have a long session in the computer room together and like now that we know a bit more what we want
take a closer look at nite x. m. l.
yeah
well i've got like a few hours free
yeah i've had a b i've had a look at the the topic segments how it's stored
like after this
mm-hmm
and then yeah th those are few per meeting and it um well
it gives a time stamp and inside each one there's uh the actual like utterance segments
mm-hmm
and the list of them that occurred
and they're all numbered
um so that's where that's stored
good
yeah i haven't looked at this stuff much at all
yeah
so i guess um if i'm gonna be segmenting it with a l. c. seg then that's like same format i'd want to um put it back out in so it'd be equivalent
yeah
yeah
who's who's sort of doing the the the central coordination of of of the browser application now
like
well like the integration
hmm
what do you mean integration
yeah or but also like all these elements like like the loading and yeah integration and and like handling the data loading and stuff
hmm
i don't know
i don't think anyone's been allocated to do that yet
nah
i'm sort of like i think i'll take over the display just because i've started with a bit and found it found it doable
yeah yeah
yeah definitely
so somebody should sort of be the one person who's who understands most about what's t centrally going on with with the with the project
like with the with the browser as a whole and where the data comes in and
hmm yeah
any volunteers
it's the most boring task
mm-hmm
it's also a complicated one
yeah it c could be difficult yeah
yeah
yeah
i know but uh b i guess we can do it like several people together
it's probably just those people have to work together a lot and very closely and just make sure that they're always f understand what the other one is doing
yeah
well i guess the important thing is to get the crucial m modules built
or at least um simple versions of them
ye yeah
yeah or or ready made versions of them for that matter and
yeah and then
yeah and then we'll maybe have to prioritize somebody into just integrating it
yeah but i think actually like at the moment the integration comes first i mean it's sort of at the moment the building the browser comes first
and then only comes the creating new sophisticated data chunks
because that's sort of the whole thing about having a prototype system which is more or less working on on chunk data
but it at least we have the framework in which we can then test everything and and look at everything
'cause before we have that
it's gonna be very difficult for anyone to really see how much the work that they're doing is making sense because you just well i guess you can see something from the data that you have in your individual x. m. l. s files files that you create
but it would be nice to have some basic system which just displays some stuff
so maybe we should try doing something really simple like just displaying a whole meeting
and like just being able to scroll through it or something like that
or just adapt like their like just sort of go from their system and and adapt that piece for piece and see how we could
yeah
how we could arran like adapt it to our
system
does anyone want to like just sit with me and like play for three hours with nite x. m. l. at some point
are you free after this
uh i wouldn't like to be 'cause i'd like to go to the gym
i'm theoretically free
but if there's any time t hmm
how about friday then
'cause i'm off all friday
you have nothing no free time on wednesday
uh wednesday i've got a nine 'til twelve
hmm
nine 'til twelve and then nothi you have or you
yeah nothing in the afternoon
hmm
i've got nothing in the afternoon
so
anytime wednesday afternoon i'd be cool i think
okay
so you ha yeah
where about just in appleton tower
yo forrest hill whatever one's easier to discuss stuff i don't know
uh i'll be in um the appleton tower anyway
i'm not biased
okay
what time do you wanna do
um well i'll be there from twelve
i've got some other stuff that needs done on matlab so if you're not there at twelve i can just work on that
okay so i'll just meet you in in eighteen a in the afternoon
so
yeah
i guess at the moment nobody critically depends on like the nite x. m. l. stuff working right now right
like at the moment you can all do your stuff and i can do my l. s. a. stuff
mm-hmm
and i can even do the display to a vast degree without actually having their supplying framework working
so it's not that crucial
yeah i think so
yeah i w i w i would need the raw text pretty soon because i have to find out um how i have to put the segments into bins
yeah actually i need the raw text as well
and then yeah
yeah but i was i was i was more thinking of the sort of the the whole browser framework as a running programme now
uh yeah
no that's not necessary
yeah i think we all need the raw text in different in different flavours don't we
hmm
yeah yeah
why w
jasmine i thought you just said that you'd uh looked at extracting the text
yes i did
but um i've only just got the notes
i have to still have uh to order everything by the time and
yeah
so you you said you did it in python yeah
yeah i think it's quite easy after the
yeah did you use uh b the x. l. uh x. m. l. parser in python
yeah
yeah
right
yeah sounds pretty good
so uh
so um 'cause yeah
i was having a look in it a look at it as well and i noticed the um the speakers are all in that separate file
mm-hmm
so did did you have to combine them all and and then re order them
yeah b i uh w that's what i was uh thought
that you just combine them and then order the time stamps accordingly
yeah
ye yeah c
right
yeah so that's approach um well i was going to do
so yeah we may as well collaborate
okay
um what i found out was that there are quite a lot of things without without s time stamps in the beginning
in the word files
yeah and uh x. m. l. files
yes but that's
yeah that's just an i. d. or something
i don't know
yeah everything that's a word has a sti time stamp
just numbers
yes but what are the other things that's uh some kind of number
f maybe the file number or something that is in the beginning
what is that
i'm not sure i what you mean
do you know
um i think there are quite a lot of numbers in the beginning where n there is no time stamp for the numbers
it's
think they say um quite a lot of numbers and before that uh um there's this number
was it
but number within the x. m. l. context
yeah there i are numbers in the um the w. tag but there are no time stamps
are they spoken numbers
like do they look like they're utterances numbers
yeah
there's the number task isn't there
that's part of the whole thing
that's at the end
hmm
that's at the end i think her time
okay
yeah in the beginning as well sometimes i think
oh right
at least i saw some
yeah maybe
hmm
didn't have a look at our meetings
yeah we have to probably cut that out anyway for our project i don't know
yeah
it's probably gonna screw up a lot of our data otherwise
yeah
if not sure if it what it does to document it would probably make the yeah if if you have segments for that probably the
hmm
uh i i think it wouldn't as it occurs i mean it would be it occurs in every meeting
so
and i think it even has uh its own annotation like digits or something
so that should be really easy to cut out
okay
uh i'm just thinking like it pro it pro probably like the l. s. a. would perform quite well on it
it would probably find another number task quite easily seeing that it's a constrained vocabulary with a high co occurrence of the same nine words
yeah
i'm sure
so that wou ten word
but what it is it actually that numbers
hmm
ah it's just to test the system i think
yeah
okay so but there are no time stamps annotated to that
so
i think it's also something that they they said the numbers in order right
it's it's quite strange
mm they have to read numbers from
yeah i think it's it the it sounded like they wanted to check out how well they were doing with overlapping and stuff
because basically it's like they're reading them at different speeds but you know in which order they are said
uh i didn't have a look at that
anyway
so
icsi has some reasons for doing it
hmm
they must have been pissed off saying like numbers at the end of every meeting
and also um there are different um combinations of letters
b. r. e. and something like that
is it everything ordered are the time stamps global or uh are they local at any point
mm i thought they were local to th a particular meeting
they
okay
um dave if you would or actually for well if you're doing i. d. f. s or you whatever you call your your frequencies i always mix up the name
uh you need some dictionary for that at some point though
like you need to have some representation of a word as not not that specific occurrence of that word token but of of of a given word form
because you're making counts for word forms right
yeah
i'm just building a dictionary
yeah so we should work together on that because i need a dictionary as well
oh mine's just gonna use the um hash map one in um java
'cause i'm only gonna do it on small documents
okay
it's just like bef until the information density is up and running
'kay
just something to get give me something to work with
okay
didn't you say that the o the ord
so it's only gonna use quite small documents you see to start with
yeah but for i'm just wondering for the whole thing
does somebody wo who was it of you two who said that um there's some programme which spits out a dictionary probably with frequencies
yeah it's rainbow
it's um i think it's just the dictionary in the first place
but
okay
is anyone of you for the for the document frequency over total frequency you gonna have total frequencies of words then with that right
like over the whole corpus sort of
um no i have to bin it up and so i will only have counts for each each bin or something
or
why does it need to be classified into like different segments
it's because um rainbow is a text classification system
and i think it's not possible to have just one class
that's the problem
can we just fill a second class with junk that we don't care about
maybe we could
like i don't know copies of shakespeare or something
yeah sure you sure we could do that but i don't that makes sense
'cause if what we're looking for is the um frequency statistics i don't see how that would be changed by the classification
if we need just frequencies maybe we should just calculate them by using perl or something
i the
i don't know
well there maybe another tool available
yeah it's quite easy to just count and s or sort them by um frequency
yeah
w using which tool are you talking about
just using a perl script
be careful with that
like my experience with the british national corpus was that there's far more word types than you ever think because anything that's sort of unusual generally is a new word type
is it too big
yeah
like any typo or any strange thing where they put two words together
and also any number as a word type of its own
so you can easily end up with hundred thousands of words when you didn't expect them
hmm
so generally dictionaries can grow bigger then you think they do
i don't know how you how many terms you can handle in perl
well you can probably also you can probably pre filter like with regular expressions even just say if it consists of only dig digits then skip it
or even if it consists any special characters
mm yeah
then skip it because it's probably something with a dot in between which is usually not something you wanna have and
um i can't remember who's got it
might be wordnet
but one of these big corpuses has a list of stop words that you can download and they're just basically lists of really uninteresting boring words that we could filter out before we do that
it's like that's one the papers i read
that's um one things they did right at the beginning is they've got this big s stop list and they just ignore all of those throughout the experiment
what i did for my project i just ignored the hundred most frequent words because they actually end up all being articles and and everything and stuff
so we need like several of us need a dictionary
am i the only one who needs it with frequencies
yeah i it would be useful for me as well
am i the only one who needs it with frequencies
or
it uh i think that'd be useful for me as well
frequencies
yeah
yeah
well i guess as soon as we have the raw text
we can probably just start with the java hash map and like just hash map over it and see how far we get
yeah
i mean we can probably on a machine with a few hundred megabyte ram you can go quite far
you can write it on beefy
so even if it goes wrong and even if it has a million words be
well all you really wanna do is look into getting some sub set of the icsi corpus off the dice machines
'cause i hate working on dice
it's awful
like so i can use my home machine
oh yeah burning it on a like we should be able to burn the whole corpus just the x. hmm
ha has a c. d. burner though
has a c. d. burner
ah i see i asked support about that two days ago
in the informatics building there oh sorry in in appleton tower five the ones closest t two machines closest to the support office
so i presume oh wait i have the exact email
i think he's talking about sort of the ones that
yeah
the right hand corner far right
yeah if you if you enter the big room in the right hand corner i think
yeah
mm-hmm
um the thing is like you can only burn from the local file system
so if it's from s well actually i think if it's mounted you can directly burn from there
but the problem is i have my data on beefy and so i have to get it into the local temp directory and burn it from there
but you can burn it from there
how big is it without um
uh we looked that up and i for we looked that up and i forgot
the wav files and stuff
'cause i could just say at um going over s. c. p. one night and just leave it going all night if i had to
yeah yeah
no you you we should be able to get it at i don't think it was i don't think it was a gigabyte
it's yeah i mean the wave data are obviously not gonna get off there completely
hmm
see i would off i would offer you to to get it on this one and then um like copy it
but you know what i figured out i'm quicker down loading over broad band into my computer than using this hard disk
really
oh right
there's something strange about the way how they access the hard disk how they mount it which is unfortunate
i'll see if i can s. c. p. it i suppose
hmm
what operating system do you have
i've got a linux box and a windows box
okay
so
wh what connection do you have at home
broad band
yeah
so if anyone of us gets it we can then just use an ext hmm
put it on to c. d.
i can if i get down i can put to c. d.
yeah burn it to c. d. or yeah put it on on hard disk whatever
yeah
question is if you're not quicker if you uh because you should get massive compression out of that
like fifty percent or something with a good algorithm
so if you could compress it and just put it into a temp directory
i'm not sure if there's enough space
like
is how much do we get
the temp the temps usually have for gigabyte three or two
really
the temps yeah
okay
i do like i mean there's not guarantee that anything stays there but overnight it'll stay
and i think the temps usually have
ah yeah but that would have to be the temp directory off the machine you can s. s. h. into directory of s. s. h.
yeah but i can do it from that session can't i
you can compress it from a remote session and s. c. p. it from the same session
yeah they wou they'd they'd probably hate you for doing it
but
they'd probably they'd like you more if you s. s. h. uh into another computer compress it there and then sort of copy it into the into the gateway machine
do you think
they have um if you s. s. hey you know
if you if you s. s. h. and they have this big warning about doing nothing at all in the gateway machine
yeah
oh no no i was thinking of sshing just into some machine and then just scping it from there
yeah
to your home machine
yeah
i mean it has to go through the gateway
i haven't i haven't figured out how to tunnel through the gateway into another machine yet
but
can you not do that
it's not it's not easy definitely
that's why i end up sort of copying stuff into the temp directory at the gateway machine
mm i see
sorry if this is boring everybody else
this is just details and how to get stuff home from what we can probably just look at that together when we're meeting
uh th yeah
yeah
'kay
um i just um wondered so who's uh then doing um the frequencies on on the words
because i'm i think i will also um i could also make use of it um for the agreement and disagreement thing
because i um i in my outline i talked about um using the um discourse acts first
i'm sorry
mm-hmm
and um then in the chunks of text i found looking for word patterns and so on
so um i would for example need the um most freq um frequent words
well yeah
so if you cut off all that i'd won't be use or
as soon as somebody gives me the raw text of the whole thing
i can probably just implement like a five line java hash table frequency dictionary builder and see
yeah i i but i need it for my chunks then
i would
you know
oh did you not say frequencies f of words in the whole sorry did uh
yeah but i'd uh i would like to look at the frequency of words in my um in the regions of text i found out to be interesting
so i wouldn't need it
so you could just
so you'd you
it it would have to be re calculated only for my segments
yeah you'd have to count it yourself yeah
but th first uh how big are the chunks
huh
how big are the chunks you're looking at
uh uh mm
i think it would be you know l as as big at as the hot spot annotation things
so quite small then
that's quite small yeah that's some utterances
so you could just um you could use just the same thing we used to build the big dictionary
hmm
you just do that on line 'cause that won't take long to build a little dictionary that big will it
i mean just use the same tool that we use
yes
yeah yeah
yeah
so i would probably just concatenate all my um text chunks and then let's say m i will run over it
yeah
oh you don't wanna have different counts for each chunk but just like sort of for for something from old chunks
yes
oh yeah no that's yeah
so once i write an ar like w if i write like an algorithm which does a hash um table dictionary with frequency from a raw text
then the raw text can be anything
so how far are we g uh how f how far are you getting raw text out of it do you think
uh i can get all the raw text but it has to be ordered still
so
okay well that's good because for the dictionary the order doesn't make a difference does it
it doesn't need ordered no
so yeah so um i'll get that from you and i'll write the hash table which goes over that and creates a dictionary file
no it isn't
so for the dictionary is it okay if i do whatever word blank frequency or something
just p could everybody sort of start from that
i mean i guess we can
um well that's the t are you using t. f. i. d. f. for the information density
um it's in what is implemented in rainbow is information gain and i'm not quite sure how they calculate that
alright okay
like 'cause frequency would be useful i think
yeah i i need frequency as well
yeah
but um depending on the context the size and what we consider a document in the sense of calculating t. f. i. d. f. is gonna change
which might need thinking about
well i think we might have a lot in common what we calculate because i for my latent semantic analysis need like counts of words within a document
uh within a a segment actually within a topic segment
uh that's what rainbow does
i think you j can just get probabilities for a certain words for each document
certain
can i convert these probabilities back into frequencies
um we would have to look at that
okay
oh so that's what f rainbow does because that's what l. s. a. builds on
like it builds a f a document by frequency matrix
mm-hmm
oh
so i could probably get that
even though but i already have i already have my code to build it up myself
no don't bother
i have my code already
um
yeah so dave you said you need the frequency counts actually for per document would you say not for the whole thing
i think it would be useful yeah
well you need the raw frequency as well
but um
you also need how many times things occur within each document
and um what we consider a document's gonna depend on our context i think
'cause if we're looking at the whole lot of meetings we'll consider each meeting a document in sort of terms of this algorithm
and if we're viewing like say just a small topic segment you might look at even each utterance as a small document
it more and more appears to me that if we if we scrap the notion of the meeting as an individual thing and sort of ju see meetings as as topic segments and have sort of like hierarchical topic segmentation instead
then it's b like a more coherent framework
yeah but the thing is um
it's gonna need some th th thought of how we
actually maybe it doesn't actually matter
maybe if you just do it once at the highest level it it will be fine
but i was just thinking it might be difficult to calculate the t. f. i. d. f. off line for all the different levels we might want
'cause if we're gonna allow disjoint segments for example then how are we gonna know what's gonna be in context at any given time
but i suppose if you just did it globally treating a meeting as a document
it'd probably still be work out fine because you'd only be comparing to ones within the context
wait are we are we using this um for the for the for the do for the weighting in the end now this this measure you're calculating
uh i don't know i thought were you gonna use that in the end
the information density
because if we're doing like i think for for the information density we uh we should calculate it on the lowest level not on the highest
but like 'cause
oh sorry that's what i mean
like um yeah for each word or whatever but across the whole lot is what i mean by highest level
like across the whole corpus
yeah but w it don't you have to like go sort of like for in a document versus the whole thing
isn't that how it works that you c look look at r
yeah but you'd probably look at each meeting as a document
i don't think that's a good idea because isn't it like that we expect th there to change over i b with the different topic segments more
that they talk about something different in each different topic segment
mm possibly
'cause that's what relative term frequency is about that like in some context they're talking more about a certain word than in general
so that would more be the the topic segments then
yeah that's what i thought as well that you that probably the the topic segment level is the most um informative for the words
i don't know
yeah
yeah
yeah
are they big enough to get anything meaningful out of
yeah that's the problem
i don't know
so i'm just wondering if there's ways to abandon the whole concept of of meetings and sort of but just not really treating separate meetings as too much of a separate entity
well yeah that is not it's not an issue
but
you just concatenate an x. m. l. file together
but we still want to have like a notion of meetings for the user
yes definitely
but on algorithmic level whether we actually whether there's some way to just represent meetings as as topics
yeah sure
yeah you just like whatever you want to look at you just jam together into an x. m. l. file and that's your meeting
even though bits of it may come from all over the place or whatever
hmm
i mean i don't see why that's really a big problem
that's not really what i meant
but i think i have to think more about what i meant
um g i'm confused about everything
so basically what you're saying is you can take an arbitrary amount of data and process it with the same algorithm
it doesn't matter conceptually what that data is
it could be a meeting
it could be two utterances
it could be a meeting plus half a meeting from somewhere else
yeah
i'm i'm not so concerned about the m a meeting plus something else i'm more talking about like yeah
the keeping keeping the same algorithm and the same way of handling it and just saying like just this this topic here i uh it happens to be like a whole meeting and it has sort of sub topics
so just that sort of topics a hierarchical concept where like a topic where there can be super topics and topics
and the super topics are in the end what the meetings are but in general at some level super topics are treated like like topics
i don't think it's very difficult though
i mean what you do is you just build an x. m. l. file and if you want it to get down to the utterances you'd go to the leaves
and then if you wanted the next level up
you'd go to the parents of those and like just go from like the leaves inwards towards the branch to build up things like um you know
when you click on a segment it's gonna have like words or whatever that are important
hmm
mm i'm not really sure what i want
as long as like the algorithms are designed um with it in mind i don't think it's a very big problem
so sorry could describe that again the
well like say you had um like say for a meeting right you've got like uh say a hierarchy that looks quite big like this
and like the utterances come off of here maybe
mm-hmm
then when whatever your algorithm is doing as long as when you're working with utterances you go for all the leaves
mm-hmm
like then if you need something next up so like a topic segment you'd go to here
but if you were looking at say this one so only went like this
right so you it's same you'd start with the leaves and you go oh i want a topic segment
so i go one layer up
mm-hmm
see and then if you're working with just a topic segment in there it's the only thing you have to worry about
and like each time you want a higher level you just need to go up the tree
and as long as your algorithm respects that then we can just
process any arbitrary x. m. l.
file with whatever hierarchical structure we want
so that would be the series as a whole
that would be sort of m meetings yeah
a meeting say and that would be a topic segment
yeah
i'm a i'm a i'm a bit brain damaged at the moment but i think i'll just sit together with you again and and go through it again
so i think as long as you build an algorithm that respects whatever structure's in the file rather than imposing its own structure
hmm
so so i'll is th it like is this and this structurally then always identical
well no it doesn't have to be
so that we can that we can treat it with the same algorithm or
but i mean it could be as many nodes as you want
like this one could be deeper maybe
say
so then you'd start with all your utterances here and when you go up to get topic segments you go to here here here here here here here
that might be a bit confusing though 'cause you have things on different levels
yeah i'm also not sure how we can go from from bottom up
i have always thought it's like more that oh whatever i'm a can't think of it at the moment
probably this is all too complicated worrying about that at that moment anyway
mm is there anything else we should discuss
now have have we have we decided anything are we doing anything
well wednesday
s wednesday we are meeting and looking at their at their implementation in some more detail to actually understand what's going on
yeah
yeah
so we'll see if we can get like a mini browser just displays two things synched together of some kind
we had two things from their stuff just to make sure that we are like understand it we understand it enough to to m modify it
yeah
yeah
yeah should we not have like a group directory or something where we can put all our code in and that kinda thing
it'd be useful
i don't know who you see about that though
hmm
yep
how would we do that
by just making like it w read write for everyone
'kay who has most free space on their
i've gotten mm hardly any
mm-hmm
i d have no idea
same here
i've probably got a reasonable amount because um everything on my dice account can actually be deleted 'cause i store it all at home as well
hmm
well we alternatively we can probably just make another directory on the beefy scratch space
i mean that's where i'm having gigabytes and gigabytes of stuff at the moment
is that guaranteed to stay the
no
no
yeah we can ask steve if um we can get space
yeah
maybe you should send a support form
yeah uh we could do that
but i think if he sends to the i think if he sends to the port he'd probably be in a better position
just say we want some web space
listen to
yeah
yeah i'm sure he had to deal with that last year
yeah
'cause that'd be really useful is if we had a big directory
especially for transferring stuff
hmm
having said that are we allowed to take a copy of the icsi corpus
something we should probably ask before we do it
i think he said yes to that
i think uh that was like in when we were still in the seminar room
i asked that once or like ask is it possible to get it off and nobody said like people were discussing about the technical practicalities
okay
but nobody said anything about al being allowed to or not allowed to
i mean we have access to it here and i guess it probably means that we we can't give it to anybody else
but
okay
but if they give us access to it here o sitting on a dice machine
then there shouldn't be a reason why we shouldn't be able to use it on our laptop
i personally don't have too many friends who would be too keen on getting it anyway
no me neither
yeah right
i have that really excited pirate copied thing
ye
it annotated meeting data
so shall we sit together tomorrow then as well
m
uh okay
yeah
um jasmine uh um what is um the text you're extracting uh looking like then at the end
um yeah w would it be best
at the moment it's it's just lines of
because um i i think it's actually very similar to what i did for my um speaker um uh extraction and i think i would ch perhaps have to change two lines of codes to get you um for each meeting a file that says fr from um this millisecond to this millisecond there was this sequence of words
mm-hmm
and so on
um
so that's just changing two lines of code
and it would give you that
so
okay
so um you'd do you extract the words the raw text as well
um yeah
uh
so far i extracted um the dura durations
okay
but it's from the words file
so i could just um contatenate concatenate um the words instead of the durations and it should i mean
mm-hmm
print out
should be very
straight forward
i can try to do it and send it to you
okay
pe and you have a look at it will it make sense for what you want
okay that
okay
huh
so have we already extracted from all the files
yeah uh p i mean it i just let it run over all the files
yeah
so
did you also order
yes
mm-hmm
wait wait wait
i just ordered
um sorry
yeah sorry
uh i ordered according to the um starting times of the utterances
hmm
what i just realised we should really t keep different serieses completely separate for virtually all purposes
just let's be careful about that because
what do you mean by diffe
like the the icsi corpus isn't isn't one meeting series it's several meeting series with different people meeting for completely different things
hmm
yeah i mean t i i have one what i give you would be one file for each meeting
for each meeting
yeah not for each meeting series
alright
okay but like let's just be careful that whatever we sort of we merge together
i didn't do that yet
that like the highest level of merging it's not the whole icsi corpus but individual series
yeah one group yeah
hmm
might be funny to see what is summarised the whole corpus as anyway
i think we might actually i think that's probably be somewhere like well or something like it
i think it'd be very useful
but
um i think we might just get away with for the whole project just like looking at only one series and just doing within one series
i mean you can do everything you want in one series
yeah i mean there's one series that has just one meeting
oh yeah let's take that
that sounds good
is the is the data always clearly split up by different series
uh like is it easy to just pick one
yes
um the you you the data is of the form you have um three identification letter
so b. e. d. or b. b. d. or something and that's always the same group
okay
okay
okay
and then after that there's um a number like o. o. one o. o. two
so it's a
okay
so at at every level everyone has to be careful to really just take even at the highest level
just take stuff from one series and not merge stuff from different series together because they would probably be just majorly messy
yeah but that's that's really quite easy to see because they're named
hmm
yeah so so t so like if even if we make one single text file which has the whole corpus
sort of our corpus that would still be from one series only
wou but it what you're producing at the moment is like individual text files that sort of have the raw text for a whole a meeting as a whole or
yes
but i i mean as um the start uh start times um start for each meeting at zero
mm-hmm
you could just probably just um add the um final second time to the next meeting and so on and just put it all together
but then we would have to change um the information about who on which channel it was set um to by which person it was set
yeah
and that is actually stored in another x. m. l. document
hmm
'kay
um so is is anybody creating an uh a real raw text thing at the moment like which is just the words
yeah that's what i'm gonna need
yeah tha 'cause that's what i'm gonna need as well
yeah i w would then just not print out the um start and end times
yes
yeah it's just mo changing it a bit
but i but if there uh b aren't like so it's it's start and end times just for the file
okay
like is it just the first and the last line
or is it for every single thing in
no it's for every single word
we can just change the code
or for every single utterance
yeah that depends on what you want
yeah
so what do you mean by just not print out that
yeah but i do it with perl it's just string manipulation
so i would i mean i would just
okay
if you're into it can you make a text file which just like makes just the words
sure
'kay
do you want it straight flowing
'cause i would need something that marks the end of uh of uh is is yours segmented by topics then that like is there any information that you have to the topic
to the automated topic topic segmentation
no i didn't do a sea no
oh then i need something different later anyway
okay but for now if you c
no but uh that's what m. l. c. seg does
it it marks the end of each segment
okay
you're gonna put that as an output of yours the segmentation
yeah
okay so for now can you create like sort of just uh a dump which is pure text
just pure text so that i can get a dictionary and you can work on that for your topic segmentation
yeah
and
and you would want that all in one file for all the corpus
or
or for for the series
but i can but i can also deal with separate files i mean i can just write the algorithm that it loads all files in a directory or something
for the series
but i mean if you
yeah i can directly put it into uh just like
but if you can put it in one single mega file that would be quite useful for me
oh
so uh only words um per meeting series
even though for you wouldn't it be easier if you had different files because then you sort of know like
yeah
yeah for me it's better if they're by meeting
yeah
so give m give me different files as long as like it m if you could name them in a way that is easy to enumerate over them
uh-huh
like whatever one two three four five or something
yes
or just anything that i can
yeah they will just i will just take i would uh take over the names they have anyway
yeah
is is it something that's easily enu like to enumerate over
is it some just some ordered pattern
yeah yeah
okay cool
yeah one series has the um same three starting letters
so
okay cool
yeah
so only words and words and times
and you
uh i don't need the times i just need the words
but um
in the right order
yeah you want it ordered
yeah in the right order
yes
okay
it's just a wish list
okay anybody
orders
um ord base dot times
yeah and do you want
yeah sometimes they're contained in one another
so
yeah that doesn't matter too much i think
just after th mm-hmm
'kay
ordered
only words
when do you think you'll have um like a primitive segmentation by some ready made topic segmentation by some ready made tool ready
then that'll be really easy to do once they've got the raw text
it's just a case of running the script
okay
okay cool
'cause i'll need that then when it's done
yeah i mean hopefully this week
okay
um and i think um for all the corpus it's just from i know from other times
it's um nine megami byte to have i mean should be should be similar to have the words
mm-hmm
is that it
that's quite good
should be
what's what's nine megabyte
the the
na um all the words together um for all the meetings
alright
that sounds quite reasonable
that's nine nine characters over okay
that's what i'm guessing that's you know
um what i because nine mega byte is what i got for when i said for every um utterance this is goes from there to there and
okay
okay
that is for are we are we picking one particular series at the moment
takes takes seconds
or
and we could
oh
yeah i mean i'm it doing it for all of it
yes
doesn't matter
okay
yeah
yeah i guess we can probably process the data for all different series and then check which series is the best for the presentation
yeah
it sounds quite reasonable nine megabyte
i mean if you think if it's r roughly a million words and nine characters per word sounds realisti
yeah i mean i hope it will be the same for the words
it's just what i
yeah
yes i'm gonna build a dictionary then from that
like just a list of the words that maybe a list of the words with the frequencies or a list of the words sorted alphabetically or numerically
i
what what does anyone want
does this there any wishes for dictionaries
i could just use it with the frequency i think until the information density thing's finished
that would be really useful
mm-hmm
hmm
mm
so i'll create a dictionary
so so um i will probably send um just one file of the first meeting um to all those who need it so that you can have a look whether that's what you want
add add the structure yeah
mm-hmm
and then the actual file we can probably like copy from your home directory or something like it
yeah i mean if it's just for one meeting it's really not too big
yeah yeah but i'm sa i'm saying for the whole thing in the end
then like the big thing we probably shouldn't do by email
yeah
yeah
how long would it take to make the frequency counts with a java hash table
oh from the time i get the file i can do that in an afternoon the next sort of the next morning
yeah
oh you mean how long processing time it takes
no how long you would have to program something
ah it's a it's a bog standard algorithm
i've i've sort of i've written it for for dil just in half an hour or something similar
okay
it's just you put them in a hash table and and say well if it exists already in the hash table then you increase the count by one and i'll probably implement some filter for filtering out numbers or something
mm
because it's quite easy in perl as well it's just a line of code for counting all the words and yeah it's it's by hashes
really
how do you do that
okay well i don't know any perl
yeah
i mean if anyone wants to do a perl script for that that does it does it nicely i uh
yeah
i've no problem with that
i but i think i have the java code virtually ready because for dil i wrote something very similar
'kay
like for dil i wrote something that counts the the different occurrences of all the tags um
if you're doing it in java could you um serialize the output as well as writing it to a file
sorry
if you're doing it in java could you serialize the um dictionary yeah as well as writing it to a file
the hash table
uh i've never serialized anything
it's really easy
wouldn't that be absolutely massive though
i don't see why it'd be any more massive than the file
and then seriali and then write the serialization to a file
yeah
so you want like a se like a file which is the serialization of a hash table
it just saves you parsing the um
okay
file representation of it
and now 'cause i would be using it in java anyway
so i'd just be building the data structure again
yeah
i i'll i'll check if i understand how it works
i mean otherwise i can give you the code for loading a dictionary
give you my my it's just it's it's sort of it's a line break separated file you know
yeah but it seems like a bit silly to be parsing it over and over again kinda thing
yeah
yeah i'll see if i understand how to serialize
there's a there's a serialise command so that gives me one mega mother of a s
i would've thought that um i think all the collections and things implement serializable already
yeah but do they automatically write to the file anyway i'll i'll figure that out
i think they might do
we don't have to
yes is that pretty much
pretty much it
so dave and me look at how nite x. m. l. works and we're
tonight i'll try and um i'll either work some more on uh the t. f. i. d. f. summarizer or do the audio thing
hmm
i'll build a dictionary as soon as i get the text
and yeah so that
when do we have to meet again then with this
don't know
suppose we're just getting on with all our
yeah
components
so
how are we gonna do a demonstrator next week
my god
do we have to demonstrate something next week
i know
wa
what do we have to demonstrate
no no not demonstrate but like didn't you say that uh didn't we sort of agree that it would be useful to have a demonstrator of it
like some primitive thing working next week
yeah
yeah he suggested that we could have an uh initial prototype
that's gotta be very prototype
i know i'd b i'd be surprised if we can get anything working by next week
yeah
mm-hmm
ah well let's go
sorry
alright
i feel like like hanging mid air and not really like finding a point where you can get your teeth into it and start working properly and so it's all so fuzzy the whole
yeah i know
i think it's 'cause we had to specify it ourselves that it's not as um like focus the specification of most um work we have to do
yeah but it at the moment but at the moment it's also an implementational level
like with the data structures i'm just like over these vague ideas of some trees i'm f
yeah
once we start doing it it will all become more or less obvious i think anyway
yeah
it's just we are half way through the project time table
that's just what freaks me out
um
hmm
yeah
it's with cameras
hmm
you look quite funny at the moment tim
this isn't supposed to look like just
ah sod that
okay there
nice
group k.
da
yeah
yeah i guess
whatever
it's yeah i never get this so what's the point of if this is strapless if this strap's supposed to go behind m i obviously doing this wrong
obviously failing this like whatev calling centre and tra
you you have this going behind your ears the yeah
like this and then yeah you know what the shit has to do now
yeah
look's good
yeah
okay
yes so um actually i just realise i don't have power let me just switch on the other which is gonna run out
okay
okay
so there's probably not much to talk about at the moment in terms of like talking about each other's stuff i mean beyond what we've been talking about yesterday
yeah that's true i think
so what i've been thinking is maybe if we try to really make sense together of the x. m. l. format to be sure that we can all produce the data that we are producing in a way or at least i mean i guess my data i'll probably load in from completely different way anyway because it's matrix
but all this stuff that goes with annotation that we have it in the right format
maybe if we just sort of pool what we know about the x. m. l. format and try to make sense of it
i don't at all know how to go about this
um what i did just now is i downloaded
um i downloaded some
files
some x. m. l. files and i was thinking if we maybe just should go through some of them and like try to see if you understand the general structure and pool together what we think about the structure
oh yeah
what we think that things mean
and then talk about how the annotation for information density and stuff should maybe be structured in a similar way
yeah
hmm
or but i don't r i don't really have an idea like what other words what we would do today in this meeting
i mean
yeah we haven't got that much to talk about i don't think
no
just maybe talk about um how you would give me your data file
yeah
yeah
yes we can do that
what's that part
that's um the interface between having the topic segments and calculating the uh information importance of words
mm-hmm
mm-hmm
yeah
so i i would need separate files for each segment or just maybe have delimiters inbetween each segment
alright
yeah well that that's the way it works
it's got delimiters in between the mar the boundaries
okay yeah and y then i can make files of that
but
yeah if you're happy to do that yeah
alright
and you're saying you need a a label for each segment
but i mean the most i ca you don't need a one
no i don't kno know it no
well i could give you an i. d. but it'd be quite difficult to actually give a topic a title
yeah that's fine
i just i just need a a title for the file but doesn't matter what it is
right
okay
yeah that's no problem
yes so does anyone have a good idea where to start like which what so what is it we talk about getting in at the moment
we're basically just 'cause the two of you will merge your data together right
in some way like i in the end it'll result in one annotation
mm yes
so the only thing we're trying to tie in is just an additional annotation which is similar to
the annotation about what what would it be s most similar to
simply to the segmentation information or
yes perhaps yeah but i mean they're all very very similar all those x. m. l. files
okay
i had um a look at the um for example a. s.
i'm not sure it ah
mm
mm
see that's what i was thinking
not sure what software i have at the moment which would be hello
um
yeah
ah
does anyone know any good standards software displays x. m. l. i'm not sure
take mozilla
yeah but i'm afraid i only have firefox and firefox doesn't have the nice x. m. l. viewer anymore
hmm
i think i don't have mozilla
no
i can probably just emacs them
so uh we have then when we are mixing our um values together is it um a value for each um expression for each sentence or something
yeah i think that would be m i mean uh for me it's quite difficult to say o on
yeah
you know w um what scope one annotation would have
mm mm
i think it would be certainly more than one word and
i think it would work best with utterances or segments
yeah
yeah i would just end up with uh values for each word so i wouldn't have um
yep
any boundaries for segments at all
but
i just i just would have the words and then how we um how long each expression would be i don't know
but going from from a word business wouldn't it be easier to then go back and calculate for each utterance
yeah but what is an utterance
uh yeah
you know wha wha each turn so if we
i think just the segments as they're segmented in the for example in the point se point six five
okay
yeah
so what we what we would fit in into the xml files would it be uh um a value for each utterance
or what you
i think so
okay
and you would s probably still need um your values for the words um perhaps for for um the keywords that are displayed
mm-hmm
when you click on something
so then we would have to fit in more than just one where values um
mm
yeah but that's another representation then i think f for the importance measure
so d
yeah
does anyone does anyone know in which file the actual like what's it called the splitting into the utterances
but um
should yeah
um po
um is it not segments
is is called is that
yes
or is it dialogue act dialogue acts
no it's not
it's um for example there's uh b. d. b. o. o. one c. point six
is it
what does it end with
does it with with sax
does that look like it
uh i can't see anything very much but yeah that's that's it
yeah
mm uh-huh
okay
i think that's it yeah
be nice
yeah they've all got an i. d. for each utterance
let's actually just see if maybe k. right
oh this is how much time you spend just getting the right software going
is that better to see
i guess yeah white and black is better to see
yeah it's better
can you use a bigger font
so just see if i can view
okay
so
okay so here there's for um each segment um uh that's really all segments i mean it's it can be words or topics or um anything i think
this this
um that's why th it's for example time provenance dialogue act or time provenance segment or time provenance
yeah and it's got a different uh file for each speaker
but what is this
i mean this doesn't contain any content
like any text
no but it yeah
n no it just points to the to the words
oh wait somebody s s somebody explain that slowly to me
so
yeah it p oh well some of them point to the words other others point to the um dialogue acts
yeah yeah
so that's kind of the global thing that ties together other things
so what do all these things in this file have in common
what what are they
um
yeah they have their nite i. d. the time
no but w like uh so they are they are segments in what sense
wh what's definition of a segment then
the i suppose so the utterances
but also includes things like like
the segment is what is displayed in one line um by nite
okay
and
and that's usually dialogue what what's difference i between provenance dialogue act and between segmenter
i don't
yeah it looks uh uh the segment thing looks in the into the words x. m. l. file and the dialogue acts
um thing
yeah i think it's in a different
a dialogue act uh a dialogue act annotations of dialogue act
so is that just another representation of text
um
no their their annotation of dialogue acts
and one um segment can have or one um of those word strings that are presented in one line can have several um dialogue acts annotated on it
that's why
just see can we have this files somewhere
so the stuff that's
that's called segment here that do we know which file this is pulling from
from yeah it's it's c it from words x. m. l. is that it's saying here
yeah it's from words
yes
let me see if i have that words x. m. l. file
so let's for example look at
that's just below
so we n would need a value label for each of those segments that are not dialogue acts
for all those that point to the actual words
okay let me just try to get them all to a different screen
uh uh is that what we were
sorry i'm just i'm trying to arrange them so that we have one above the other so to make some sense of that
so no
here we had
but i think these segments are perhaps not exactly what we are looking at because that's just o one tying all the others together
and the information or r i mean we are going to create a file that looks more like um the words file
i think
um i'm just trying to understand what this segments file is about
like it's it's referencing here it's referencing to
to a certain position in the in the words file
yeah think so
so it's that non vocal sound one here
that's the mic noise okay
but what's the does it always just oh no it's it's referencing to several word structures
so this would be basically be a a sequence right
yes
so that's from w. fifty two
are they not ordered or oh yeah from w. fifty two down to w. what are we talking about
yeah they are
and yeah w sorry
um to discourse marker dis f. marker fi point five
yeah that's there no no up up
yeah that's there
no above
go up
yeah right
yeah
okay
so this so this is somebody saying it it doesn't
do we have any confirmation do we actually see from this file who's doing it just out of interest
yeah
yeah this is all the speaker d.
you and the speaker d.
oh
sorry in speaker d. 's file
so this is where he'd like time stops
and then it only starts at a later time because oh you don't see when i'm pointing at screen it's just for this
so then it starts here this time against speaker d. because in between there's somebody else
yes
um you can see whether there's somebody else or not
okay
you can see that in the w um w. point um first it's w. point um five uh fifty four and then it's seventy six
so there are um this number of utterances of other speakers in between
yeah
okay
okay
so the the file with annotations for information density what would that be like
would that be like the segments file giving a start word and end word or or would that
how would that be to best tie in with the system
yeah i think we would also need two of those
sorry
yeah i think we would have to have the same structure one that points to it where we tie together all our information
so we would perhaps have to make one that's similar
something like something like this or like where you give sort of a reference to a beginning and an end position
yes and uh then another one that would perhaps give the actual probability value
well that would be in the same file wouldn't it
it would just couldn't we have a like uh
yeah it could could probably be in the same file i don't know
i guess we could introduce a different um
but if you have several layers then
you can't represent them on the same file
we have for now if we just do something which for every
segment in here attaches actually can we not tie it to the segments file
would that not be the way how they would want it to have to do as if we in the end
if we want to attach to each of those segments one number for now
and those segments have uh do they have an i. d.
yeah i guess they do
so this is the i. d. of a specific segment right
yeah in segment point one
um there line below
yeah so wouldn't it i mean the problem is they've me haven't looked at the exact inner workings of their of their engineered
but you'd think that the easiest way and the way that how it's intended to be would be just
if we have here a link to the segment a like an i. d. for that segment
that we just create another file which links to the segment and then has an additional value which is the number
so you mean an a an attribute
yeah yeah
yeah
yeah that's what i meant actually yeah
yeah oh sorry i i thought we were talking about having two files
i was think yeah i i think that i i understood wrong
i thought you were wanting to have two different x. m. l. files with one the reference and one just th just the number
and i was thinking that's probably what you meant just um having like for each sort of of our segments having just the i. d.
which is referencing to these segments here and another attribute which is the the value
mm-hmm
so this whole information we would then store in this ah no
that i don't have access to because i didn't download like there's this one meta information file where it describes the structure of all the files and describes which um which attributes they bring in
so we would add that to that file
mm
saying that sort of we bring in information density
and then we would create the file of that type which we probably couldn't call it segment
i'm not sure
we probably might have to have a different word for it
i'm not sure if it there's any trouble with it repeating
um
wouldn't it be easiest to just incorporate a new attribute in in this file
in the existing segments file
yeah i don't know that's probably not very uh nice but would quite easy wouldn't it
yeah i reckon actually if we make a copy of it
but i i mean there's not all the information that is in in the c corpus in there in the segments file
yeah
i think that is just the um things that are loaded every time but we have lazy loading so it can load more than that
perhaps we could just try to cope
um you know to
make our file one of those lazy loaded
but i mean i've no real idea how that works
what uh what are you saying about the w i th doesn't the lazy loading apply to everything
i mean that it sort of dynamically loads
yeah but yes but it has um you know a basic thing that it loads i think
so for example every time it loads the segment things it can't it can't not display words i think
you think it i it l it loads the whole of the segments file every time
and it eras
i think so
that's how i understood it
okay
the segment at the moment is split up over
because otherwise in the in the other things there is no information about what the participant name is and so on
so
in the segments file it's really the very basic that have to be displayed for any thing
hmm
but they display the segments in or that the utterances i in their um
user interface as well where the words are y um displayed
so so they have they have their utterances displayed in their interface
so that's they um access probably this file and then they display the words
so why shouldn't we be able to do that
uh
no but i think it's too early to really like discuss that in detail
because we don't at all understand at the moment how the internal data structure like how the loading works
so maybe if we g if we go ahead
do you think it would be possible for you to do an like something like segments or maybe just a copy of segment which has an attribute for for each segment
um but it is like with a with a value with a density value
yeah i thin i mean it wouldn't be difficult to um create a file of the p sh of that shape
i mean that would be no problem
would it be easier though because all your methods are sort of not working with their whole time frame structure there
so would it be easy for you to to tie the things together
like if you're doing it on on the word basis here with those words that in the end you then tie it back in into the right segment here
i mean
you probably have to do a bit of
um yeah i i don't know how about you with your words
but um for my segments were the um f. zero measurements and all those values i get from there
hmm
um i always store the beg uh start and end time of everything i calculated there so i would just have to pu put it uh yes
you're doing it time based at the moment
so this isn't directly having time references but you can get the oh it is actually here
yeah it is
okay
so if you slice it up by time you'd probably be able to just like attach like just some attribute of
info val just f to each of those segments
uh actu but actually my segments are not always the same as their segments because and their segments there are um pause um pauses sometimes
mm-hmm
yeah can you not just leaves those lines blank
a
um yes but uh yeah i mean one segment of theirs is sometimes two segments of mine that's just what i meant
oh alright
okay
'kay
um i don't understand enough of what their data structure is
this probably would be a lot easier would i really understand how they are handling the data internally 'cause then we c then i could say oh
it's easy to just tie it in if you just have it time stamped that just reference by words and stuff
but t at the moment
so you would you're doing i you're doing a word by word base
yeah the problem is probably that um i extract all the words and then uh i don't um use an i. d. or something for it
mm-hmm
so it would be difficult to write it back to the right position
okay
but every word does does the word picking like does it always have the same information value in your thing i does it depend on its position like
it depends on the position i think
it be d depends on the position
yeah
hmm
and you're doing this via some software that's like external software so you can't
yeah i i could use another a different approach though
so what if you if you if you get the results from that software and you go back over it then with that file sort of
it
you write an algorithm which which then goes back because they they're in the right order still and stuff right
so that shouldn't be a problem
mm yeah
oh but this is by speaker here which makes it slightly more difficult
hmm
the problem is that actually nite x. m. l. probably provides a lot of the tools that we'd need to do that
yeah but for example i made a file that contains just the um start times
mm-hmm
it could contain end times and words for all speakers of all meetings
i mean that's just the same thing as i gave yeah as i gave to you
in in a temporal sequence
but um uh displaying also a start and end times of every word
so you could perhaps use it to match um it with your additional information you got couldn't you
yeah what did you use to make that file
perl a perl script yeah
just in perl
you didn't use an x. m. l. parser
no no
okay
um would you think it would make sense to just take um file files by speaker
it's it doesn't matter what input i give to um to rainbow
so i just could g use the files as they are
i don't know if that's that would give an output
but but would the information density algorithm still make any sense if you split them up
hmm
i don't know
because i mean the whole i thought the whole thing is that you look at the frequency of a word in that specific how often a word inc occurs in a certain topic versus how often it occurs over the whole corpus and that from that it calculates
mm yeah
no it um i think it's not uh versus the whole corpus
it's um you have certain categories and you measure which words um have the highest information for one category
mm-hmm
so it's the categories across each other i think
but would you then not get the typical words for every speaker
if you
um probably yeah
but yeah it's it's s strange
yeah i have a gut feeling it's not a good idea to split it
because it would then say how it find that it's that speaker
yeah
no but i mean it can't be that difficult
hmm
if you if you already have you have in the right order all the words with a with a score to them
yeah
and you have a file which has each word and a time stamp
yeah
so those two tied together have each word and its time and
it's probability yeah
and and and its proba and its value
or or value yeah
yeah
yeah but what what the problem is i don't know exactly
i think the information gain in rainbow is ordered by the value of the information gain
not i am not sure if i can get the right order and the values
that's the problem
so they're they're at the moment so
but i um if the order stays the same it's no problem at all to i just write back again
but if uh it's ordered by information gain i don't know where the words come from because it's it has a bag of words representation
hmm
it appears to me that rainbow was made for something quite different
uh yes
is it is
it was made for text classification
hmm
so could you put the more information back in then
yeah that's the problem
i actually like um um i are you actually sure that rainbow is doing a measure like is returning a measure of what we are trying to measure
'cause it it seems to me that it's just it sounds like something quite different in in d many aspects
yeah um what it actually does is that you you put in some documents and you have several documents per category
mm-hmm
um and you have several categories
and w
and then it measures um which words are typical for a certain t category
yeah
and if you get a new document it will um compare which words are in that new document
yeah
and if there are a lot of words that um are typical for one category
it will assign it to that category and if it's typical for another one it will assign it to that one
but where do you have the original category information from
yeah it's because you have um y um you have um oth different files
if if this is your directory you have um um a diagra um a directory one two and three
yeah
yeah
and this represents the category
everything that's in there is in category one
so where do you where do you have them from at the moment the split up
a
yeah but the topic isn't it
yeah just split it up somehow yeah
that's a topic information
in i in the t in the topics in the in the human topic s um so you've split them up by topic at the moment
yeah
no i've just um split them up uh somehow um by um there are several documents for
um each meeting and i just put one in each category
yeah but
so uh it's it's not very sensible at the moment because i'm waiting for the um topic segments or i'm just yeah
okay okay okay
'cause i was just thinking that doesn't make sense at all but yeah if you if that's just while you're waiting
okay
have you ever like looked into different ways of calculating 'cause i was just thinking like i mean the for example the the infor um what's it called
the entropy calculation is that she boxed it under the simple calculation that you could probably write the script in no time at all and
yeah yeah probably
yeah maybe it's it's better if i write it myself because otherwise it's too easy to just split things up into bins
and it it wouldn't be any work at all in terms of programming or something
yeah but i'm also just like i think that probably the entropy value at the moment for a word is closer to what we're at the moment looking for
i can just like k k i can sit together with you for twenty minutes and just show you the entropy code that i wrote for my other project and it probably and we should work together because it's we used t we have to we'd use the same matrix as i'm using in my latent semantic analysis
alright
you'd use to calculate entropy scores
mm-hmm
and then we'd have um a score which actually which would be the same for the word in each position
so in that sense it's doing something a bit different
mm-hmm
and like w basically the score that i'm talking about is a conditional entropy score which just checks how much information
the fact that there's one word tells you about what would be the next word
mm-hmm
but that's a relatively good measure of whether that's a very specific word
in which case they are usually words which tell you quite a lot or a very general word which usually doesn't tell you quite a lot
yeah
how does it calculate that actually
um it it's basically the it's the standard entropy formula
okay
and you sort of you you
so how sure or unsure you are about the what's following our b our context measures yeah
yes yes it has
i mean
i think the official le sort of the official description of what it tells you is um how much that like the fact that a given word occurs tells you about what's the next word's gonna be
yeah
which doesn't sound too exciting
but it it just works out in the way that words which are promiscuous and which occur with everything all over the place have very low a scores on that
and also usually end up being the words which are p
least like expressive and l contain less information
well like function words and stuff
yeah function words or just very general nouns
pr probably like what whatev for example the word computer in that context
you could imagine it to f like be in all in all the contexts
mm
but do we have enough informa enough data for that it gives us sensible things
because i mean the the words we're look really looking for appear not too often
and if they appear five times in the meeting and they have each time a different
you know differ some different surrounded words perhaps we have not enough data
yeah so we would we w wouldn't do it by word we would sorry okay
um i was i was getting that w actually sorry i was getting that wrong i was getting it from what i did my project
now in this case we would do it by per mee words per meeting
so
yeah but that's the sa uh almost i think similar to what i'm doing because words that are in every class
i don't understand what you
that are not very informative but words that are only in one class are are very informative for that class
hmm
yes it it's probably doing it's probably doing quite the same thing in the end
but i'm just saying like with that thing you would easily have an algorithm which at the moment provides you for each word with a score which we can use
oh okay
alright
um no um i was i was i was describing the wrong thing
in this case we wouldn't be doing how much it tells you about another word
in this case we would be doing given that you know a word how good is it at predicting from which um specific topic that was
yeah okay
so that would yeah in that sense it's the same thing here
yeah that's th yeah
mm-hmm
but that would give the same value for one word every time i mean for for a specific word
yeah yeah for a specific
yeah because then it would be quite easy to re integrate it into such a
for a specific word per
yeah
the same word the word yesterday would be would have the same score all over the place
per
all over the place
and in my case it would have i think it would have different uh values for each category
okay
but in that category it would have the same value at each place
do you know what i mean
i c
okay but then it would also be possible to re integrate it
it would be more dif i mean it would be a bit more work but then
but but your category thing depends on that we not just have topic segments but also that these topic segments we have them in categories
yeah
you you do wouldn't you need several documents for each category
or several segments for each category
um that would be best but i i would have to look if that
do but will it word without that at all
um at least it works if there are several categories with each with one document each but it um yeah
'cause
yeah i mean s so in our case basically every
every s topic would be its own category
and the question is does the algorithm still make any sense in that i don't understand the algorithm enough for that
yeah that's the questio yeah i don't know
but what i'm really like because the entropical um calculation is so simple maybe we should look into making that score just as a preliminary score that we have
mm-hmm
mm okay
like it it's a very it gives you like i've looked at the result
it gives you basically something in the end which vaguely tells you just whether a word is a very specific word
or a very general word
yes
and
i like there is some hope that probably having just sentences where there's lots of very specific words
if you mark them as being more interesting than the words which are only very general words that they would get us somewhere
um and what well what score would a word get that just occurs once in all the corpus for example
probably one point zero is very high information value
even though there are all the other same topics where it doesn't occur
yeah 'cause this would
yeah in in a sense i mean this is a bit like the what like document frequency over total frequency
mm-hmm
measure it sort of just going by
hmm
so would it be higher scored than a word that um occurs
in
every um sequence of the same topic
what do you mean every sequence of the same
yeah i mean um we have uh s uh our several topics
for example we have twenty topics and um for one of these topics there are five occurrences and we have one word that
mm-hmm
within th within the topic so like topic we had to when you say topic
you mean like just like from from a beginning to end point like within one meeting there are several topics
yes but across meetings um there will be the same topic several times
but we don't have that information anywhere do we
ah
it wasn okay
i thought that was what you were doing
well um when it splits the topics up it does do it on regular words that um that occur
yeah but
but it doesn't tell you what they are no
but but you you are segmenting
yeah but you make also um segment similarity i think that was i i thought that would
hmm
well i'm i'm doing one on segment similarity in the end yeah
yeah
i'm doing like finding similar segments basic latent semantic analysis
but
but like f for now like your segmentation is just splitting a meeting up into different blocks ver
yeah
yeah you can't really get any other output
and they they are not related then to other blocks of
not not from what colin is doing from what i no
no
okay
no
it's only like i'm writing an algorithm that which then tries to also again based on word p occurrence patterns try to link together maybe different ones of those
i um
oh okay
i misunderstood that then
so
so yeah how would it work
i mean what would
um the his information then be useful for in r rainbow
um i thought the point about that was that we would put um into s um serial categories all the segments of the same topic across meetings
so that yeah
oh no i li i th i thought something else that we d um we just split i need somewhere to split
okay
and that um splitting at category boundaries um splitting at topic boundaries would a nice thing to do rather than just splitting somewhere
mm-hmm
yeah it's supposed to split it into cu coherent topics with the similar information
so yeah yeah
yeah but but then it does okay
yeah i'm also a bit b like i'm not a hundred percent sure about rainbow being the right thing
'cause it seems that rainbow does in its structure quite rely on having different examples of the same category sort of in in a way
yeah but it i think it should work for just one document because it it compares between the categories
and if you just have one document um it still can find out which words are informative for that category and which are not
so if you have just one document in each category and there are a lot of um occurrences of the word the in each one
'kay
so this word will be not very informative across the categories
mm-hmm
hmm
so it should work for one but i'm not sure if how exactly it it um calculates everything
uh i think it's not possible to look that up
you know what as a byproduct of my l. s. a. i'll provide um a vocabulary like sort of a dictionary which for each word gives an entropy score entropy score
which just tells you of how much information the presence of a word tells you about which topic it is
not which category like i'm not i'm not lumping together separate topic segments into categories
mm
but just like how much this word tells you about wh how likely that w the occurrence of that word makes it that it's a specific segment topic segment
mm
which is some measure already of how widespread this word is versus how specific f to a certain segment that is
and i'll just provide that because that's just not much more work than just the usual thing
and then we can see how we can tie that in with the other stuff
so if you um keep on working on rainbow meanwhile and try to find a way how to tie your rainbow stuff into
yep
some way that we can attach it to a certain time segment
yeah maybe it's possible to have a list that it's o that is ordered by
yeah don't know
i'm just thinking wh if
it it used is each word completely unique like sort of does it treat each word each occurrence of word as a completely unique event
or does it i mean no it it has to i mean basically the the form of the word is important right
we can't just replace the word by an arbitrary string
mm-hmm
because it looks if the same word occurs again and stuff
um i don't know what you mean by that
yeah it it has to work with a m yeah well i think it's a stupid question
it's uh
like it it it has to work on on on the word like on
what i was thinking is whether if we replace the word by something uniquely id identifiable then it wouldn't make a different which order it is
mm-hmm
oh right
but that wouldn't work because it needs the word because that's all it's working on
it's the word and that looks if that word occurs again and versus how often that word occurs in other context right
mm
so we can't attach some type of information to the word just to the word string itself
yeah
like making an underscore making the time or something that wouldn't work
mm yeah
alright
yeah you you can use um
some kind of um truncation maybe if you attach a number to each word and say that it should omit the last part
but would it have that in the untruncated version then like would it s would the output be the untruncated version
uh probably not
it will probably um no i don't think it would
no no
yeah maybe i should try something different and just programme it for myself
because um
yeah for now i mean really just like
yeah i think if we work together on an on an entropy based score
mm
it's let me see if i can demonstrate
t i mean let's just keep on talking meanwhile and i'll try to start that up
it's it's it's really d it it's a very simple thing but it it basically just
does something which tells you how specific a word is
in a sense it's in a it's it's basically just to to a high degree really telling you how r how rare a word is or how common a word is
mm-hmm
but uh as as the first step that's probably for for a prototype for next week that's probably not a bad thing i mean even if it's just that
hmm
even if you just like if you have segments where where lots of rare words occur highlighted in darker red than segments where all the very common words occur
yeah
that's just that's somewhere to start from
and it's it's a bit more sophisticated than that but then de facto it just ends up doing that mostly from what i figured out
um
actually i think i'm not gonna not gonna start that now because that's probably gonna take too long
so
if we get it on a word by word basis whatever you do it'll probably appear in a word by word basis
and what you have on a sort of segment but not quite segment base
mm-hmm
yes
yeah i mean i haven't really decided on uh how to really get the information out of this now
because um when i have for example um increased speaker overlap that applies to several turns of course
but i could give um the information about yeah how how important this is to each of those segments
'kay what about the following model
i mean this is a very unscientific way of doing it in some sense
but what if we if we take time as the standard unit for now and sort of like make a massive one segment split super array
because everything you're doing can in one way or the other be ti tied down to actual time
so if we if we if for if for each one segment time slot we could attach a value
and then it would be easy to then go back when if we have the time marks here
and re map that onto onto the length of a segment you know what i mean
so if you have for each word say and we know that word starts at this segment and ends at that segment
and you have for like for some time period w the overlap and that period on the f. ones and that period or something
so you also have a value which can be tied down to a time
and then we could just in m in matlab or in something just create some massive super array of
of things for each for each like sort of time sampling slot and and calculate a value for this and once we have this array
we can go with the script and sort of go for each segment to the starting and end times and say okay
this is from our time segment f here to this time segment there
so we take the some of those and divide them by by the number or something create the average and put it in as the value for the segment
you know what i mean
yeah but how can we get to know what makes sense as a a function for joining everything together
oh
might be difficult to find that out
tha that's that's a fiddling play in the end but that problem we'll always have
yeah
because we don't have a useful way of automatically evaluating um
we don't have a way of usefully evaluating automatically what's good and what's bad
so it's it's probably always gonna be a question of looking at it and saying okay
hmm
like running it with different different factor loadings and seeing okay this way it works this well and this way it works that well
yeah
pros um but you proposed um we we should break that down to have um the smallest um smallest um unity um of time duration should be one word
i mean that would be because that would be what naturally came out of her thing
hmm
mm-hmm
but it probably be more difficult for mapped t to map for you to map it on so for you sort of i
and
yeah sure but i could then if i if i have um the value for a segment i would perhaps just give all the
important wor or mm yeah no
you you could always find out how many words there are in an utterance couldn't you
yes
yeah
so
yeah but so you say that inst like you basically say w having an array where each each cell is is one like is o is one word
mm-hmm
and then you would map your information onto individual words
yeah i would say that someone have to break it down aye
hmm
i would probably somehow have to break it down to to that level yeah
would you be able to find out which word that is and
yes sure
'kay
and and then we could have like some type of just point in the end where the one scores from the all the individual word cells get multiplied all with like for each utterance or whatever
you have get all multiplied with the same value all the ones that are within that utterance
that's sort of the combination of of the two scores
yeah probably somehow it should work that way
for example
and then we'd have to go back again and then put that back into that segment mode here
mm
so that we because in the end we don't want it on a per word basis but probably on a per segment base
yeah but then okay but th at that moment it would be better for me to just make it on a per segment basis right way
so but
hmm
mm
and let her adapt it also to the segment basis
oh yeah yeah actually that yeah that's true so that it's easier if you
mm-hmm
are able to yeah well i think that's probably back where we started at this
but you said it wi but you said it's more complicated because your segments aren't those segments exactly
yeah
yeah i mean mine are only more but they have the same start and end point
sometimes they're two segments and one with a gap in between but um the have um th th they don't overlap
hmm
hmm
and their segments do overlap
no no they don't but um
uh the tho those do or those don't
um
they're i mean my segments overlap in the same way as theirs do
but sometimes i have um split one of the segments into two segments but it's easy to match the start and end times to map it to their segments
mm-hmm
okay
so you could on their granularity you could on their granularity create a score like for each for each of their segments
i uh hope so yeah
mm
well i guess i mean for you if you know for each word if you find that out then it has to be possible
yeah then we sh yeah
because if we know sort of this is going from word to word or it this is going from time to time and then there has to be a way then for you say okay
this concerns these following words and then just make make a simple mean over them
i think an interesting thing is if we don't combine your two scores in the
in the x. m. l. file you had but if we do that in the software
then we can probably make ways of playing with it in the software and sort of l you know like adapting some sort of control
like playing around with look like it's playing with different weightings for that the utterance based one versus the word based one and sort of look at it dynamically
you know what i mean
like playing around sort of figuring out what's the best way of combining them by playing around and looking at the results
mm-hmm yeah
we could even yeah we could even have a look at our different measures if they um
that would be quite difficult but yeah
come up with the same same kinds of yeah
yeah
yeah we could probably like make a uh um graphic display initially at least for our experimenting
we'd just place them in different ways and then see how they interact with each other
yeah i mean that's what i'm already doing with my s uh separate
okay
yeah
so do you think y like both of you then can map something onto their segments like just each of you provide one value
like double value or whatever like one decimal value or whatever onto onto exactly their segments
uh i think if i can provide something for the words as they are
it's stated from where to where the segments go
it should be uh should be possible
it's stated both in
yeah it's tells you even which words it is
yeah so it must should be possible
it's done both in terms of words and in terms of segments
it's a bit sad sort of that we do this before we've truly figured out how the nite x. m. l. thing works
yeah
hmm
because now we're doing it all by hand and like parsing and un parsing that thing and it's it's all part of the framework
yeah
uh
how much easier would it be if we truly understood this
oh i'm sure it'd be quite straightforward some of the tasks we have to do
so
mm-hmm
but yet no one really understands them the actual x. m. l. parsing
'kay
i might just change my order of in which i do things and like forget my latent semantic analysis stuff until the weekend and try to really make sense of the
of the nite data system now so that maybe as soon as i've understood that we find ways of doing that in within the nite framework already
so that we don't manually have to parse times and entire things together
you mean by matching strings
or what
well
at the moment what you would do like to to solve this problem is you would sort of like write some perl script or something that gets this time value out of here and
yeah but what i've done is um a parser an x. m. l. parser where you can get the start times
okay
so yeah that's quite easy because it's it's an attribute and you just s say that you want the values of those attributes
mm-hmm
mm-hmm
so provided that you get your words in the right order
do you think it is an easy task for you to it it's a f relatively feasible task for you to to get just a single value per segment
i think that should be possible
i don't know how long it takes me
but
okay
and you say you think you're able as well to map onto those segments
yep
should be possible
and if you're both able to map into those segments then we should be able to get one file where we have like whatever two values
value a. and value b. both as attributes for
mm
for this
and that we could load into a prototype and see what types of disp what ways of displaying this information are there
yep
yeah i hope to have some value quite soon
but um i just worked um i mean i just calculated the values values for um the average f. zeros and um they're what's c i mean i didn't have a look at the data yet
but um they vary quite widely even for the same speaker across meetings
hmm
so one speaker had um an average of about a hun one hundred um in one meeting and one hundred sixty in another meeting that's really that's strange
mm-hmm
hmm
hmm
i mean perhaps it's because of laughter or something that's what i was thinking but i didn't have
there's probably also social interaction factors in that there's sometimes just a meeting like if people adapt their f. zero to each other then they're sometimes p
i'll probably look at it
yeah that's what i read in one of those papers uh as well but
yeah
yeah but it could mess up things quite considerably
can you not do something like just like not measuring the f. zero or the amplitude at all
but just like the variance of f. zero within a certain time frame and like sort of like just have some part for its very low variance with more the same f. zero and one where there's a lot of more variance
i don't well actually i don't know about that at all
yeah
but uh ar yeah
but all this is quite you know data intensive
yeah
i when i um let the um just calculate the average f. zero levels
sorry
it i think it needed more than half an hour considerably more than what have half an hour f to delay it for our meetings
mm
hmm
because um yeah m i mean we have seventy five hours per yeah
av average of six speakers and they're measured every o. point o. one six seconds
and that gives us quite a lot of values
okay
so at the moment you you just you measuring the f. zeros relative to the average for the speaker or
yeah what i did at the moment is um i um yeah i got the f. zero values from for each speaker for his headphone
mm-hmm
and i only take those um the w uh that were recorded at the time where he was actually speaking
mm-hmm
and for those i calculated um the average
mm-hmm
zero
ri so the average
so that gave me um now one value per speaker per meeting
okay
um so what you would be feeding in would be just like one value per speaker per meeting
so that oka that that's that's your average baseline okay okay
no no that's just the average
no that i yeah
no yeah that that makes m yeah that makes a lot more sense yeah
so that would show you how much relative to how he sort of how he's performing generally in that meeting relative to that how he's in a specific segment
he or she
yes i mean i r just uh needed to have this value now to relate um m how yeah
yeah
yeah
and for you that would be quite easy to translate into those segments
yeah guess i've asked this question fifteen times now
yeah i think
yeah
is laughter annotated at all
sorry
uh
um amusement and so on is yeah
because you could take that on ours out maybe
if you take the laughter out and then calculate it
yeah
i i i mean it i actually have to look at the data what causes these um
mm
yeah
hmm
because it's quite funny to have a m male speaking at two hun two hundred um
oh they w they do exist
yeah sure but
the castrati corps of the international computer science institute
oh well
i'm afraid i have to go soon
but not quite sure i mean is there anything more we have to talk about anyway
not the moment
maybe if we meet at the weekend
oh i don't know
yeah
see as soon as as soon as i'm halfway through my l. s. a. like basically as soon as i have the the matrix built
if of the document by word stuff it's very easy to then calculate for each word a score
yep
and i can just give you those scores and you can do with them whatever you want
so uh no how about the the prototype
if we want to show him something on monday we definite have to work together
some of us at least have to work together to get it running probably
yeah i think colin dave and me will actually work on on the java stuff
and it and we'll just see whatever you whatever you supply us we'll try to tie in and visualise in some way or another
alright
um i'll ask jonathan if we can postpone the meeting to one o'clock
yeah that sounds like an idea
so that would give us a chance of meeting in for an hour before that to discuss the questions that we had
yeah
yeah just send us an email and tell us what's happening
yeah i haven't gotten like sort of my confirmation that w wednesday is fine
i'm not sure if i'm supposed to expect a confirmation for my confirmation from him now or but i'll just email him again and s ask him if we can maybe make it one sorry
we said twelve and i'm asking if he can make one
this is a bit frustrating at the moment this project isn't it
it's so like difficult to to get to the point where you understand enough to really feel that
i don't know i'm not feeling that i'm really working at the moment i'm more just trying to make sense of everything
mm-hmm
and it's a bit too far into the meeting for that and into the project for that
yeah and i am at the moment fiddling around with my data and not quite seeing how i get to a sensible abstraction level you know
hmm
from my very
i guess as soon as we have a framework in the w in the type of the prototype where like sort of each of us can tie in their stuff and see what it l how how it looks like and how it performs
you know
that probably makes it a lot easier then but it's sort of it's a boot strapping problem like for the prototype we need some type of data
but to develop the data it would be a lot easier to to have the prototype
yeah
anyway i gotta go
yeah
so i mean you will be happy with some data even if it doesn't make much sense
yeah me too
hmm
yes but if it's if it's in a form which is easy to read in at the moment that would be fine
sort of like if basically if we have something like this segments file but for each of you like just have one attribute
i think it's really easy if we don't merge them before hand but if we let them if we combine them in the prototype or don't at the moment
because then we can easily d display them individually c contrast them to each other and play around with how y to combine them
try uh try yeah
mm-hmm
yeah and also we don't have to recalculate if just one
exactly yeah
yeah
and i mean computationally multiplying two integers or doubles or whatever shouldn't be the thing that slows us down
yeah if it's already on segments base that's not too much
yeah
okay
alright
right
ah yeah
okay
okay
okay
okay
yep
did i tell you that we've got kind of two way interaction
if you control click an utterance it will play where it should be in the file
yeah
no i'm just like sort of like preparing people for um it looks like it looks like really nothing
it looks like basically less than n th their stuff
but actually dave has written a whole underlying different structure now and if we hooked it up with my display
then we should fairly easily from now get to a stage where we can like select individual segments and click on them
then play that part in a compressed way and display density information
now at the moment the application is
we should probably set those sizes 'cause that's such an easy thing to do
yes sure but so at the moment we have a dialogue act window and a graphical display w i'm not sure
are you missing the sound
no the interesting thing is the sound came when i tried it last time after i i triggered off something by clicking on something
oh there it is
yeah there suddenly they come
probably they're just slow at loading
and they don't have the buttons yet
yeah
so at the moment the display is still dis coupled from it
it's loading your data i'm not quite sure is this it probably looks like vera's data from from the looks of it
that's vera's data on the display
but the segments are just made up aren't they
yeah the segments are made up at the moment but the code's there for integrating real segments
and this is summarised based on just vera's data at the moment from some part of the meeting
so we're we're not loading the whole thing at the moment yet properly
but the important thing is this is summarised based on i i realise i'm always pointing at my screen and you don't see
so this stuff is summarised based on on these intensity measures
and we don't have the exact audio record for this
usually say we should have just copied it
so just to show dave has put a uh music file in there and the music file is playing without gaps
that's because the way how we handle it at the moment is that dave prepares an audio file
mm-hmm
creates an audio file dynamically from just the chunks that we wanna have and that runs in synch with what we have in the
i'm not even sure why i'm making loud
it's just
so we see that running along with playing
of the music we see the the highlight of the dialogue acts
right
that's pretty good
you can also control click on the dialogue acts and it will play that section of the file as well
okay s
so and and that already this part here already is dynamically created
um shall i just load it with jasmine's data just to see a different where's the
yeah if you want
oh that one looks almost com just you need to
so uh which version of my data was that the very first one
the original the very first one
quite old
yeah
yeah we were b like doing this we were just concerned with the whole stuff
okay
yeah
yeah v i mean really doesn't matter
and dave where what am i looking for
just wanted to know if i'm just
am i looking for in data manager
where am i looking
um it will be in program
or is it f is it where the is it where the file names are
is it here
where do i call your display
is it uh sh is it here where um words importance file
no it is on your display
um where it calls which one to get you just need to change the flag
in my display
um i think it must be unless i it
uh let me t
how y how do you do the summary
is it
oh no actually yeah you can change it for in the summary when the summary gets called in program manager you can do it
i d
just
so are you basing it on certain thresholds uh over a special d uh s okay
no not yet
it's just picks the top ranked ones at the moment
okay so wh where did you say in prog
yeah the easiest thing is in programme manager where it makes the summary
it's probably the best place to do it
w you know where that is just about
it'll be above that
above that
it'll be down
like in
it's gonna be after the data manager's made
in this main in this routine
yeah that
a new summary
there is something read importance with a zero and there is read word importance with a one
yeah th can't remember where i put it
shall i swap those around
hmm
maybe it will be in s the summary constructor then
yeah try the summaries constructor
well wha wha what what's the differe so th this is reall
well it reads them into separate arrays and then you can just change a flag to select one i which one it gives back
yeah
shall i just swap the file numbers around from now
yeah if you want
or would that crash anything
uh that should be fine
oh yeah and and we really leave a
maybe have to find out where
yeah i should make a new constructor that lets you set the flag
mm
mm
so you have time this afternoon
yeah
yeah
so here
so this shows if we see anything at all then we see at the moment at least that we are definitely be um having a different summary
just because we're having a different im um important measure
so you see that um i it does something
like at the moment i think this was yeah yeah that's an old old old version
oh that's the old old one
yeah
okay
so it shows um and so if you if you think about how the old version happened
okay
mm
then you see it makes sense that words like prosody just like a sing if that was the only utterance then that probably scored quite well and stuff
um
we have to get these buttons dave
yeah
yeah
yeah probably
it's weird
on mine it complains about
probably all these uh-huhs and uh hmms are spelled differently in the thing or what's the problem
yeah
you should generalise
unfortunately i didn't get the the bar on the display working just yet
okay
but that should be a small issue
ah ha
that's a very old one rather
i think those s. s and e. s and so on the single letters are because of the problem with my um first version of the text thing
yeah i know this is very old
we just never bothered to update the stuff because we were working on so we see that we have a very different density curve as well for this one
'cause i think the
and
yeah so from here we go and it hopefully won't be too difficult to now first of all put the right segments in
put a sliding bar into this so that people see where they are
so i'm uh i'm i'm constantly touching stuff on my screen i realise
and and then make selections based on a segment
now what we're not quite sure is what's the best way for like how the summariser works
should it always compress a segment to a constant length though by a constant factor of time
or
what would you think sort of if you know if if there's a certain degree of of summarisation what should be the constant
hmm
mm i suppose it should depend on the length of the segment
so always like a
so it should always whatever reduce it to half the original
mm i guess that would make more sense yeah
'cause an al like an alternative view would be that
yeah but but perhaps more than half
yeah
otherwise you go in too slowly yeah
yeah well i guess that could be uh adaptable
'cause an an alternative view would be that you could sort of make it that it always is the same length
so if you like if the whole meeting is selected it compresses the whole meeting to five minutes
hmm
then if one um segment uh w one topic is selected then it plays this whole topic in five minutes
but that's sort of that gives people a bit less control over so maybe we should do it instead that it yeah it c it you can spec
i think that to be honest is something we can worry about at the end
i mean that's quite trivial to change and we got a lot of other work to do
yeah
hmm
what's that you discussed for today though
what's there to talk about for today
yeah i was wanting to talk about the search
yeah we need to get on that pretty shortly i think
yeah
yeah i'm quite keen to do like most of that
like make an index search and stuff
okay so i'll need to do some changes to program manager to be able to handle um changing results
yeah i think what basically what i need at is um just a list of words with an index to start with for each meeting
what kind of index
um i suppose it doesn't really matter as long as they're unique and it can i can pass 'em back to you and you can use that to the display
take and make them in a hash map or something
um yeah probably
shall we abandon the whole notion of seeing the whole m one whole group as one single thing and just work on a p certainly from now on probably for good that means
certainly for now yeah
i mean
yeah
yeah
oh yeah do you want you know how you've just got data for one meeting are you needing more at the moment
um well from the point of us developing it it doesn't really make much difference
mm i guess not
no
do we have everything for the same meeting at the moment
um
like is it are you y are you all working on the same meeting
yeah i think we're all using the first one
hmm
okay
did anyone ever check if that's actually a good meeting like or f comparably to others
um i think it segments quite well though first one
'kay
so you want to send steve the prototype and we should change data
where's the best best place to put it
um uh sorry the only problem with the first meeting is for ex that there's no um a hot spot annotation for that
oh
but i mean that's not not a real problem
m
do you um take it from from my directory
or do i have to put in in the sh
um well at the moment it's just a an old file
yeah but would you take it from from my directory
it'd probably be yeah best to make a copy of it
or okay
i'd have thought
i don't think i'm gonna be able to do um the speech tools through java native interface 'cause the documentation for them is horrific
it's really bad
so i think i'm thinking i'll just write out a script and do it with a system call
yeah
'kay
yeah
not yet
yeah the i just don't think it's worth wasting too much time on it
no
yes it's not really important that we get it like nice and c clean or anything like that
yeah
yeah especially because i mean that's that's that's only done like once every time the selection changes right
hmm
so even if you sort of even if you do an hourglass at that moment and you know
even if it pauses for ten seconds well that's tough luck then
i don't think it would take that long anyway
uh
think we should just make sure that if it takes quite some time that that the clock doesn't start before or that the audio and the clock are in synch sort of
yeah yeah
so yeah it we just start everything after the summary's been created
so th
it's not a big problem
yeah
yeah
there's a wait for command for an external ca like for an external call to make sure that the external thing is finished because in general like that's sort of running parallel
i think
yeah
yeah
i have some code for system calls like that handles the in and the output if you need some of that
um i don't think i'll need that really 'cause i'll just dump out a temporary file
okay
okay cool
um i don't really know what to talk about
we have
see there's there's one week after my dissertation
so we're f uh before the presentation of the prototype
which i can work a lot lot lot on this
so that's good
um
i think we should decide what we want it to actually look like in the end
'cause are we gonna have some kind of tree view to represent the meetings and stuff
mm
because if if we're not then we'd probably have to make the graphical display display a bit more information
yeah well the graphic display will definitely have more information
um if we're at the moment abandoning abandoning the concept of displaying the whole series of meetings just because it's for us like more bureaucracy
more complexity and it probably just won't give us any brownie points in the presentation
mm
or do you think it will i mean do you thi like
i uh think it might
why because um i um steve lay quite a lot of um weight on um you know uh surfing through meetings
so we should at least provide an overview of different meetings of one group
at the beginning he um talked quite a lot about that
i c
it's not too difficult to do and it's sort of a hack kind of way 'cause we can just treat it all as one meeting
we're
as one meeting yeah
yeah and then maybe have some basic information
like if
but we'll just create like hard segments at the start and end of each meeting
like ones that are red instead of black or something like that
yeah
so just a little bit of ad additional information in the display that knows where meetings picking it over
and otherwise internally we treat it like so we have continuous i. d. s for the segments
mm-hmm
yeah that works
so other than yeah other than well we'll just create a hard boundary in between each one so you can see the thing
yes but apart from that we don't really do anything different as if it was just one meeting
yeah
i mean that's quite a cheap way to do it
yeah i completely agree
so the only thing it would be that the display gets information about where they are and displays them as hard boundaries
um and what about the similarity measure for segments
do we um also present that in this window and do we do it across meetings
um
uh i think that was planned at the beginning wasn't it
yeah so the initially i thought it was sort of more a search functionality um that simply there's one button that says find similar segments
yeah
and then in the same display where we display the search results from the search
uh okay
wha
so it wouldn't be displayed in in the uh graphical display
well i'm not so you think displaying uh like an information about similarity to the select uh like to a selected meeting in to a selected segment in the other segments
oh
um no
i i'm just coming back to our initial idea of presenting some you know
all the similar segments in uh across meetings and separating by uh some things like
no no i think that's i really don't wanna do that to be honest
um it would be nice but like just
it might be possible to do it in the summariser
yeah but i it it should appear as a continuous thing f for the yeah
yeah it will still appear continuous on the display
but i'm not i'm not sure if it's worth much bother though
mm-hmm
like if we do a s like a similarity search
and just like you say find me similar segments and then sort of like you have a list and you click on one of them and then you go to that segment
i think that's quite useful um even without displaying them sort of dis continuously
so how are we gonna display the search for this corpus
well i was thinking of just like really just a m more or less just imagine those are search results each like each of them sort of them sort of giving whatever
we should aim to get some names for segments like just some extraction of something that we can call
and if it's just the single highest um importance measure o phrase of a segment so that we have something to display for them
like basically just a summarisation down to one segment
hmm
and it would just be a list like this and you click on one and then w you tho you know
yeah yeah yeah
yeah i think so
then the whole bureaucracy kicks in like this gets the nota notification this gets the notification
yeah
okay
and then we could like we could sort of use the same thing for um yours and mine
because yours would sort of give just the segment i. d. s and mine would give the start segment i. d. s
yeah
right
so basically this display would have information about a segment where something starts
maybe se well maybe also something where something ends like for mine and some string that we pass to describe what like what it is
yeah
you wait your search what would it return
would it return just the specific like it would go right to the utterance right
yeah i suppose my search will r it returned the utterance
but if you're searching for a word you need an index for the word and the utterance as well
yeah sure sure sure
um yeah
so in in your case like it would basically would probably say the utterance here or at least some part of the u yeah
um it p it'd probably select it yeah
it would make sense to do that
and in my case it would say some name for the segment and then you would just click on it and then like the whole thing would kick in
yeah
like you c you click on it and and the selection moves and the display goes to that part
okay
how advanced are we gonna have our search
because i definitely think we should restrict it to i think we should um be able to restrict it to specific speakers and things like that
very very basic yeah
yeah
yeah yeah
if yeah if if you can pass me like the dialogue act with
but nothing too fancy
yeah was it the speaker
do we have them with a speaker at the moment
and then
oh i uh well with a speaker i. d.
it
yeah that that should be enough shouldn't it
okay cool
yeah in fact if someone could create a file with the speaker i. d. s and speaker names
'cause you can
oh yeah i d i did that yeah
just random sp
oh i i have that file
that done
okay
yeah i d i did that as well actually
so just
where is it
is it in the group directory
um yes in the data
yeah group data speaker data or something
okay
yeah it's um the data manager should be quite well documented
yeah
so you should be able to use that for the search quite easily
right
yeah
so what about
is it sorry could i d use that
at the moment it's ready to like get dialogue acts out with
uh from yeah on the dialogue act level
i've not got it reading in the topic segments yet
yeah
just 'cause that was lower priority
yeah yeah
but yeah all the you can get all the utterances
alright
yeah i should maybe just get started with 'em
making a search with that
so what about a general layout like this that we have here
the dialogue acts and there the player b and here we'd have a search button and the similarity thing button
hmm
so where are gonna put the search results
i mean we can
ah good question
um
if we move everything to the right a little bit and make a little bar on the left
yeah
yeah like the search results in there
yeah
yeah
i think we probably like we can leave those like i. frames and just arrange them sort of
yeah yeah
yeah
like we'll basi yeah
we'll get something to print out their locations
so we'll arrange it in a nice little order
alternatively we'll have like the whole thing running already when we do the presentation and we just arrange it manually
we
yeah
my c
it's quite easy to do though
so i think we probably should
uh apparently microsoft sometimes or like at least in the past the demonstrations where they just exactly knew which five percent of the system were working
and that's what we're gonna do as well
yeah
has anyone ever seen anything from the other group
no
uh we should try running that thing again see what it does now
they have all ah
yeah
they have all sorts of sc scarily good
or just delete or back up it
yeah of course we've got here
that would be evil
oh j so i can print obscene messages in the background to um standard output
yeah
oh dear
if anything we build in a time bomb that only fails if the date is the date of the presentation
oh
yes because we are nice people
dave this rate thing do we have any direct control to that
or is that just directly controlling how fast it plays and sort of we can only
it doesn't seem to work very well
it's capable of slowing down the audio but speeding up doesn't seem to work at all
that's a pity because it looks like it's doing something
you have to pause it and play it for the
did you overtake that code from the original thing
yeah that's uh their clock component
'kay
yeah but also speeding up the audios and s
oh it's all part of the same component that does that
um do you think if we override their component and just override whatever the the action to that slide bar is
uh no we'd have to look in their code and see what it actually does
this thing is really bizarre
it slows it down a bit
the speed up doesn't seem to work
yeah maybe it has a different constructor when you create it
yeah
also their grasp of algebra is terrible
is it
well yeah it shouldn't be minus two times it should be half
oh yeah
i suppose
'cause that'd be playing it backwards twice as quickly
yeah
so if so something like their skipping would it actually corporate with our system at the moment
would ours skip automatically forward
uh it should do but you've probably gone past the end of the file
yeah i realise
maybe that's the problem
maybe they have got um the minus in the code as well and then something in is messed up
i don't know
uh
i think it's just um it did do it
it's that bright selection
uh-huh
yeah whatever
so do you think a tree view for like an overview of the whole set of meetings would be good
be yeah uh
i think this simple this simple st view that we get that you can just like pass things into and then check when they got clicked really
yeah it w it would look good
either that or another
something that might be quite cool is if you could um you know like some applications when you open a file you get like a little preview
if we could do something like that that displays like a five line summary when you you're about to open the file or something like that
hmm
yeah i suppose you could calculate them off line and just yeah have a like like a l little thumbnail or something
hmm
yeah
well couldn't the summar oh no then we would have to override though
the summariser is quite quick
it could probably do it dynamically
yeah
i mean it would be a bit pointless but it would look good for the presentation
yeah it'd look pretty and i'm not convinced you'd get any kind of good quality summary out of it in only five lines
yeah
i suppose
yeah
hmm
but i in a sense i mean if we see uh yeah but like probably that would be the same thing that we also display up here
but
because i really think that having like some but that would probably even be shorter than five lines
like really just getting i think getting one or two best utterances for each segment would be really worthwhile
for the search results i probably think that instead of a p a simple summary
something that displays the utterance where the where the word was like displays in a highlighted form where it was found
hmm
another quite good thing might be um how are you do you know how easy it is to apply two tips to things in java
to to apply what
i've never done it before
i've never done it but i'd imagine it must be quite easy
'cause what would be quite cool is if on this search result you could give it each one a tool tip that had the context
like the utterance before the utterance itself and the utterance after
yeah it'd be nice for a presentation yeah yeah
so that when you hovered over it
well alternatively we could always have sort of a third small component whatever
like if this was the search results
and then they are just like something else that's part unwritten when miles goes over this one it triggers that one to display it or something
but yeah if we can get the tool tip we should use it though
and a tool tip is i think a very straightf yeah
'cause i think it should be quite easy
it especially with a preview we'll be able to get tool tip fairly simple because it's just a property of it
hmm
yeah that's what i would have thought
uh i've never seen tool tips displaying several lines and stuff though so i wonder how good that'll look
but we'll we can try that
um it's quite common in like some applications
really
yeah
well so far only seen tool tips of few words length
but yeah uh that should be fairly easy
um where we have a moving band the graphical display that also moves according to the
yeah yeah we will have
that's actually just gonna happen today and we will have proper segments as well
yeah
hmm
is that quite easy to do to get um a moving cursor
um the thing i remember like i have to find out how to do it without redrawing the display each time
because the display at the moment does take
you see like it takes a fraction of a segment to display but probably too much to update it to completely repaint the whole thing every second
so um at the moment i'm just whenever it needs to be repainted
i'm not thinking about to do and just repainting the thing as a whole with a moving bar that's not a good idea
but until i think of something better
what i'll just do is i'll just i'll probably not have a moving bar the whole length but just some indicator somewhere
like whatever just uh a triangle moving at the bottom for now or something
hmm
and then i can just like repaint a small area or something
um all you need to do is just one value
and the area could be smaller
um the height it doesn't change in value does it
so if you just remember the colour that it was last at and you re draw a line behind it of that colour and then the next one
yeah
yeah i have to find i have to find out the the commands for like really just redrawing a small small piece
so i have to just there's examples t um for for doing stuff like that
i just have to read up on it
but yeah displaying the the current position bar will be easy provided that my whole calculations of like where we are in time here are all correct
i mean that's just something that isn't tested so far
yeah
but it should be
i mean
so the the general concept
will will you two just uh keep on working on improving the information density measures or do you think there'll be a point when you say well that's that's it
we have we have an information density score and and we'll be looking for something else to do
or
uh f i'm pretty sure that i can uh always find something to improve there
so i mean if you need me to work on something else um i can try to finish my stuff um early
okay
but um otherwise i can still keep working on it improving it i think
'kay
well i'm actually at the moment i don't see how many people can work on on the programming anyway
no right now it probably won't be that much benefit
hmm
right now it probably won't be much benefit
no
yeah as soon as i've finished all the meetings i think there's not that much to do unless i get some evaluation method
but that could be quite difficult
i would have to tag uh some part of it or something
did we
because if i d if i can't evaluate i can't do any better
mm-hmm
mm-hmm
mm-hmm
because i don't know how to do better if i don't evaluate anything
mm-hmm
so this is the component based evaluation he was talking about yesterday isn't it
yeah
yeah he's really keen on that isn't he
yeah
yeah
yeah
yeah
well i guess i mean
oh so that's a bit annoying 'cause like it's my hope we could just go cobble something together and just say look it's great
yeah i was just gonna do some sort of informal evaluation
mm
uh i was a bit pissed off yesterday about that part because it was sort of just like a decision we had taken
yeah
so okay we've been talking about evaluation l in the first report and there's nothing new we can say about it this time
yeah i did say that
and i thought we said that in the meeting before we wrote the report
yeah
yeah
and then he came back with this whole criticism saying like oh
you didn't say anything about um evaluation and then yeah but we did that in the last report
we said we're not gonna go oh but now i expected it in more detail and oh
yeah he did give us eight out of ten though
if that translates to eighty percent like if if those actually translate to to really like their percentage scores then that would be good
yeah
i think they do 'cause that's the first um sixty percent or isn't it
hmm
sixteen
'cause it's i thought they were thirty percent each
yeah
yeah
what
no i think they were ten percent each
i don't know
ten percent each
only ten percent
yeah
yeah
yeah
there were forty percent each and this is how they became sixty percent now what okay
i thought they're thirty
um how much do you think there were
i think they're worth ten percent
yeah
yeah ten percent
ten each
yeah
not bad
we also it it just means that he's relatively lenient because i mean the reports were i think they were ok good reports
but like probably somebody else wouldn't have said they were excellent
so that's a good sign 'cause it shows that he's not hell bent on
hmm
yeah i suppose he can see that we're putting the work in
yeah
uh and then he'll see the final display and he'll realise that it was all fake that we didn't actually do any of the work
no but it's
'cause i think we'd rampantly underestimated how long it'd take to do the actual uh software engineering bit
i
yeah that yeah that interface and integration yeah
see the thing is
like for me personally i think a lot of work will be done in in the last minute in this specific case
that's not a new statement at general
but
like the week just before the presentation i have most of the stuff that i i'm doing now i'm rid of it including the dissertation and dil
mm
mm-hmm
yeah same for me
see i'll probably just be starting stuff then 'cause i'll be starting the uh s. n. l. p. thing and the d. m. project
so
oh yeah
hmm
oh no i forgot about that
what are you doing for your d. m. project
um i'm gonna do like an on line museum archive
you get like a document for each exhibit
oh
is yeah i kind of nicked the idea
he went about code m. l.
i'm gonna make one for guitar tablature
oh yeah
oh that'd be quite a good one actually
yeah
but i i think it might have been bit off more than i could chew
so i think it's gonna be quite hard
yeah would you have to do like music notation and stuff
mm well tab doesn't usually have music notations just um pitch information
right
okay that's n not so
uh
see how far i get anyway
so jasmine if if you got something like this and like this for for your current data would that help in
um
i sort of have been promising this for a week now i realise
yeah
i'm gonna give you
don't know if it's that n yeah it might be of help
uh 'cause it's empty at the moment
yeah
i mean dave i it's a pretty much r it sh should be a question of copying it over it r over right
mm yeah
so i just didn't
well you can easy add a command line parameter
it's not essential though i think
yeah
can probably add a open file dialogue box with minimum effort because i think it's a ready made component that returns a string for a file name
mm
it may even return a file directly
or that w yeah
possible
so we can do that today
probably
um the thing is it i don't know
yeah
it doesn't really make sense to call it file open or anything like that 'cause that's it's more like an option
to set the par
yeah but why don't we
because it reads everything just from one file
yeah i know sure it j like it it would not necessary need to be a part of the final thing
but why don't we just provide some means
even if it does it automatically in the beginning as a start up option just to ask for a file name
mm-hmm
'cause then we can just publish a script that you just run and then this whole thing starts
hmm
you know what happened to me today like i forgot about the whe i'm not sure if we had that problem before
finding the java media the java x. media stuff on all the jars for that
oh yeah that did happen once before
yeah i was like suddenly panicking at eleven when i realised god i just thought it would be very straight forward to get it going here
and then i got that thing
yes so um if we do a version which automatically opens up a file open box
you're yeah f so you're automatically producing the right format with this no um with just per utterance
hmm
uh yeah f per utteran uh i print the utterances in the i. d.
okay
uh no the the i. d. of the utterance and uh the measure i think
mm-hmm
so would it be easy slash dissu difficult slash impossible like at the moment if we skip to a s treating a whole series as one thing
so like creating one file for the whole series that gives the uttera the ideas from top to bottom and
or even just the entire corpus
that's what um colin's file has got
that shouldn't make too much difference
but the entire corpus
it
if i just take well m a file or where one meeting is in or
concatenate all those shouldn't be too bad
hmm
does his
it's it's easy to load that much just text
yeah
where do you think you can uh produce something like that
like i think we should go for like for one group not for the whole corpus
uh i think it makes more sense to go for the whole corpus because the meet the um the i. d. s gonna have gaps and stuff in them otherwise
and it means you have to read through the list of utterances when you're compiling all the data over and over and over and over again
so so you want um the dialogue act numbers to be um continuous throughout the corpus so that second meetings begins with three hundred um something
no no n
yeah
yeah
yeah
yeah
yeah no but dave um yeah so tha that's what i was thinking that like the second meeting should continue till the first one's stopped
a and for one group that's true because it's sort of like their meeting's you know like that one meeting and then
well a at the moment the main data i that's just uh uniquely numbered throughout the entire corpus
hmm
well at the moment from the dump file it's just got them uniquely numbered throughout the entire corpus
hmm
the utterances
hmm
okay and and that's the
and it makes more sense to do that anyway because um that means you got more flexibility with how you want to group them
and one thing you really don't want is ever to have two utterances that could potentially have the same i. d.
but it just doesn't make sense in the logic wise
sort of like until here it's the meeting about this thing and then it's that thing and then it's it's this like
whereas
yeah but that's the point of the data manager is to manage all that
couldn't we couldn't we just um take the um a name each um each dialogue act um meeting dot um dialogue act number
it's possible but it's it's not really much point
it would be a la longer name but
'cause at the moment it's got quite nice property that the dialogue act number also coincides with the array index number in the array of dialogue acts
which is quite nice
whereas uh s mayb maybe we're talking k like so so your data manager would that then handle the whole thing
would that handle it that this would only like the display would only display one group
well you could you could choose whatever you wanted
yeah so if i mean i don't mind where it's done
so if the data manager filters it out and like i just think that in in the logic of the programme it's it's much easier to justify why we say we treat a series of meetings as one single thing rather than w
but you may not be interested in the same series each time
you might want to display all meetings that had a particular phrase mention say
and those might not be the ones that we enumerated as one meeting in which case you're gonna have conflicting i. d. s and things like that
but a
whereas the da if you do it in the data manager
you can control any logic like that programmatically rather than doing it by hand and setting it in stone for all time
i b like would just i would find logical reasons for why you can sugg say peop
well it's just good practice
like it separates the data from the programme logic
what you're talking about doing is embedding some of the programme logic in the data
uh but i see this two completely g def like i see each ser each group is completely separate amount of data that shouldn't
yeah but that's a decision we're forcing on the user when we don't have to
okay
but would it still like would we still in the logic of it still have continuous i. d. s if we say we take just just one meeting
like would would the display for example still be able to just say i want from whatever from the first until the last and and everything in between sort of and and the data manager would then display that just for that meeting
yeah i don't see why not
okay well if that's possible yeah
have you currently got continuous i. d. s for your topic segments
well i have i've only done the first meeting
but yeah th that's the plan
oh okay i thought you had done all of them and
um for the topic segments
yeah
yeah sorry for topic segments i have
yeah
but for the utterances i've just got one meeting so far
mm-hmm
but the idea was that it would be continuous
yeah
okay
i think it sh everything should be like that continuous in chronological order
okay
is that what v what you've got because um because the different meeting series overlap
i think
yeah
remember how did i do it
a problem um yeah
hmm
i don't know
for example as there are not um f. zero values for every speaker or on sometimes not for every meeting um how will i count that up
i'm not sure i haven't really looked at the data
i mean
if there's no value i guess you have to put a zero in
ah okay
at the moment i don't even generate any document uh document for those
yeah
but because i mean it's not zero it's just a noun
hmm
well it might be more sensible to assign it an average value
but wouldn't it be better for the importance measure if that just wouldn't be part of it then
the
well we'd w only use f. zero when it was present though wouldn't we
hmm
we well we'd want to use f. zero when it's present
yeah that's what vera said
no
so you you'd you'd also say that it shouldn't be part of the importance measure if there's no f. zero
yeah
yeah
well i i don't know how we're gonna do the fusing of the different if inf importance measures anyway
yeah
bu if that's done in the programme or if that's done off line
i th think it should be done in the program 'cause we're probably gonna want to change it
yeah in the summariser it'd be the uh ideal place to do that
yeah
yeah
yeah
does anyone have a good idea like at the moment to play around with it
what's a good way of displaying two types of information in the in the colour display
i mean uh there's probably logical ways like if one is whatever if one is the darkness and the other is the redness or something
has anyone ever experimented with sort of displaying two dimensional information in in colour
because then we could do jasmine's and and vera's probably in the same scale
you could use um red green and blue to display up to three
yeah
yeah but do we really want do display them separately because the user won't okay for now for our s okay
f for now
no for now
like yeah for us
might be interesting to the user though just the word importance maybe
yeah but then the user would have to know about what s w was what and what contributed to the blue stripes and what contributed to the red ones
hmm
s
yeah
yeah i think we sh we shouldn't
t
we should assume a n assume a non linguistic user
uh i think that wouldn't be a good idea
but i think probably for us like in developing it it would be interesting
mm-hmm
yeah so um i'll try the red green blue
wha what's does anyone know what this hue and saturation thing like what that no nobody's done much colour work
well i don't know how to do it in java
but
oh actually it's not a problem of doing it
like i think it's
the trouble is that hue isn't a very sensible scale
like it comes up to like red two or three times and stuff like that
okay
okay well i guess i'll just take a look at the photoshop colour cube or whatever it is gimp colour cube and look at
or you could just split it into two blocks i suppose for now
yeah
yeah
'kay so we'll produce a version of this which opens up with a dialogue box um where you can select a file
is that right dave
would we be able to do that
yeah
and and then you'll get this type of display with that file
and that's uh at the moment are w so are we are we still talking about using that one meeting that everyone is using now
are talk about swat swi swapping now
well there's no reason why it can't swap meetings at the moment if the data's there for it
switching
yeah
so everyone should produce stuff for the whole corpus now
or
yeah that's most sensible way to do it i think
okay
okay
we need the explicit information about each meeting then
like sorta whi from which utterance which utterance it goes and stuff
yeah that's well it's not reading that in yet but that will be part of the data manager as well
is anyone is anyone providing that at the moment
like there's access classes all defined for that
i didn't does any
yeah it's in your file isn't it
mm
yeah
'cause each utterance has got an i. d. associated with it
yeah
okay
okay
okay
couldn't we couldn't we write one programme that calculates all the um f for all our different contributions to the importance measure the um a absolute um dialogue act numbers for the meeting
because at the moment we all produce the numbers for each meeting separately
i don't know
well if you
so just keep yeah just enumerate up for the next number
three
yeah but we should all use the same programme i think
hmm
would prevent us from having too much mistakes in it
or at least uh the mistakes would be consistent
yeah we should be consistent yeah
yeah i'm not sure about
that
as in i just don't understand much about how difficult it is to do to do different things
no it's not really difficult
it's just
yeah i mean i can do it
i can read in the different um importance measures and then re re calculate the numbers
well as l as long as yeah
as long as everything's in the right order it shouldn't like we should even be able to just i. d. it when we're reading it in
but we have got the index um for converting from vera's i. d. s to to yours
so it shouldn't be a problem should it
hmm
yeah it should be easy to do yeah
yeah i've done that for the correlation as well
hmm
so that's what that was quite easy to do
'kay
have you got that for no it's just for one meeting at the moment
yeah i've got the indexes for all the meetings i think
oh okay sure
yeah
yeah so if we email out a script on how to like f load it
um so yours would always like yours would always be loaded in i guess
like you y there would only be one version of your data and you can just override that version if you want
but you wouldn't have a file open dialogue box for that then
no i don't think so
well that's what i meant is it's a bit pointless having it as file open 'cause it will be opening those files all the time
it's more sensible to have it as an option and the location of them
well what would the option be
or just so you can configure the the location of all the files as an option
but when it starts up it should just read them from the default place
okay
but like so make it an option which one it displays or which one it uses for the summarisation or 'cause it 'cause i was just thinking sort of so that both jasmine and vera could um see their data working and
yeah that makes sense
oh of course t there's no reason why we can't make a development version that displays both has two win utterance windows and uh two graphical displays
i mean obviously you it'd have to pick which one to synch the clock to
mm is that not getting too much
to add another dialogue act window is really easy
so we would have like each of those components for
for jasmine and vera
oh like say if you could make a um change to your thing so it could display uh like it in two halves
yeah i know
so like the top half one the bottom half the other
yeah
yeah
or maybe three actually
maybe top half one bottom half the other and the third one an average that we can change the parameters for
mm-hmm
and then yeah i could easily make it throw out three different dialogue acts
but would that not require three clocks and i but that but but that also means
no i'd just have two of them not synched up because it's just for evaluating the data
okay
'cause the dialogue uh the display also gets the information about like the relative and the absolute times
so that would be convenient if that just if there's just one of that 'cause otherwise it's getting messy
oh right yeah i see what you mean
so why don't we just make a swap ins why don't we make a switch instead like
oh no no it's still good because um
oh no it isn't
i don't wanna do like three like three internal time scales so that's just getting messy
yeah i know what you mean
yeah
well i guess really i mean like alternatively why don't we go for the simplest thing and just create three scripts or two scripts which load a parameter uh f common line parameter
yeah i suppose
which is which file to load and and then it's just there
no hold on you it wouldn't need three internal time scales
'cause only one's synched to the clock or it c and the others are all absolute real time aren't they
okay
that's what's displayed on that the bar is real time isn't it
yep
so they would all be in the same time scale
okay
would the others
oh you oh you just have three summarisers and then they're all synched up with one clock
no no only one of them synchs and two of them are just yeah
okay the other one is just a static dialogue acts box
'cause it doesn't really matter
they synch up for the purpose of evaluating the data
okay
okay
yep
so we have three colour displays
like three or
yeah
i mean not in the final version just for now
no no sure
or maybe just start with just two like without even combining them in any sophisticated way
just just two
yeah
yep
'kay shall we wrap that up
sor sorry i'm imposing
how easy would it be to make it so you can add arbitrary numbers of them do you think
you mean discontinuous
no like uh different measures to the display
if i have to do it f like flexibly then i probably then it will not be significantly more difficult
but is it worth any effort though i mean
well that's the thing if it's gonna take more than like an hour or something it's not worth it
'cause we'll never have more than two and we'll never ha well we'll either have one or two
yeah
so in the end 'cause you don't have different versions of well i guess you probably would have
mm
but then also we'd have to find more sophisticated ways of loading it specifying the parameters
mm
so that might
but that's easy 'cause mine can take uh any number of parameters
yeah but that we wouldn't so we'd have to have some dialogue box for opening stuff
it might be it might take half an hour in the display and not more than that
mine i'll need to make a minor addition to the data manager and the summariser
hmm
but it's more or less ready to go with that
but it might actu i think it might not really be worth it to be honest
let's work on the other stuff first like the other stuff
and just provide like something where each of them just if if there's uh a jasmine script and a vera script and they each can load their stuff and see their data in in the thing
they ca they each can see it summarised by their data and the other one is the static one
okay
that should be fairly easy to do right
yep
if i just double the display and you make a uh like a non synched up second dialogue acts
mm-hmm
yeah should be easy
and yeah and then they can tune fine tune their measures
i think it would be cool if we could check the nite clock f code or whatever code it is for this component and see if we can access those rate things and and do something useful with them and get notified when they change and stuff
we could just make that rate be something completely different
just disconnect it from whatever it's doing and then have that set the length of the summary or something like that
yeah i think
yeah i think that's what we should do
so the the thing is it's probably an easy task to read that rate but it's probably more difficult to get an event automatically when it's changed
so that's why we might have to extend nite clock and like override the function that react to that
or like the rate is probably a property which in the worst case we'd have to set public
mm
but if we wanna react to it being changed automatically we might have to
well it doesn't it doesn't react to it being changed automatically
it only reacts when you press play at the moment
okay
so they haven't sp okay
so you have to stop it and start it to make any effect
yeah so it shouldn't like even if to even if uh if we have to extend nite clock
i mean it should just be a matter of changing one single method in it
mm
yeah i mean just disconnect it from whatever it sends the media player and connect it up to our summarisers
yeah
yeah
that makes different length summaries
yeah
'cause like we could make that not even have like a a real sort of meaning just put like max and min
hmm
and the user can just like set it in between wherever they want the uh without actually telling them what it actually means if you see what i mean
yep
yeah
yep
and we could justify all sorts of stuff like that by r in the presentation by saying we deliberately tried to keep any complexity and numbers and stuff away from people
yeah
i think that's sort of a line we should go by in general sort of saying yeah we could've done oh so many th
we should certainly take away the labels that say minus four times as well
'cause that's incredibly unintuitive
we don't wanna confuse people
we give people something simple and colourful where something is moving and where they don't have to l deal with any numbers or text or anything like that for that matter
in fact that's why we've given you a picture of a dog sitting in a field instead of a meeting browser
it is nice and it calms people down
so what kind of change will you impose on the summarisation
because if we fine tune uh um according to that and it's not finished it's n doesn't make any sense
well
but it won't make any huge changes like it'll always have the ef the ability to read the original ones
okay
right
but it might be quite cool to have a combined measure
uh-huh
like just a weighted average is probably the most sensible way to about it and possibly thresholding it
hmm
okay
so you at the moment you have got a threshold and everything that's above it is displayed
or how do you d
no it just takes the top like twenty or fifty or however many
yeah so it's some kind of threshold that is set okay
yeah
yeah
yeah
shall we meet in an hour or so dave
i'm probably gonna eat something quick
um well i was gonna go to the gym at about three
so
ah okay i was actually i was planning the same but we won't get so much done before three that's the thing
or to be honest like it's much quicker for me to get stuff done on my own
it'd make more sense for us to divide up spend a couple of hours dividing up tasks and then do them separately
'kay listen so why don't we meet after three then because then i can like until three make sure that i have all the display c
well it'll be after four then
'cause i'm gonna go at three
yeah sure yeah
the gym
s oh so we could meet at five and i have the display code ready by then
which does the stuff like like having a bar where the position is and stuff
okay
and
so meet say five till seven that should be enough time
yeah
because yeah it's much quicker if we're both working separately i think
'cause when we've been working together like i've just not got a lot done
yeah that's true
and like when i go home i'll spend like the same amount of time and get loads done if you see what i mean
yeah
yeah
so we can meet in five in apple at five in appleton tower and just work on so i'll i'll have my displ i'll make sure that my display does all the stuff we've been talking about un until then
yeah okay
and then we'll put those things together
okay
yeah i'll be working on the search i think
it's ready to get started
so you're gonna be up there as well then
yeah i may as well come and you can show me how it the manager works
yeah
yeah
but i mean like we we should discuss together which w like how the the search interacts with the rest
so that's not something that colin should just do in his own
sixteen times zero
i'm not a hundred percent sure but i'm not having crashes at the moment
so what i'm having is so we we had a we had a long problem about not finding out why the time synching up between the relative time in in a in a sort of in a in a summarised section and the absolute time didn't correspond and stuff
and we found it was some stupid well
at the moment our best guess is that it was some stupid java thing about if you if you actually if you have two objects and you say object if you say a. equals b.
they actually reference to the same thing
yeah
so any changes you make to one are made to the other and if you do that around five corners
you lose track of it and you suddenly wonder why that value is zero
and it turns out it is zero because it's the same thing that you anyway uh so we figured out it's interesting
why don't i have a screen here now actually that's new but that's okay
it's doing different things all the time
like this is the first time that actually the but uh uh that should be okay that should be okay
i'll i'll be able to
yeah but last time i pressed that key combination everything went wrong and i think i'll be able to do it just fine on the screen
so that'll probably keep me from pointing on my screen which i usually it might just be at this point
like there's sometimes a point to loading not usually that long
well let's see
anyway so n uh let's just see what happens
in the end we did get it working before
oh see i get yeah
yeah
ah so now i'm having a complete mess of like split
split screens and stuff
i think last time yes but that's not what we want is it
so but i think if i this is a log out command and usually it resets this amazing strange colour combinations i see in front of me at the moment
yeah we somehow always get it working but in different ways every time
um
so that kept us like basically from doing anything else product qu for quite some time in the last days because we were um hunting down that stupid error
i got it fixed in the last whatever one hour or something
but so at the moment the program is sort of in between working and not working because we've done lots of changes to what the error was
dave i think actually that the summary at the current moment isn't working a hundred percent correct
but that could be because of the input data
it seems to just take the first utterances more or less
does it
i have to check that out
yeah
like if you if you first if you read through the summaries they read suspiciously fluent like as in people's questions and answers
hmm
and then if you plot them on the screen where where they are at the moment they seem to o
it depends which data you use as well because um if you use the data where they're all really high
it does prefer ones from the beginning because it just picks the first ones it finds
yes
so maybe that's where the problem is coming from
but i'll check it out anyway
yeah
um
so this is when you start shifting around your laptop to think that it gets somehow less sloped on the screen
um
so i'm not really sure what this meeting is about to be honest
um i'm i'm gonna show this just what we have at the moment but it not gonna look very different from what we had last time
don't ask him what happened to the promise that you'll get your script where you can use your own stuff because actually that was sort of ready but then we sort started trying to get something more working and then we got into big problems
so at the moment i mean again we should be at a state where people can load their own sc okay
yeah
i've got time now
like um for the next couple of days i'll do some on it 'cause i was just too busy last week
yeah
thing is a at the moment it's just really bad for me
but from monday on i can just do twenty four seven for this one until it until it's due
but until monday it's gonna be really bad
like i can probably help people if they have problems with getting getting what we have running now
but
okay
so i'll just start it up what we have now and then we can talk about what different people have and stuff
what's that that's creeping over the other screen
i know
huh
doesn't look great does it
eek
yeah it doesn't
but sometimes you have to take whatever you get and then just see how far that gets you
that's really weird 'cause it's just started creeping over
yeah uh so let's perhaps uh in the meantime talk about the um um numbers we assign to the dialogue acts because um yeah
i didn't know that you left out those who don't have words
uh uh
so i just extracted the actual dialogue numbers
and the problem is um it's perhaps more um dangerous to get mistaken with all those numbers and not knowing why things happen if we just devote numbers and n make new uh n n
um well as long as the two correspond then it's fine
yeah sure but i mean for all those measures that are based on words um i can automatically just throw those where it's nothing
but um those dialogues acts um like thirty three in in the first meeting um they have a duration even though they don't have a word
mm
um so for my earl other measures i i get them and i don't i mean i would have to look for every single write a programme that looks for everything a number and does the mapping for that
oh right i see
okay
so would it be would it be easier if there's a reference file with the actual real i. d. and the corresponding number
yes
yeah there is there's index files already
so
is there some already
yeah
why is that
yeah in the raw text index directory
mm-hmm
yeah and it uh allows you to map between the different i. d. s
so would that solve the problem basically
yeah i just wanted to uh um why do you think it's necessary at all to do that
because the whole programme works on them being numbered at the moment
yeah and it's a problem if there's no
um it'd be a lot of word for really no extra p feature gain at all
but actually i think there is something in the audio shouldn't there
if there's um even though there's not a word i think in the audio there will be something at that point because it has a duration
or do you think it could appear in the summary
hmm
well if it's something in the audio that's just like a noise then we don't want it
yeah i guess
'cause we can't show it in the display
so d you cut it out
yeah
yeah they've been cut out the ones that don't have any words
yeah
suppose
but would that not happen at some sorry i'm jum jumping in
would that not happen at summarisation anyway even if they're in the w like with the ones that have no words and then not have really low information density or something
huh
i don't i don't know
you 'cause the thing is it depends if we want to have it display the whole thing at once
hmm
'cause you'd reckon that you could leave them in and they would never show up in a summary anyway
if you left them in hopefully it wouldn't affect the way the programme works
yeah i mean but why do you have a special for those
no i guess not
well i don't in the programme it's just they're not in the raw text files
it's just
hmm
that's just 'cause they would have a blank line in it
seems a bit stupid
yeah
but i can fit 'em back in if
yeah uh i mean it's just a question i wanted to raise
well either way
yeah
either way is fine by me as long as the two wo things um tie up
as far as i'm concerned it doesn't really matter whether those are in or out
we wouldn't you think that if we just write the programme the way that even in the p way that it displays everything it still leaves those out
like if we those a special information density i. d. or if you just put a spe yeah something like that
no minus one or something
and then just make sure that summary even in the in the most summarised mode just never puts them in
yeah certainly possible
it might be a problem for me at the stage right now because i based everything on not having those um
hmm
actually yeah 'cause the t. f. i. d. f. wouldn't make any sense with
yeah it's a cer uh
yeah
yeah my topic segmenter doesn't like blank lines either
uh what i also
so maybe we should just omit them then
yeah what i also did was having two people um annotate the first meeting
and so they didn't annotate the n n uh uh the spaces and everything would mess up
mm
i think if i had spaces for the um new values so when i went to do correlation it wouldn't work anymore
so i don't know
okay so maybe we should leave them out then
'kay shall we take a quick look at the current sys
oh okay s
oh what i could do is um work um further with um what i've got now and then just when i have my um um yeah
the final formula ready i could uh t apply to the new stuff
that would be okay
so um by how did you assign the dialogue act number
did you take the one you found in the in the um x. m. l. file and just know put it there
um
or did you
no my um yeah what my um t. f. i. d. f. is based on colin's data
sorry
so
um i end up with the same
oh it's the bar is working now
okay
okay you end up with
yeah
yeah it is actually
okay
it is it is jumping now
oh yeah cool
sorry
yeah another uh sh issue was that
oh so the summary is probably okay 'cause it does the job
yeah it did s it did summarise just now
it's just it's summarising stupidly but at least it's jumping
yeah
is it still the old old t. f. i. d. f.
shall
yes and in fact at the moment i don't even know which of the two i'm summarising over
oh okay
do you know y are w are we um so at the moment the configuration is that word importance file is test three and t. d. i. d. f. file is test two
oh i can't remember which one it is at the moment
hmm
yep that that those names are mislead well the t. f. i. d. f. is fine but word importance is completely misleading it's not word importance at all
i've just i've just switched them around
so i have no clue what we're actually doing at the moment
yeah especially since i've just especially s since i've just switched them around anyway
but that's okay
i by the way i read a paper which makes an important point about combining two things of that type
um that's basically it's it's t going on about this fancy called geometric mean which effectively just means multiplying them
but i i have some good f information about different ways how you can sort of weight two different factors
because it's uh like it it's for something very similar
somebody would try to solve a very similar problem where they also had two factors sort of and they want to weigh them together
mm-hmm
and there is like a good justifiable reason um why we should do in a certain way and how we can then with a simple parameter adjust how much one weighs and how much the other weighs
so there is something for just for putting them together in a relatively simple way but still a way that we can sort of justify
mm-hmm
um and we can quote stuff on that
is it very complex or is it r oh just multiplying together
yeah sure we hmm
no it's multiplying them and and like putting them one over the power of something and the other over minus one one minus the power of something
to a power
yeah
i've seen that before
and that's sort of and they they've plotted some graphs about like where they show f like one going from zero to the one and the other going zero to one and like how the how the landscape changes and how i the parameter changes
yeah
how it works
so it's quite good
yeah i've seen that before actually
um so that's probably seeing that we're probably not gonna go into any whatever base blah blah blah markov model blah blah blah about f combining them
no
um that's probably what we go at
hmm
now this is still not ideal at the moment dave
it's it's sort of it's overrunning the f like it so okay so at the moment we're that far that if i now click onto a segment hits
yeah
ah it's still working like it should do
hmm
yeah it's just wait sorry i just re sized it a bit
who has that going
yeah so it's j like the values are sort of hard coded for the screen sizes in dice and my screen's smaller
so let's see i was a stupid user and was clicking on this segment
we probably have to make the segment lines a lot bigger
so then i h i did i get a new summarisation
yeah i didn't actually see
so let me check a different one
yeah
yeah so you see it's a different text
and you see it it's running through it
so it did work
and also you see the indicator in where we are is jumping
yeah
so it's it's skipping stuff
now i don't think the summary at the moment is what we wanted to be seeing the words like oh and mm and exactly exactly right sure
oh yeah
mm
yeah that that is ancient data though
so
this seems probably sh this is again probably the opposite of what we want
so it's probably some value that you have to like divide by one uh one divide by the value of something
but
having said that it's picking out some interesting stuff
like we're looking at atlas you'd expect to score quite high
yes but also every other word in that sentence we should look at are probably in your list of fifty like list of all important words in the universe
yeah maybe but atlas you'd have thought it'd be quite high
so yes but it's probably just because if you look at the other one
like this is just their best sentence for like having function words in a row sort of and every o other i mean this one is sort of the developing a big infrastructure
huh
so maybe it's just doing it randomly at the moment
i don't know
but we have some summary working and that's a good basis to start from
if i promise now that you'll get something where you can put your own data and that's sort of ringing a bit hollow
i'm just quite surprised it all actually worked because i've been working it we've been working on like incomplete versions that haven't worked for a long time
and like to see it all come together
yeah
hmm
yeah uh still it's uh it it's might be having some problem
i think this one over ran just before
so we might still have some problem here that it's not stopping at the end but so dave
can you make the promise even i'm not making the promise realistically that the girls will very soon get
yeah i'll do the first thing i'll do is make a load box for selecting a file
okay yeah
and a script that sets the class path so it can be run with just a script
yeah
so p class path is like this long
s
s so at the moment i've hard coded it to just um taking one tenth of the number of utterances which were in the original selection
but we'll have parameter for that
yeah
yeah
it actually it gives you an error if you put it to twenty because there's some things in there which are shorter than twenty
and twenty
and if you select those than it's having an
yeah we need to add some sanity checking in some of the stuff
yeah
but i think like a b a proportional one is probably not bad idea
that's bl i mean an an absolute length is sort of a bit strange because that means that some utterances will not be changed in length
i know but we had that discussion before and i'm confused myself about what i think about it
yeah
so the fact that this is going on beyond that green line here is something that's not ideal but that's something we have to sort out
but this is working in general
does anyone have a general overview over the whole time issue like as in what date is it today
what date do we have to have this presented what day of the week is that and issues like that
hmm
so the presentation is now sh two weeks from today
presentation is exactly in two weeks
yeah
'kay
one week from today i shall hear the freedom ring from the hills and and everything and shall then throw myself into new slavery
um uh and re i think we should start to think about evaluation by now
i mean if you want to have some people
but we don't we don't need it evaluated for the presentation do we
yeah but it's just uh three days between the presentation and the yeah
but yeah
is it
oh 'cause it was moved back wasn't it
ah
yeah
yeah
hmm
no really
so yeah i don't know if we're gon
yeah
and the report
yeah
i can rope people in to to doing it a few people at least
do you think we're gonna have time
yeah i think we should ha take the time because i think it will be
as long as we design it as long as we design it before hand uh i think we can probably manage to actually do it in the three days after
is it not is it not only two days anyway
you're talking about the user evaluation
but we'll also have to write the the thing in that time
writing the report won't be so bad
how long is it expected to be
i don't know
but it's fifty percent of the mark
i know but uh if everyone like if everyone is managing three pages for their bit then that's gonna be that that's a big report then
no
and stuff
so yeah but evaluation
ah
we should probably write some user documentation 'cause i bet that will get us marks
yeah
you think
yeah they'd love that kind of stuff
yeah
i think so too
we should probably inquire about that or like integrate tool tips that would be visible
just we'll just write you know little help files or something
yeah
yeah that'd probably be quite good
yeah i've got a basic search working now
have you java doc ed it
it's g it's got a user interface
so yeah
no
and also where is it
uh i'm still in my directory but i i can put it in your directory
okay 'cause the code version in the group directory is not the right one
yeah yeah i've i've not been using that
yeah
yeah
yeah i've just been taking the the class files from your directory
okay
having said that dave we could probably w like if we want
we could probably go back to the c um to the group directory and just use this trick
it really seems to be all about starting in the directory
in directory yeah
but i mean if if the two of us are just working on it it doesn't make a difference 'cause i've already mounted your directory now
so and probably
okay
well we should wait till we have it ready for um you guys to use
then we'll put it back in the group directory
mm
so i'll try and do that today
'cause i've got time today
and as long as i don't run into problems i don't see it taking too long
how about the summarisation again you wanted to base it on sentence length as well
and i've got a sentence length incorporated into my importance measure at the moment
so
well in that case it it's probably just i mean that's probably fine
i mean
okay
but if we do it twice it wouldn't make too much sense
yeah
yeah it would buy us something
don't know how exactly we will want to implement your
i'm not sure how much should be done in the programme because uh
i don't know
i think it should probably be done off line
what
the basic uh combining of all the factors
well if it's just multiplying to numbers
it can be done in the programme 'cause then we can um because what we could do is have a slide bar where we can adjust this value
yeah yeah sure
actually if you can figure out a way like how basically a general way because there's at least two points at which we are interested in that
how we can just have a slide bar which we can read and write to which is in a frame of that type
that would be good
it shouldn't be difficult should it
i mean should just be
hopefully we can take over that right one 'cause we don't need it
that'd be quite nice
yeah but it might be more diffi uh let's see it you could if you're lucky
you probably have just to extend that class and then you can work with that value
but if you're unlucky it might be quicker to just write a very simple string component which is just the s just a bar
i bet you can just uh just add it to the um panel
like what i bet that's a pre made swing component that little slider and all you do is add it to a panel
yeah yeah yeah
so because we'd basically it would be good to have two different ones to play around with
one for controlling the length of the summary and another one for
um for the merging factor if we do it that way with the chi metric
yeah
can you send me a link to that paper so that i'll implement that in summarizer
yeah yeah
it's it's just a single formula effectively yeah
um how is the audio thing going
is that you've probably not had time to work on that
oh no i've not looked at it
yeah like last week i just not done anything
but can't see it taking long again
'kay it seems that at the moment a lot of the stuff that has to be done at sort of at the moment i'm saying oh dave
can you do that
so that's not ideal
but to be honest i did like nothing really on it last week
so and i've got time today tomorrow and probably friday
oh
okay
so
'cause i think i mean the audio is a v in the end the audio is a very important component of it
mm-hmm
just because it's it's gonna look stupid if we have everything working but just if
it's just annoying because i need to do that on a dice machine
so i can't get them to compile under windows
the speech tools
yeah
and um most the dice machines don't have working sound cards
so
hmm
is there any way for x. forwarding sound
no idea
'cause that would be sort of the nice way to sit at home and have it forward the sound at the lowest bit rate to you
yeah
i mean seeing that it's over broad band it's forwarding the graphics quite okay it would probably like broad band wise band width wise probably work out
i'm not sure how it if it if it can do sound or not
i've no idea
but it's probably not and uh not a simple thing
but like what i can do is um
i i'm pretty confident that it'll just be writing a script and it will just go
and as long as i can test the script like once and it's working fine i can just make it return dummy stuff so it works on other machines
hmm
y are you not creating files anywhere like sort of real files
yes
so
so that you can do on a dice machine independent of w
oh actually i know what i can do
i can then
i can change the script
so if i'm using my one at home
i can just add s. s. h. stuff in to ev evoke the sound tools on the uh on dice and then copy 'em back
yeah
one problem with s. s. h. ing in general is that the machine that like on the only gateway machines they hate you for doing anything on them
yeah
and there's no simple way at least i haven't found one to directly in in a single step sort of s. s. h. and then s. s. h. again
hmm
well actually i guess if you put s. s. h. and you know c you can give a command outright after with s. s. h.
so if that c command is s. s. h. again and if you that would require that you have all your key files set correctly
yeah
which i haven't because it always fucks up on my system
maybe if you get that working then you should be able to directly go into another machine
i'm sure i can figure out some way to do it anyway
uh
yeah
if it comes to it i'll just um install netbeans and stuff on my linux machine and work on that
yeah
'cause a p a primitive version of the sound to have relatively soon would be good
i think
well that to be honest there won't be a primitive in between stage
ok okay
just it'll just work hopefully
okay
okay
okay
in theory at least anyway
hmm
okay good
so to come back to the problem we had before
so the reason why the summary didn't work well in the last one and works well now is because based on the bottom data the data is so homogeneously high in its imp importance rating that it just sort of then
everything else being equal it took the first ones more or less
but now it's working better because now it's on a much more evenly distributed
i wonder if we should um do something like dropping the bottom third
then re mapping the lowest remaining one to zero and scaling it like that 'cause you get a much nicer distribution like that
well
the most professional way of doing it would be to map them according to the standard deviation 'cause that way it au would automatically always that's sort of like it it's the problem is it's more calculation expensive and slightly more complicated even though it's actually like in terms of calculation it's not much heavier
but like you know generally about standard deviation
um i've not used it to do that before but
yeah it's it's a g it's a very simple simple formu it's basically just whatever the average of r mean square differences from the mean or something
yeah
which the problem with it is that generally you first have to get the mean and only t only once you have the mean you know what
there is a way of calculating it um yeah well calculating it cumulatively but i can't remember it
in one go
yeah i've derived that i've derived that myself
like i didn't find it so i did it myself and it took me a day with the formula
yeah
but then i'm slow at maths
so the the good thing about that would be that if you simply say that whatever
one standard deviation below the mean is zero and one standard deviation above the mean is one or two standard deviations or something
then whatever the data is like it would always normalise
yeah that's probably quite a good idea
yeah it's it's not the simplest
but that like that's the most professional way i can think about it
y that would indirectly also drop stuff
i mean that would drop whatever is below or above
yeah
yeah that's probably quite sensible
so if you find that formula that would be good
otherwise i can see if i can still understand like i did it in my programme
it's uh it's really stupid
like the standard standard deviation formula just requires you to have the mean initially
and that makes some things exactly twice as computationally expensive and there is a way of doing it cumula cumulatively
yeah i can't remember it off hand but i know there is one
hmm
so yeah so that's one possible way of doing that
so the
but it could be it could be fine i mean running over the data twice probably is okay
and that's just in the loading stage right
yeah that should actually be fine especially in the worst case we just introduce a small hour glass
yeah
yeah
but anyway we only we only gonna present this once and we can probably just like sort of start it up before the presentation starts
so if we shouldn't at all be worried about it's actually it's quite beautiful
mm
it's like if you b want a programme only to run once and only a part of it
you don't worry if it crashes afterwards if it wastes all the resources if it formats the hard disk in the end
anyway i'm rambling on
um
yeah never closes the process when he does it now
d
no it does not it does not if y i changed it
hmm
i just
they used to not um close the process when you click the cross
so you would forget that that means that you would start it fifteen times over and have fifteen zombies running
um
does anyone know anything about which dice machines have sound cards and how to find them
no
'cause the thing is we can like this at the moment wor is working because it has a sound card
the interesting thing is that because it's structure of this it isn't enough to just say well if you don't have a sound card you don't have sound
at least i think that's what i remember our problem was that
yeah it refuses to r load the clock for some reason
yeah
no
mm-hmm
so i've worked around that there is ways i think to get around it but the problem is
i don't know why
so you b you basically we have to we have to have two code versions then
one for sound card and one for non sound card machines to test it on
um because it you have to change all sorts of other things if you don't have a sound card
so there isn't a simple way to just tell which ones the sound card machines are and just to use sound card machines is there
uh that really yeah that makes it really quite difficult for us if we want to test our stuff the first have to fight for our computers without cards
we
no but i guess i mean if you just if you trust in dave's summary for the audio
just putting all these things into sound then then having a written summary
yeah sure
i mean i yeah yeah i i just care for the written one
yeah you still you st yeah you still get the written one and the display
does that work without the sound cards
yeah yeah
so the yeah
the only thing you don't get is the clock
okay
yeah
so i think dave really the easiest way is if you just make a sound card and a non sound card version of it
okay yeah
because
i don't think we should bother 'cause we'll run it on a sound card version
yeah but then that means that the girls can't test it
that's the problem
like
th yes they can
we can
all that happens is it refuses to load load the clock
you still get the display in the summary
yes but without the clock you don't have well actually you're right it doesn't like f it doesn't strictly have to do any movement in it yeah
so the yeah the move uh but you can still click on the segments and that'll still work won't it
yeah but we have to comment stuff out for that i think
like at the moment if you click on a segment it automatically sets the whole clock thing going and stuff
so we have to comment out stuff
so that's what i'm saying that there is we could make it that a flag couldn't we
okay
we could just make that uh like a run time flag and then make a few ifs and say if
yeah
um oh there must be a way of detecting whether the clock's loaded
like in fact there there is
yes the p there is
you can try and set something on the clock and use try and catch and then if you catch the exceptions set the flag
yeah
yeah
so anyway so that's something we should probably do in one way or another because it seems just that the overwhelming majority of dice machines don't have sound card
hmm
hmm
okay do you want to have a look at the agreement and disagreement data that i worked on last week
or do we have anything more on this
no nothing c much to talk about this
so apart from like uh a search box and the similarity thing f once that kicks off
w which is gonna be horrible but um this is more or less in the end
like this is very similar to what our product will look like in the end
hmm
seeing that realistically with the given time frame we're not gonna do amazing new things from now on
yeah
so i mean we'll hopefully be able t
m perhaps my list of agreements
huh
perhaps my list of agreements somewhere
list of agreements
yeah if we find them good enough
we could put those on display
okay yeah
we wanted to provide um that in an extra list saying probably agreement
okay
instead of a list what about putting it in the display
uh yeah i think it would be good dave's right
it could be good in the display to annotate them in the display if we can
yeah for example
yeah
yeah we could just make
can you click on a point in time in display and jump to there yet
not just yet
but that should that's actually that's probably the only i can say i can do this week because that should be i mean i'll do it in an inefficient way
okay
'cause that'd be pretty good
i'll effectively sort of go through all the segments and check if they're clicked on
but i think dave what we should do is that th uh the time click of the clock i think that's changeable
and i think we should probably increase that
because at the moment it's zero point one seconds and that's just there is actually there are some background noise when it's working and i think that is because it's like doing so much every time
no i don't get that on my machine
yeah it's probably because you d i'm not sure if you have the version where the display yet
where the display is actually updating up here when it's moving on
no i don't
no
so i mean yes it is because my display is programmed inefficiently
but i think with the t given time constraints it's probably easier instead of making a very efficient display code to just make the time make the clock whatever
okay
zero point five seconds or something
do you want the monitor
mm-hmm
as long as you can skip more accurately than the time steps that's fine
'cause otherwise you might risk cutting bits off
if i can skip more accurately then
like if you want to jump to a point you need to be able to jump more accurately than half second
by half second you'll miss words
uh you're
are we still with that idea that we want to display bars for the individual speakers
yeah i think so
okay
and also displaying the speakers before an utterance
hmm
it's a bit small but i don't know why that is
okay
oh yeah i can yeah i can do that
hmm
strange
that's probably because it's coming from my resolution and it's you have a much higher resolution
so
yeah perhaps p because it's wide screen or something
yeah
but um okay what you see here um in this part is uh
no mouse yeah
there it is yeah
here is um a list of the uh um most important or yeah most probable words that occur in agreement
um so the number in the first brackets is um so i run it on all the b. e. d. b. m. r. and b. r. o. meetings to learn it
um so uh the number in the first brackets is how often it occurred in the um utterances that were annotated as agreements by the uh dialogue act agreement
um and the number in the second brackets is how much it occurred in the rest
and um the first number in every line is um how much more often that is per same um same text length
so um the num uh the words that uh it gives it are look quite good i think
it's um yeah exciting perfect true interesting exactly correct super and so on
um and then i ran it on the first meeting getting um the so what's in the in the brackets in this window here is the utterances
um and the moment it can't make any differences betwe i mean you get the same value for every utterance that is exactly or every utterance that is sure
and um for the longer utterances i just um look how often um one of these words is in there and simply add it up
so that should in principle favour longer utterances
um and yeah and so these numbers here um one or zero these here um that's um
um the dialogue act labels whether it's um um if they're annotated as agreement they're not zero here
so here um for those who get a v that get a very high score
um they're mostly no not zero and some of those who are zero are o are still very good
like i i definitely agree um it's a nice kind of agreement that we probably want to have
um and when you get further down yeah you see those with very low prob um score also have um no agreements
here they are
a lot of zeros
again i think that's probably a good part if we had a slide b um bar initially where we could dynamically adapt the threshold of what we yeah
of what we display yeah
so maybe it's just like maybe b it's just good to have like some generic component with three slide bars or something where we can relatively easily add a fourth one or something
yeah
you know and just like sort of all our fiddle factors
yeah
um because
obviously we'll hide that in the presentation
uh well it depends we we could like in some cases we could put it as a feature and say you know you can dynamically
yeah
but we don't want i don't think we want to have exposed to the user doing things like adding the threshold of which agreements we display
like
we wouldn't call it threshold we would sort of like the granularity of decision or something like it
hmm
decision
so and yeah and every and everything above that threshold i could then add the utterance where it occurs
just put a certain graphical item like a handshake or something cool
yeah
yeah
yeah they uh that does look quite promising doesn't it
yeah right
right
so it looks quite good i think
hmm
um so that's what i got for agreement
then for disagreement i did also but um it's a bit more difficult because there's so little disagreement
mm
yeah so there you s again see the list
but it's much shorter and it's mu much worse
so you can have happy faces and angry faces
yes i was j it i was just thinking the same like it's it's so tempting
smilies
like we we'll we'll have yellow we'll have yellow smilies and yellow angry faces
um that is um here at the list of utterances it um gets us for the first meeting
ah beautiful
didn't somebody say that actually like a lot of agreements have have actual words which should suggest disagreement like
yeah i mean i think perhaps that's why we have but uh rated so high here
yeah yeah
that makes sense
so can you um
or think
i think
uh yeah
yeah
think is also rated higher in the non agreement than in the agreement
yeah
i mean there is some funny things
so will that produce basically an agreement and a disagreement score for every dialogue act
um yes
yeah that's effectively what i'm getting here
so could you put them in the same format as the other data
yeah it's just i mean it's it's exactly this thing but just i would i would just have to re scale this factor here
and i'll make us t to read it in
and i mean this is the dialogue act number
so
oh right okay
so i could probably i could probably read it from uh that file already
yeah i can just give it to you in the format you want
so it w it will just k
my preferred would be dialogue act number then you can put both the scores in one file
and then score yeah it this was just for showing it
huh
you can put both the scores in one file if it makes it easier
if they're corresponding ea for each thing yeah they should be right
yeah
so for each utterance you have one agreement and one disagreement score
agreement and one disagreement
yeah
uh something like it
okay
so i'll read that into um i'll make it part of the get measure thing
so you can just get it with a flag
using get measure
okay yeah
the one where we current
so you know how zero is t. f. i. d. f.
one is um the well i've called it word importance but that's a really m misleading name
yeah
yeah
yeah
you know what if you can if you introduce um like a sort of a static what's it called public static int
so basically a constant like that's java's type of a constant and give them names like so zero t. d. i. d. f.
one that probably makes the code a lot more readable for everybody who's playing around with it
yeah probably
you know you know what i mean
mm-hmm
so just like whatever three means agreement value and then i'd just write something agreement
and then it's easier to understand for both of us what's going on
yeah okay
um one problem i used to have is with all the yeahs
because i mean obviously they all write it the same
so um i was thinking perhaps at looking um at the um acoustic measures i have
so for example at my f. zero um deviation
hmm
but um yeah
by now i just had a look at the yeah data um and actually the average f. zero deviation is only slightly higher for the positive ones than for the negative ones
i mean there is a p difference but it's probably not significant enough to really make use of it
but i perhaps investigate some time still to
i would also th yeah but i would also th
uh the problem is yeah is occurring not only as an agreement but really frequently as like uh an encouragement as well isn't it
yeah
yeah
so and i th my my hypothesis was that if it's really yeah uh like agreement
yeah
it will sound different than if it than into if it is just a back channel
yeah
but you know what i think we should put the threshold for that one in the end quite high anyway
mm
so probably it doesn't make much of a difference
because i think this thing
but that has nothing to do with the threshold
no but like
because you have uh you have um you don't have it only with yeahs
you have it also with words that are much higher ranked
you have the same problem like for example with yep is much higher ranked because it occurs less often um in the training thing
but i mean the fact that different ones have the same number in itself isn't a problem is it
no
um it's only if they're used in different contexts
so if if for every yep you'd be sure that it's an agreement than that wouldn't be a problem
so you're saying that you're not sure if every yep is an agreement or
yes i b yeah i know that not every yep is an agreement
because y um this right yep and okay things are typically also back channels
hmm
how what's the highest um ranked one that that kind of problem occurs with
'cause if it's below about 'cause i saw there's ones up in the eighties wasn't there
if it's below like fifty it's probably or exactly no they're all but one
yeah but we would throw a lot away that are quite good
'cause we on the display we probably take quite high
if you if you would set it off
so it'd only matter if it occurs on ones that are really highly ranked
so over over how many different over which length is this
now this is like so the third column is the utterance where it occurs right
yes
okay so w i think we really do have to put the threshold quite quite high then because
yeah
well otherwise you'd get icons all over the place
yes 'cause it i was just i was just checking you know like how far apart are they
so anyway
mm-hmm
and at the moment that's definitely not a good thing to display if they're like an average ten ten utterances apart or something
yeah
yeah
so we want probably want to take a threshold at least of fifty or sixty just as a looking at that
i think for this meeting um there were um what was it like ar around si or ninety annotated agreements or yeah ag agreement dialogue acts
mm-hmm
mm-hmm
to we probably won't want to display ninety
so
we'd want to rate them as how important they were wouldn't we
i mean the b the best ones are definitely those on the first screen here
yeah
so it could just
again
i'd say probably a good way of going about that question is to have a control which we can vary in the dis and then just sort of because that's in the end how it's gonna be evaluated
yeah and see how it turns out
you know in the end it this is gonna li i mean we're gonna present it and say yeah so this our it shows disagreements
and then we see what what looks good and what looks i think probably it looks credible if like an u if every sort of every topic segment has um w yeah
an agreement at the end
mm-hmm
yeah okay
or like or like something in between the three and and five agreements but not more
or probably maybe less but not much less and actually the i think there doesn't have to be one in everything
yeah
probably have to plot them 'cause some of them are also i mean this is just added by different speakers for example
they are immediately following one another
but it's just two speakers agreeing i think
same for this one here for these two here
so yeah we'd probably want to merge ones that were very close into one
i mean they they will be optically merged anyway
yeah
n yes but maybe in an expensive way or maybe in a stupid looking way though
yeah
um
yeah and we should probably make some logic when it displays it that says if there's ones very close together it just centres it among the
yeah d i'm yeah i was just thinking that it can act it can probably be done on display level
yeah okay
that was just what i
yeah it's looking quite good though
this one crashed
mine just crashed i think which is bad
it probably just it kept on playing and now reached some whatever
i think it's always really funny that when you look at people's computers who don't use the computer much
their desktop's really tidy and when you work with people who use it all the time there's stuff everywhere
i onl only keep uh the stuff i actually need on it and then i clean it up every you know every
so mine's like that as well
yeah
my god
but actually this all here is n. l. s. s. d. because it was data a. that didn't fit on my um quota anymore
okay
so toby you wanted to uh have keywords for each topic segment or something
yeah
um who would uh who uh provides the values for that
no one yet
yeah
no one
i think sort of the bottom line and which might well end up what it's gonna be like is that we take the single highest ranked utterance and put that as a t as a title
right
yeah
like realistically looking at this from the the time we have left to do this and stuff
because what i do is um having um values for each segment at the moment
so i could just extract the highest ones for each segment
yeah that
i don't know if that's good or bad
there w
it could be at least i could provide some value
that could be good yeah
yeah
yeah maybe even on a s on a sing like i is that on a r like is that on a word basis would that be single words
or would that be
uh it it doesn't matter to me
'cause be check out what they would be like on a word basis
i could do both
okay
maybe actually if it if there's one word which is very typical i mean it's probably some word like uh
because that's like the only time that uh was spelled with three a. and stuff
i think that actually that might be a problem of the whole um annotation that if they aren't exactly consistent in how they descri uh transcribe stuff like that
mm
yeah same thing uh um with the yoohoos and so on
then we probably can't yeah
'cause that's when we're thinking sometimes like why is mm high
but then probably it's the only time that mm was spelled with a dot at the end and stuff
mm
so but yeah like if if single w
maybe we should um download a dictionary and check our utterances before we uh listen to make sure that they're actually real words
i c i have dictionaries
do you see what i mean
if it's just like i have arbitrarily long lists from the british national corpus of when t usually
that do not include mm
well let's say at least they do it uh consistently enough that i think you can filter them out fairly well
hmm
yeah i mean see how it turns out
if they look good then that's a good way of doing it as any i suppose
yeah
yeah so if you if like i mean if the single ha best one word for a for a segment is interesting that would be really good
hmm
seem to be having
actually what i think you should do is take the highest three or four and then just merge them together into one utterance
use a random s
it wouldn't make any sense but it'd give you an idea of what they're actually talking about if you see what i mean
yeah
'kay we're going backwards here now it suddenly crashes and hangs
especially when the segments are really long
yeah
yeah i mean that was that was sort of in the original of then the nice fancy drawings that we gave steven
i mean that was part of it that sort of within the segment you had these sub segments and each of them had different words and whatever happened to our dreams
uh
yeah i don't think we're gonna have time for that
are there assignments
no i don't think we have
which is a shame 'cause it would've been cool
yeah
hmm
yeah are we gonna have time to make it display like a whole archive of meetings
or is it just gonna be displaying single meetings and you'll hold up different ones
um at the moment it doesn't really care how many meetings it's displaying
hmm
poor man's solution is probably gonna be to have a a list
just draw a big black line on the borders i think
hmm
oh so j you you are think of loading them all at once
well y you you can if you want to
yeah
it's
yeah
'cause it ju it can display from any utterance to any other utterance
it doesn't really
yeah the see at the moment the dialogue i. d. s just they start at zero for each meeting they don't run um continuously
yeah
do they
ah
but you w you'd like them to run continuously
yeah i'd prefer them drawn continuously
yeah
yeah i can change that
okay then you you will provide a file with all the mappings from the old ones to the
even though we
yeah just to change the index files as well
'kay
okay
because that way all we have to do to display ea more than one meeting is have a harder boundary drawn
unique ones
yeah
yeah i think that like the dr the drawing has to be changed anyway the it's not ideal at the moment
um yeah so if performance wise it generally works fine for the display it shouldn't make much of a difference
'cause i think everything in the display code is just from the first until the last one displayed
so if if the other performance is okay then we should really just load the whole thing in
i'm very dis
one thing we will have to do is we want we'd really want a different behaviour if we clicked on a whole meeting than a segment
so if there's more than one meeting displayed
it should um if you click even on one the segments of that meeting i think it should re initialize and display that just that meeting
so i'm not su i'm not sure how easy that would be to do
see that probably just means that the display sort of has an internal knowledge about what level of zoom it has
so initially the display
it just needs to know whether it's displaying more than one whole meeting doesn't it
that's the only
knowledge it would need
yes
yeah
but anyway we can sort that out if we have time once we've got everything else
yeah
that's probably fairly simple to do actually if we do it in that most primitive way of just saying as long as you display more than one meeting
yeah
that'll get s s sufficient to claim that we had implemented some kind of zoom as well
yeah
we then need some way of getting back up again in the hierarchy
but that in the worst case it will just be a static sort of arrow up button in the right hand topper corner of the display
yeah
and you press that and then you're on the display the whole thing again
mm
but for that at the moment my display code needs that thing to work the one oh no that's working at the moment anyway
the one that i just say give me one hundred values over that length and then you're internally okay
yeah it's not done the very clever way but it does work
but yeah but uh that's okay as long as my display i was just thinking my display can't handle displaying a million different segments
but now r no but it doesn't have to
mm-hmm
even now it doesn't have to
okay well that's all details
um so dave can you just turn this what we have right now in
basically do a code for ease on it
do you want me to put a search in soon
um i'll probably tonight just work on getting a frozen version that works consistently
no oh yeah
yeah
and um if you could document it for me that's probably enough for me to add it in
make
unless you want to do it
yes
uh and if an
yeah well we'll work on it yeah
but my code i've not documented the programme manager class
so though it's a bit hairy at the moment isn't it
if anyone feels that they have free time uh this is a joke
uh-huh
um one thing that would be convenient for all sorts of things and which i haven't found out about it is how to do tool tips in an arbitrary way in in in swing graphic displays
now there is simple ways of doing tool tips over a given element like if you have a button and you just give it a tool tip text
but there is means of doing tool tips that just i c i put my mouse over
let's say i put my mouse over this line here and then it would tell me something about what it is
hmm
and that would be quite convenient for a lot of things because then we can sort of have a lot of information in the display in the in the way that just when the mouse is over it
mm-hmm yes
but i haven't figured out how it works and that's something that probably so if everyone is ever bored or anyone feels that they can do that
okay so probably what you'd want to do is um
detect where the mouse is and change the default tool tip for that component
yes but
because it automatically displays at the correct position when you hover
yeah but the the thing is it it isn't simply an act of setting a string default tool tip
there seems to be something about a tool tip object that you have to create and give it all sorts of different properties and stuff or
yeah you might nor really want to be creating a new one every time you move the mouse
yeah
so anyway i haven't looked much into that
so if if anybody looks into that then let me know
otherwise i'll start looking into it as soon as i have time again
but if anybody
i'll have a look through some of my java books 'cause it might be the sort of thing they have in there
yeah
i found some stuff about it on the web and it just looked to me like proper coding
like i saw half page code samples which effectively just displayed a tool tip and i didn't have the time at that point to get deeper into that
mm
so if anybody gets any good samples of that never
anyways that is that it for now
yeah
is there all is that g version all in the
no but i'm gonna i'm going up appleton tower now and i have my external hard disk
okay
so i can
cool
so i'll start working on that in like half an hour or something and it will be the
yeah
okay
is there any dice machines in this building
mm-hmm
freely accessible for me
mm
can you show me where because i'm actually not going to appleton tower at the moment
yeah
so then i don't have to go up and down
actually no but i have to go there anyway and put a piece of paper on two machines where some stuff of mine is running on
yeah and i think like i'll just i'll just kick in full time for n. l. s. s. d. next week 'cause there's nothing i have to do then
apart from cognitive modelling which i think i'll just do in five hours three hours
you take a look at that
hmm
yeah but not too detailed
so
hmm
i might just not go for the last question because usually the last question is takes half the time and gives you five percent or something like okay
yes we're gonna talk about the evaluation next week
we really need to get in contact with the other group and see if they want to do a joint evaluation
yeah we could do that
so you need to get their email addresses
yeah i think they're on the n. l. s. s. d. web page
are they
hmm
really
at least their names and if we have their names then we can get their email
that'd be handy
yeah we can get them
okay
so you do is sending them an email
'cause i was hoping that steve would mention it ian 'cause we've mentioned it to him so many times
mm
but he obviously hasn't
no maybe he has mentioned it to them but they just never talked to us
i mean we didn't talk to them
yeah
so
it's sort of coming as a shock to me now because i was sort of in this mindset
like i first knew oh there's a lot of time between the presentation and the report
and then i knew oh now the presentation is shifted
but the correlation between those two facts the interdependencies there's some fancy planning language about that
but that
s there's the frame problem
yes it's um it's probably some version of the frame problem
frame plob problem
hasn't been clear to me
no i think it's coming together not bad at the moment actually
yeah
um by the way how long um how much time do we have for the presentation
don't know
yeah probably as long as we need
yeah
but yeah i don't know
yeah but more like twenty minutes or more like an hour
half an hour or some
well i reckon that it
i can't see it going on for an hour to be honest
yeah half an hour probably
i reckon that probab
yeah i mean if you if you if you present the components of what it it's based on
then you will need more than twenty minutes to present it i guess
but if you just present the functionality of the thing if you're not like i don't think this presentation is about the internal working
it's question
yeah then
so yeah
yeah i thought it was a demo basically
hmm
so for a demo i think realistically since everything in this university sort of works in one hour slots and stuff
yeah i think
so if it's two groups then it probably it's gonna be roughly half an hour ish
half an hour
yeah
and like ten minutes of that would be probably set up time as well
hmm
ten minutes of that will probably be set up time as well
no why is th this is gonna be so bad
like there's gonna be some small l
i we maybe you should present it on your laptop 'cause we can be really sure it's running before we come
yeah but the performance is really bad at the moment on that one though
hmm
plus we would have to get the speech tools running on my laptop then wouldn't we
i could probably get my computer in if i could get someone to give me a lift
mm
i know a couple of people with cars
yeah it may be a good idea to do that
well let's let's see
did it it could just be fluent on the laptop for all i know
could we guarantee that it'd work
i mean like at the moment it's not too bad apart from i think the sound is stuttering and that's b i think because of the laptop
but we can only really judge that once we have sound files
yeah 'cause i wouldn't need to bring a monitor or anything i'll just need to bring the box
hmm
i'm pretty sure i could nick a lift off someone
how fast is yours vera
my computer
uh it doesn't have linu linux
mm-hmm
so
well net would run on anything
but
or j. builder
yes
in fact you won't even you shouldn't even need either as long as you got java installed
no that's true
yeah i've been able to run it without yeah
yeah that's true
yeah
virtual machine should be fine
but but but that all relies on finding some way of getting the speech tools to do their job
oh crap i forgot about that
yeah see that's 'cause that's the thing like that would rely on i just don't think it's a good idea to run the speech tools in
cygwin maybe
hmm
in cygwin
mm-hmm
no but cygwin should run um the java as well
no no no no d wherever this is going it doesn't sound good
um
we can he can use my laptop as sort of like as a as a server as a sound server
a sound server
mm
but that would still mean that we have to get the speech tools running on this
no you know i think i mean the way java works is that t
i think it'll run on on their dice machine if we're doing it in if we well we should definitely test it the day before
hopefully yeah
yeah
yeah i'm sure he'll let us uh test it out before we do it
yeah
'kay
so dave are you gonna make something primitive that people can load their data in
yep i'll do that today
and i'll yeah i'll make a script to run it and put that in the group directory
ok
and i'll send around the email when it's done
yeah
yeah
i'm not i'm not a hundred percent sure what needs to be changed to make it work with the to make it not crash if it doesn't have a sound card
there's there's quite a bit you have to comment out for that which is stupid because i
it'll be the bit where it creates the clock
or is there stuff in the display as well
yeah the yeah
no but the thing is the display calls methods which probably expect some so i think if the display itself isn't doing anything clocky
so as long as in the main pr in the programme manager everything clocky is is removed
okay
but uh i w it might be worthwhile to check how much work it would be to do it over a flag
'cause then in the end i 'cause otherwise we always have two code versions and people might be changing the wrong one
well it really we shouldn't even need a flag
you should be able to do it with exceptions
i mean that's this is kinda not exact case that exceptions are made for really
okay
okay
yeah that's true
i just i know that like if you don't do it with the exceptions crashes
that's what figured out
like if you don't have a sound card it crashes even if you don't use sound
yeah
yeah okay cool
yeah dave see in the programme manager do you have a a method to like set the current i. d. so it'll update the display
mm-hmm
'cause that's what i'm gonna need when i'm uh like getting search results
oh no it's gonna have to do something a bit more complicated than that
what it will have to do is de register everything as time handlers and then update and then re register them
hmm
uh i think the display has some method for it
right
i'm not actually like for the programme manager then to call
i'm not actually a hundred percent sure what it's called but the display has some method where you tell it where to start and where to end
yeah or there's gonna be something
yeah well as far as i've got at the moment i've made a results class that's got like the i. d. and the stuff
okay
have you got a component for displaying lists of matches
'cause that'd be pretty useful
yeah
yep
cool
i'm well i'm working on it
okay yeah i mean it's not it's not too hard to do
all you have to do is de register everything that's a time handler first before you add the stuff in
right
but um depends what behaviour we want
do we want when you click on a search result we definitely want that one to appear in the summary
well actually dave da dave dave dave
i yeah and it might not be there
yeah
i know i was thinking that might be a problem
okay
no sorry i've uh i was wrong i was thinking it's exactly the same thing that happens when we say set select no it does not
but actually a set selection does everything you want sort of
yeah it sets if you look at set select that's essentially what you wanna do yeah
no but set selection doesn't update the display though
because well it it doesn't tell the display which part to di which part to to display because the display has just called set selection to
does it not
hmm
yeah but it w it doesn't matter because um if it's jumped to in the end text area
if
then your display would the the line'll jump won't it
yeah but that only works that at the moment isn't done through our system that's just done because then the time changes
so actually a time change would automatically put the position of the display in the right play
yeah
uh no but that's not a good idea because that could well be outside the displayed area then
uh and also the real time and play time stuff would change
yeah
so
so we yeah we need to re initialize the display then don't we
yeah
no i think the display has a method for that ready which is called
anyway the display has something useful for that
something which probably starts with the word set
yeah you can set the window start utterance and window end utterance
okay
hmm
but yeah we need to do something to ensure that the search result is in the summary that's created
yeah
so may we probably want a different summary constructor that takes an an additional argument of an i. d.
and it will that w utterance will always be in the summary
hmm
alternatively there's always the method of just giving it a really high score
as a hack you know like just as long as you then don't well probably people wouldn't know
yeah i suppose
but the trouble is that still doesn't guarantee that it'll appear because if you get enough of them that are high scored it prefers the first ones it sees
hmm
well you could you could put one point one when the other ones only go up to the one
yeah i suppose
but no it's it's not it's not a nice way i'm just saying
w you could you could when it's when you're doing a search
you could just like sort of zoom back out so you got the full text for that segment or that meeting rather than a summary
'cause that's maybe what you'd want if you were a user
hmm maybe
yeah probably that actually true that if you're doing a search you're usually not interested in a condensed way but in the in the full thing anyway
yes
you could provide that option
but you could d you can um achieve the same effect
and you would otherwise it would be too complicated to cope with the thi uh system if you have to re adjust it uh to a different zoom level to get better results
yeah
probably the way to handle that would be to make a summary that's the same length as the selection and that would ensure that the search term came up
i mean it would behave strangely in the eyes of the user
hmm
mm
yeah
yeah
hmm
alright
yeah
i think proportion like i even though i'm i'm always getting myself confused about this but i think sort of making the summary length thing generally proportion
like as a as a proportional factor of of its original length is a good way of going about it
yeah
because anything with absolute length's sort of stupid because that means that a long long segment gets to one percent of its length and another one gets to exactly the same length and stuff
so if we're doing it by a proportion then just having one point zero or something makes it very easy to always end up at the actually that's what i've currently like the current code just takes a tenth of the summary length
yeah exactly
yeah
so yeah
but we'll have that slider obviously
and that's the type of slider that we can actually leave in and like show 'cause that's that's functionality
yeah 'cause that's very useful thing
yeah that's sort of like your level of the zoom
of impending doom
shall we quit here
yeah
anything to be discussed
'cause i'm gonna copy that stuff over
okay
and i'll start work in say two
will it be done by then
yeah otherwise you'll you'll definitely see me in m. s. n.
so i'll just
mm-hmm
mm-hmm
can you just remind me i don't have to tick the no n okay thing until i finish writing
but it's only if i go back to it i tick okay again
yeah
mm
yep
so if you've um if you're back to a page then you tick it again to leave it for the second time
so if i'm working o if i've done a page i'm on the second page
mm-hmm
i tick it so um i finish that page and i go back to this i can just write and then not tick until i finish writing again
yeah so it's always after n you never have to it before
yeah
fine
fine
okay
i don't believe all this stuff
it's just amazing
and you can go on both sides as well
okay
yeah right
where should we start
well i think the first thing is
what have we got
well the first thing i think is we need to uh sort out the call for abstracts or the c the call for titles
mm-hmm
because i think that's kind of overdue
mm-hmm
right
yeah
um so i volunteer to do that if you like
um uh okay
fine
yeah right
yep
so
and i'll do that
by trying to think what is it thursday today i'll d i'll do that by the end of the week anyway
so
and um you're gonna was it your idea to stick the bit in it where you say um uh
you know you're we're inviting like from quite a wide audience we give priority to linguists
mm-hmm
yeah we're gonna do that but i think we should s probably send out um separate calls okay
so we'll send one but weren't men i mean we could mention the fact that we're inviting other people
but i think it will probably just uh i mean it probably won't matter too much to the other linguists that we're having other people there
we can mention it but it's not gonna be too essential and uh we might actually just end up making them worry that
mm-hmm
you know they're gonna lose their place or whatever because uh i don't know
mm-hmm
yeah yeah
i thi separate course is good idea
that's
but we do we do have to decide a priority thing so that's something else we can look at um a little bit
later down the line
mm-hmm
so so that's the one for ling basically and i'll send that out
i'll do that today or tomorrow
um now claire that's the other thing she can deal with the psychology
um
psychology people probably that's i reckon it's the best thing to do
'cause she'll know which email address to use and and everything else
mm-hmm
mm-hmm
so um
if one of us could email claire
mm yeah
is it was that a volunteering yeah or great
okay yeah so if robert
yeah
yeah when in doubt
so i if robert emails claire and we're n gonna need to decide exactly what she's gonna say on there
um
mm-hmm
we might need to just remind her of the dates in case she doesn't know so she gets the dates right
yeah
um
and uh um she's i know she already knows that it's just anyone doing psycho linguistics basically
mm-hmm
so that's fine
and that should kinda take care of itself as well
if she just sends one round around to everyone then only the psycho linguists will say what was for me
yeah
yeah exactly
exactly
um
but then there's the rest of p. p. l. s. and i think we need to decide whether
right
but the the text for the actual call is she going to re work something or uh she should
i think she should just i think she should just write her own
mm-hmm
probably
and
i think she might be glad to see kinda there linguistics to adapt
okay
so what we'll do i mean the thing is the the main call will go out before she's got round to it anyway
that's always quite helpful
mm-hmm
so what i'll do is i'll copy it
yep
i'll c. c. her on the um
mm
i mean 'cause i can't imagine there'd be an essential difference really between the
no they won't be
i just th the only thing i'm thinking is i want to make sure that it stands out as something applicable to them
that they don't go oh we're just getting rubbish from y you know what i mean
right yeah
yeah
yeah
i want them to really know that it's addressed to them
um and the good thing about claire sending it is she's probably got a psych email address as well and it it might look a bit more relevant to them
ab
mm-hmm
not certain anyway
yeah exactly
they know her
that's that thing
they know her et cetera
um so yeah so if if we've s if i've c. c. ed the original one then you can tell her that that can be the basis for
mm-hmm
um the basis for her email but just make sure that they know it's relevant to them et cetera
mm-hmm
um and obviously in p. p. l. s. we've also got english language
now
in a way we could send out that first call to them just as part of the same email
because i think they're more likely to think it was relevant to them
i don't really know
i don't really know what you think about that
mm-hmm
but um i think we definitely should open it up to english language
um i think particularly at the moment 'cause they're really trying to sort of uh merge us into one subject area
yeah
mm-hmm
even though it should be meaningless because we're all part of a school i think that it does actually make a difference
and so i think we should invite them but then we've still got the problem of uh a priority issue
so you know probably what i was thinking is um certainly second and third years absolutely need to be uh top on top priority
mm-hmm
but then there's a kind of awkward question of where we put first years because they don't need to
if they want to should they have priority
mm
this is a kind of lower point but uh it kind of it crosses over with deciding
what we're gonna do when we uh
well do we have um a d an idea of how many people were gonna
actually have at the whole thing
any kind of because then it because seems to me it could be quite obvious
well
i don't think so
then we just subtract the number of second and third year students and then everything else is just i'd i would favour doing it just on a first come first serve basis
yeah yeah
yeah
yeah
yeah
okay
i w well let's send out the call as soon as possible see what reactions we get
and then
okay
but i mean if we're like so mean we were gonna do this thing for um i can't even remember was it two or three days
see if we have to put on some restraints
it's three days
okay
and so how many how many posters and talks are we gonna actually gonna get in
right
the uh uh they were twenty twenty minute talks with ten minute uh question time okay
let's see
mm-hmm
mm
and you can run two in a row but probably not up to three
up to three but don't exaggerate yeah
two what do you think two in a row or three in a row
if you do two in a row then that's an hour isn't it
mm-hmm
yeah
um
and then give it a twenty minute break perhaps
yeah
or
mm
i mean the thing is every time we have a break there's a question of whether we actually serve coffee and biscuits and things
yeah
because that's the kinda normal thing to do
i'm thinking if we go for say
i'm thinking uh slots of one and a half hour each
so three lectures each that would be uh three per day times three will be twenty seven
so are you saying have say three sessions in a row and then do that twice in the morning and twice in the afternoon
mm-hmm
so that'd be six hours
once in the morning twice in the afternoon
oh so just have an hour and a half in the morning
yeah
i mean or twice in the morning once in the afternoon
'cause i mean would six hours a day be pushing it
not necessarily because i mean the good think is n
would we get that many people wanting to give talks
well i suppose what we can do is think about the structure now and say right what's the maximum we can do
mm-hmm
so i think that's about as much as we could do to have an hour and a half then have a coffee break
then have an hour and a half then have lunch hour and a half coffee break hour and a half
and so that would be eighteen hours of talks overall wouldn't it
but what do we say
mm-hmm
so it's th so it's twelve thirty six talks is that right
mm-hmm
mm-hmm
maximum thirty six
um
okay let's just put this down
how many second and third year
um students are there
uh
well i could look 'cause i i've got that there's the list isn't there of post graduates i maintain in in linguistics
um there are probably about thirty on there
right okay
um but a good number of them are first years and i don't know i mean just to get an idea are you planning on talking
no
no
are you planning robert
no
and i'm probably not
so there's a good chance that almost none of the first years are gonna volunteer
mm-hmm
um so
if we had say twenty linguistics and even then
i mean there are quite a few people who are abroad and who won't bother to turn up or can't make it or whatever
so you know it might be that we only get say fifteen anyway
and then we could be left with uh fifteen blocks for um the rest of p. p. l. s.
so at least we know that that we've got an absolute limit of about thirty six talks yeah
mm-hmm
um
yeah
we're also gonna be having posters aren't we
and i should imagine that most people would rather do a poster than give a talk
yeah
okay
mm-hmm
and that's that's what uh the coffee breaks will be for and maybe lunchtimes
but coffee breaks are probably more like ab or are gonna be a better time
because people will hang around whereas people are more likely to go off somewhere for lunch aren't they
uh yeah
but w wouldn't we want to actually just like dedicate an afternoon or a morning to being a poster session
yeah
yeah
okay
yeah that's what i was about to say
poster session is a good idea because just the people presenting the posters are there and can say something about it
mm
actually
there's always the problem again then the people who are presenting the posters don't get around to go and look at others' posters
yeah yeah yeah
but let's see about that
but um people kinda like generally sort of sort them out themsel that sort that out themselves
mm-hmm
mm
um i mean it's the thing about posters unless you kind of say you know
mm-hmm
if your name is in the first half of the alphabet you can move and the other ones can't
yeah
so uh how long should a poster session be
like how long will people want to mill around for looking at
i'd make it a whole morning or a whole afternoon
i mean the ju just because like ones that i've been to as well um
people tend to kinda come and go from them
um
mm-hmm
i don't know i mean i i i'd say a whole either a whole morning or a whole afternoon um at least
okay
but that's just ju i mean just based on the ones that i've been to
so that means we could have thirty talks
plus
uh one a. m. or p. m. of posters
yeah
mm-hmm
and we could probably get quite a few in there at least six anyway
at least six
at least six posters if you see what i mean
oh right
okay yeah yeah
during the session like how many can you have going on at once
um well that's just kind of dictated by the size of the room really isn't it
wall space and
yeah
i mean would we have poster boards or is it just gonna be posters on the walls
they did it like um i ha i should have found this out
do we have any information on this
are you guys second years or first years
first years
you're both first year
first years
so n so none of us have been to this before
no
right
i've been to durham uh post graduate conference and i mean every conference i've ever been to
mm-hmm
the posters have always been in the coffee break which is why probably because normally they're limited on space and they
oh
actually we have a message here from mits about the poster session
yeah
poster session was introduced in nineteen ninety nine as part of the main conference
in two thousand it was held separately in october
the intention was to use it as a way to introduce incoming post grad students to the department's research culture
however i did not pursue this idea the following year because the comments i received from students in two thousand were generally discouraging
on the other hand i later learned that some students did find the october poster session quite a useful experience
my suggestion therefore is to re examine the idea of poster session altogether and find a better way to implement it if there seems to be enough interest in it
well i think keeping it
um along side the conference is possibly one way of maintaining interest and
mm
yeah
last sentence
one possibility is to put it back in the main conference and let people choose between a paper presentation and a poster
and uh
yeah i think that's definitely the idea i think the best idea
yeah i think so
mm-hmm
i can imagine it would seem a bit random just have like a poster session and bes uh yeah just have a p a poster session um
what would it be at the beginning
mm-hmm
so i suppose it is it normally uh second years do it like just after they've come back for the s
the
mm-hmm
oh you mean um uh w on the october thing
that's what it would be i think
i thought uh well
it seemed to me that he was saying that everyone would do it ju because its goal was to give the new in take uh idea of
it
mm yeah
yeah but i d i don't think he means that it would be
the first years who've only just arrived would do a poster
oh no no no no yeah yeah
that would be a bit odd wouldn't it
okay so at least anyone who's feeling yeah exactly
but a poster i might do
yeah i i might do i d i still th i'm little bit doubtful
but um so that's good anyway
so
we've got an idea
i think there's thirty talks and and say six ten posters whatever we can manage to fit in the room
mm-hmm
um so we need to look at we need to look at where we're gonna ho hold it
we could have it in b. nine but there's things all over the wall
mm-hmm
mm
there are those pictures that run all the way around so can we take the pictures down
all these dead linguists
can we use b. nine for the posters for instance
um well we should find out if um generally they use poster boards if there are some poster boards that we can get ahold of then that's
mm-hmm
alright
okay so poster boards
and wha uh um what i'll do i'll email mits about that okay
okay
um write into the call that we are considering the idea of having a poster session
mm-hmm
so people can indicate would they prefer to give a poster or a talk
yeah okay
but the ultimate decision is on our side because we have to see how it does it work out with the poster session
okay
how does it work out with the talks
well what we'll do is sa we can just say uh if you want to do a talk
then just say so and if you want to do a poster then say you want to do a poster
mm-hmm
and we can sort of base it around that
yeah
yeah
and if we get absolutely tons of people wanting to do posters and we don't think there's a you know
everyone's kind of done it as a cop out then we might have to sort of say to them well you know
mm
mm-hmm
would you consider doing a talk instead because uh particularly the second and third years
yeah
yeah
yeah
yep
yeah
because we need more talks and just you know do it like that
mm
yep
um we could even say something like um you know
first years might want to give a poster or something like that because i don't know maybe that's a bad idea but
just
throw a general suggestion at them
see what happens
yeah
okay
okay so we got some sort of idea of
the structure and how many talks we're going to be able to have
well the maximum
i mean i guess that that will evolve uh when we get a response from people perhaps
i mean w
yeah
okay
but that's fine isn't it
so we've got three days
so i've uh okay so english language um we'll put on the main call
and i'll just i i'll just kinda market it as an linguistics and english language or something like that i think
mm-hmm
and is the the other main group then um philosophy
yes and informatics we could think about it as well
oh yeah
so i had a look
at whether they do philosophy of a language and logic and stuff here and they kind of do
there's about there's about three or four uh full time members of staff that list um philosophy of language as a major interest
i think they do
mm
so chances are they're gonna have some p. h. d. students that uh are interested
so
do we think we should invite them
i think i'd be surprised if we got sort of four out of them
i think that would be
mm
still yeah
amazing if we did
so i think it's probably worth i don't think we're gonna get inundated with requests
yeah
so i think it's worth asking them
philosophy
yeah
and do you think inf informatics would
i mean i think the informatics are definitely worth asking
uh th there's there's c. s. t. r. and um h. c. r. c.
mm-hmm
mm
i mean i'm thinking that the informatics
potentially is quite a big response
yes
um
it is
yeah might be interesting stuff coming in
read something recently about
i think somebody's masters project to look in how far english is actu uh or in how far english is a shaping influence on programming languages
oh right cool
um
yeah it is
yeah
it
would we wanna ask them and put some kind of like provisor in to make it um specific to sort of preemptively
um weed out the numbers or should we just say to them oh you know we're having this thing about language and
yeah well it would be nice to that
you know if you got something you think about language come to
it would be nice it would be nice to do it
mm-hmm
the thing is we can't afford to bias it towards any particular kind of linguistics in a sense
mm-hmm
because it's such a because of the way our department is then we're supposed to sort of embrace all kinds
yeah
yeah
in fact even by inviting um people from um informatics and from or maybe from philosophy and things it might bias it in a particular direction
but i don't know it's probably not too bad
i i think that i think that between philosophy informatics and um psychology you've probably got quite a lot of breadth there anyway
mm-hmm
um the thing is
uh the one thing is the only kind of people doing anything like applied linguistics are the applied linguists themselves and people in sociology with an interest in language
mm-hmm
and i don't think we'd be inviting them
but i don't think that's too bad because the first thing is there's a good reason for inviting everyone in p. p. l. s. because we are in one school
and then the fact that we also invite people from the informatics i suppose it's just that we do have pretty strong ties with them
and i don't think anyone would be too offended
mm
i hope not anyway
um
so yeah
so what kind of provisor can we put on
i mean we could
we could just say outright anyone in their third year or anyone in their second or third year
but i don't know
hmm
or we can just you know t uh take whatever we get and pick the best between us which is
yeah
y yeah
yeah let's just do that
yeah
that's seems most straight forward
yeah just so so if you just send them a general thing saying the linguistics department's having this conference and would like to invite post graduates from the informatics
yeah
yeah
so
yeah
so you're going to email claire
of
yeah
um
so who wants to send something out to informatics
i'll do that
that's fine
yeah
alright
and should i get in touch with philosophy as well
yeah sure
um so
yeah so what you want to say is anyone who wants to give a talk on logic or philosophy of language
um but put a warning that if it's logic then there's a good chance that no one will understand or not that many
no one will understand
i mean maybe just maybe if you just put
yeah just put philosophy of language
that's that's probably good
yeah
or some
i mean no you if i just send them a thing saying the linguistics department is is having um a postgraduate thing
or just or any ph
some relevance clause
so if you're a philosophy student with um you know and your work has got an interest in language then
yeah
yep
yeah that's it
yeah yeah
that's what you do
yeah that i think that's as much as we need to say
kind of a relevance clause
that's right
so uh you've gotta work out how to do that and who to email
basically what i was thinking was um just sending them your call for papers and ch changing it slightly to say dear philosophy students
mm-hmm
mm
yeah that's fine that's fine
adjust
that's what you wanna do
um as long as it's clear from the subject bar that it's relevant to them and that it says somewhere that
for philosophy students with an interest in language and and that's it
and then between us we'll have to have another meeting and and i mean at the same time as we're sorting through all the other titles and and deciding um how to divide up the sessions
mm-hmm
see someone suggested to me that it's actually better to have talks on a similar topic spread out as much as possible which to me just seemed absolutely crazy
and the reason she gave me was something to do with uh taking out like a whole day or a whole afternoon would be quite difficult
but i think that balance against the fact that most people want to be able to say well look i can have just this one day off
as opposed to when i'll need an hour over three da you know an hour each day for three days
mm-hmm
mm mm
yeah
it you can end up having to take three afternoons or three mornings or whatever off
so i think in general and also for the sake of the lecturers
uh i think a lot of the time simon kirby has already said to me that anyone any of his students he wants to be on the first day
on the wednesday right
and that's because i shifted it i basically had it on monday tuesday
wednesday to begin with and then eve it moved down twice to wednesday thursday friday
mm-hmm
so wednesday is the only day left that he can make
mm-hmm
oh i see right he wants them there because he so he can make it
so
okay
yeah
so and the other thing is um when we get some calls say we have
uh for instance three people supervised by bob ladd
then it might be that then we are gonna have to uh contact bob and say bob these three of your students are gonna be talking
um presu presumably you want to be there
so can you give us a time that would be good for you
and then we can put them in a block at one time
yeah
'cause he says yeah okay thursday afternoon i've got completely free
mm yeah and i think
so i think we do need to stick everyone together uh particularly if they've got the same supervisor
and it's also good if talks are on the same topic for a whole morning or a whole afternoon because then people will come along and go oh
this morning it's all on phonology or this morning it's all on applied linguistics
yeah yeah yeah
and then
okay
mm-hmm
as much as possible anyway
i think that's
so far it's just a general statement of interest what we intend to do
what we actually get to do we'll see later when we have the stuff
yeah
now we need if i'm gonna send out this call uh we need a deadline for titles
mm-hmm
so
um
what should we say
something like 'cause we need a deadline for titles and a deadline for abstracts
so let's set the the latest deadline
the the uh the the sort of abstracts deadline first because we need to have a meeting and that's gonna be when all the real work starts
mm-hmm
yeah
yeah
so what's the absolute latest
i was think i mean maybe the end of
two weeks ahead of
end of march
end of march might be okay
yeah
uh i'm going away for two weeks on the fourth of april
mm-hmm
and then i'm coming back just in time for the conference
so any organising at least stuff where i need to be where we need to meet physically has to be done before that
mm-hmm
yeah and i will be away
probably until easter
so this actually means we have the week directly after easter between my coming back and you leaving
i tell you one thing
to get the stuff done
uh it's starting on the wednesday and the first day back is tuesday
i think i'm coming back
i'm trying to get this right
hopefully i'll be back in time that we'll be able to do something the day before
'cause i think i'm gonna be back
might even have to come in in the evening
but that's not the end of the world but we might have to set some things up
like maybe just get the chairs organised or whatever
mm
we might actually have to go into the rooms and get things ready
and there's gonna be other things like getting the technology ready
so not only is there a pressure to have uh
talks that are on a similar topic together but also if people need the same kind of computer set up
it's good to have them together so we don't have to keep changing it
mm
so because i th i think it was cedric has already offered to do whatever we need him to do
but he just needs to know in advance what people need so that he can be there and and get it ready for them
mm-hmm
mm-hmm
so i think when people
what kinds of things do you think people are actually gonna need
well hopefully most people will d either have something like powerpoint or they'll just have uh p. d. f. slides or something
like
mm-hmm
hopefully no one will have anything too specialized
s sh z
in my experience what you usually should have is some kind of um what's it over head thingo um beamer
yeah
in some cases we might if it's really tough we might be in need of a of some sound system to play recordings
i mean if we do it uh th hasn't b. nine got all of that
yeah it's got a lot in there
should be there yeah
but i think it does take a little bit of i mean uh i think sometimes maybe people need to be in linux rather than windows and so booting in and out
adjusting
yeah
mm-hmm
yeah
m is sometimes an issue i think
um
but i think what we should say is when i put out this call
i'll put both deadlines and i think i'll say that when you send in your abstract
you need to mention that any technology you intend to use so that at least if we have all the information yeah
mm-hmm
yep
so um so deadlines
um okay so let's think about this
if if we gave them a whole month or just over a month then
that would be okay wouldn't it because we've still got
oh no it wouldn't be okay at all
if we gave them the whole month that'd give us hardly any time
so if we gave them say till mid march that would be good
mm-hmm
yeah
so give them something like give them something like ten days or whatever to get the title in
and then give them a week on top of that to get the actual abstract done
and the abstract doesn't have to be much it's probably only half a side of a. four or something isn't it
mm
just enough that we can see whether it's interesting or what kind of area it fits into
yeah
that's all we really need
mm-hmm
um see ideal ideally i would've liked to have given them a bit longer
but i think w
nah
that will be okay
no way anymore
okay
so unfortunately i don't have a calendar
um so let's just
mm neither do i
you're gonna send that pan pen crazy
that's true
no it's i think it's okay when you're not writing on there
um so
so
uh
thirty one oh no it's twenty eight this
this month isn't it
mm-hmm
two three four
i could create us another calendar
so if we have it like a monday monday the fourteenth'd probably be quite good for the final deadline
mm-hmm
and then um if i send it out tomorrow we'll say something like the el
or maybe the fourth would be good
so give them a w yeah a week for the title and then they would have about ten days from then to actually get the abstract in
for the title deadline
yeah
does that sound reasonable
why not just give them a week to do the abstract
i mean i'm just thinking about um
just put it here yeah
the eleventh
a bit earlier
so i'm saying a week from when i send it out
oh no no no i was s i was saying ju just give them a bit longer to get back with the title
say get back with the title by the seventh
or do we need ten days to go from
mm-hmm
that would be a week anyway
yeah
that would be a week anyway but you can give them ten days to you can give them ten days to get the title
yeah
or you can give them it depends which way around you wanna do it
yeah
so what's gonna take them longer actually to decide what they're gonna do and send the title
or is it gonna be on the basis of the title do they want more time to write the abstract
uh f i think if they're really serious
to be a bit late with the title might not be bad because it will help them to
so give them the seventh yeah
yeah
mm yeah
okay so
yep
so monday the seventh is the title
and this presumably will apply across the board
like um
mm-hmm
yep
and monday the fourteenth for the abstract
and we've got they we've got an email address for them to send all this to haven't we
or what was it
well we we kind of have
i d uh we were given
getting access to the uh to the account
blah blah blah blah
the only thing is acce is accessing the account
they can send it to p. g. c. at ling as long as we can get the wh i'll tell you what i'll do then
yeah
yeah
yep
i'll go and see mike th today and and get the password and everything
'cause
we possibly have it but i'll just sort that out with him
because if we're gonna tell everyone to email p. g. c. then we have to make pretty sure that we can actually access the account and that it's operational and stuff
mm
'cause uh so far i've just been using my own uh email address
but it would be better it's quite easy to send f from an email address
mm-hmm
'cause you can send from any email address you like
it's just the fact that you need to p uh it's just the fact that when they reply to it you need to be able to uh access it
yeah
so i already tried it once and i'm sure they gave us a password
and i even i even actu
yeah
oh well that's it then
we've got it all written down
no problem
that's it
so does i
i mean it
you may already know but the thing is if you want to send this call for abstracts
you know when you do the philosophy and and thingy one
then if you want to send from p. g. c. then uh i mean you might already know
but you can go f if if you did it from web mail
you can just create a new account for yourself and where it sa it actually has a send from address
and you can just put p. g. c. at ling dot and just do it that way
mm-hmm
uh or depending on your normal email client you might be able to do it but it doesn't matter too much
yeah
the the the other thing you could do is have is just fill in the reply to address as p. g. c. depending on what you wanna do
yeah
but that's what i'll do
i'll send it from p. g. c. so if anyone replies it would just go to that account and any of us can access it at any time
presumably you can access from web mail or you know or i. map or whatever
should i take care of the web page
yeah if you want to to create a web page and just copy my email into it or something
and anything else you might wanna do and then later on we can put the uh the programme in
mm-hmm
yeah
yeah
mm-hmm cool
so um
hmm
okay
oh right yeah
no
oh so am i
is it five t is it almost two
it's not quite it's p two or three minutes to
not quite but almost
oh my microphone fell off
you you got something for two haven't you
yeah
right
okay
so very quickly then can we arrange a new time to have a meeting
do you think we need to how long do you think until we need to meet again
have we got enough to be getting on with
we probably have haven't we
yeah
uh i mean that's just um
so i mean maybe m i mean ideally i suppose we'll meet again here
so we can with melissa and we'll just send out an email
yeah
okay
yeah and uh that that would be cool
um
okay so um i mean i won't get in touch with philosophy
or i won't send anything to philosophy and informatics till i've got your email
'cause i'll just tell 'em a modified version of that
yep
that's fine
but i'll try and get a good address to send it to
mm-hmm
alright
so that was a note
and i'm okay
i think latest s soon as the call is out
yep
because then we have the call thing we have that away and look at the boar organisatorial stuff like uh
do we know about chairs tea and stuff
alright we're finished
okay
more
if not more yeah
mm
okay
okay
so the three of you and let's see m um myself and maarika
who's not here and but i think so it it occasionally melissa will all be doing checking of the transcriptions
mm-hmm
so this is the second pass these transcriptions are receiving and that's pretty straight forward
i think you all kn basically have an idea what's involved
okay
um but the extra step that we're asking you to do f in this case is to look at the silent regions and listen to them for each channel and um make sure that no back channels were lost for example
um yeah back channels is what you n typically would find although by and large these are gonna be silent
so
so you can um start s checking by y well you you know
you can order it in any way you like but um start with the first channel and go through it entirely
um i would recommend i've found that it's easier when you're checking and you're trying to make sure the boundaries are right for a speech segment
mm-hmm
i would recommend like say this one
go down here to the uh trascription transcription tier and select that it so that uh when you play
you're certain that when it stops you've caught the whole speech signal for that utterance and haven't lost any signal information
mm
um otherwise it it's liable to keep on running and you might not notice where it where it finishes
so it it takes a little time
but um alternatively
i you you could just listen to the speech segments again and make sure everything is correct for those and so you could just hit um
and then
like that
and then go back and check the the silence regions
mm-hmm
in between
how it if if you wanna make your job a little more interesting you can d do it in m different ways on a different day
yeah
it doesn't matter
as long as it gets done
so we so are we checking what's actually been transcribed already as well as the silences
so
yeah yeah
yeah
you're doing so that's that's the role of the checker is to check what's said in the silent regions uh in the speech regions and then make sure nothing was lost in the silent regions
mm-hmm
oh okay
you're also um responsible for resolving any um uncertainties that were marked by the original transcriber
mm-hmm
and and you know of course there are gonna be m many situations where you like the first transcriber can't make any sense of it
and in that case it will be up to you to use the at symbol
um and that can be used uh to represent one um unintelligible word or multiple intelligible words but just use one at symbol
um yeah mm-hmm exactly
and so that um once you go through all the s um speech regions and all the um non speech regions
an o you could make another step of doing a search using um going under the edit menu you can
do a search for yeah find replace for open parentheses and that'll take you to any that it any that the first transcriber might have marked out
find replace yeah
so there's one
and then you can just resolve those all one by one as as a different set of um changes altogether
uh-huh
oh alright 'kay
and and likewise for the double question marks
just once you've gone through um and resolved all the open parentheses you can do the same for op uh double question marks
oh yeah
and um and like i said if you if you can't make any sense of it then just use the at symbol
if you can um just give it you know give it your best guess in these cases
how much should you want um i had a few times where i thought well it could be this
if
mm-hmm
but if you're not entirely sure that it could be 'cause it c it could be a combination of something else
yeah
like put the guess down or leave it as ambiguous in some way
yeah it's i would uh if you're v if you're quite certain then i would go ahead and um type what you think it was said
right
if if you v think that n y there's maybe a th thirty percent chance you're wrong or or more
there's a chance they could be
it's usually a context problem because i think sometimes if it's not intelligible you either tend to because you really want it to fit the context
yeah
yeah
mm yeah
um you tend to take the closest actual word that would fit the context
or if it sometimes it sounds very clear as a word itself but then wouldn't make sense at all
and then you m question you know second guess whether it's really what you heard
right
so maybe a good idea would be to listen to each channel one by one do listen to the silent and non silent regions and make all those corrections
leave the unknowns the um ambiguities the uncertainties uncertainties until later
so go through all the channels and do that and then um then you should have the context from all four speakers
yeah
mm-hmm
and then go back and do those searches one by one for each channel
how would that be
does that sound good
mm
yeah it does tend to help
mm that's what i've been doing so far
yeah
okay
once you've been through the passage you've worked out what they're talking about you know
it took li it like the third time 'til i thought oh you're saying f. five
you'll you'll know all too well what was said in this meeting by the time you
yeah
yeah
yeah i think that would be really helpful
hmm
it just came out of nowhere
that would help us um you know nab a good number of those uncertainties
but if there's a chance that it's equally likely that they could have said something or they could have said something like ice cream and i scream
mm
then just choose one and leave it right
choose one it c i mean y think of it from a speech recognition point of view again
and always this should be this should motivate you
be robust
mm-hmm
yeah
what is most robust for a speech recognition and and leave out anything so you're well geared towards this task
we just started our speech recognition assignment just now
that's always fun
um so i've gone through sorry
i've done that too
you're an s. l. p. person
oh never i i don't wanna interrupt it
oh no no no
uh uh when i did my masters um i took uh s. p. one and s. p. two with simon king
go ahead go ahead
you survived s. p. one and s. p. two
yes
and actually i've done quite well in s. p. one i've done it a bit worse in s. p. two because it was a l a lot more challenging
we have two new teachers for s. p. two
okay
too many
and uh i'll ask you later on like if you still have your notes
yeah
right
okay
back to the topic
okay okay
so um this is one i've gone through
i've just done one channel
and there were lots of lots and lots and lots of things as you can see
'cause i've got square brackets around all the things that need to be changed
mm-hmm
um so this person didn't ha um th obviously didn't know about capitalisation
so just about every utterance needs to be capitalised and and needs the end punctuation
you know
when you get like um someone's talking and there's they sort of pause in the middle of a sentence that's long enough for it to put a break in
yeah
but they're actually sort of carrying on the sentence do you have to capitalise each time you transcribe a bit if it's mid
um no no no
whatever um makes sense to you
no no no no
yeah
okay
um but no it it can continue into the next segment and that's perfectly fine
yeah
just okay
yeah
so it's put the hyphen and then
i think that's actually the only case where you don't or where you're not supposed to capitalise right
mm the hyph
um
right
so if it's quite clear that the sentence is being carried on the p you know
the sentence from the previous segment is being carried on then that's when you don't capitalise
otherwise you do
okay
and you only use the hyphen i think when the sentence is definitely not continuing anywhere
yes
oh right okay
yeah
i've done a few of those wrong then when someone comes to check it
yeah
as in like it's
i'll review some of these things um after i go through this a bit um just to re cap
yeah
yeah
th these are things that i've after checking um t everybody's work um these are things that were commonly left out or you know misc mis transcribed whatever
mm-hmm
okay
so i'll go over those t as an opportunity to use the white board
um um okay
so uh this person left out a lot of end punctuation and um here's a case where i think she was transcribing an out breath um or possibly an in breath uh t uh in and used the hash mark
in any case i didn't hear anything and and you shouldn't be transcribing in breaths or out breaths
okay
right
that's n information we don't need
oh you know this is the head set mic and i heard something there
it was the creaky voice
it was but it wa yeah it was a bit of a yeah it was creaky so yeah f uh
creaky voice
yeah
but it is c really connected to the word
can we hear it again
yeah
and you sometimes you don't know really whether it's a mic noise or that person is making that noise
yeah well i didn't think it was im let's see wait
yeah
yeah
from the
s there's there's actually quite a bit more in there than than i heard before
from the
this is so i w i heard a creaky voice and it was audible of the level of the rest of the speech
so i would i would keep that
i think that's good
oh okay
i was adding that that's what i was doing
yeah
that makes sense
okay there you go
um so there's things like that
um sh there's a missing false start here um that didn't get caught
okay
so i added that in
um so that that's something that's quite common in the transcriptions that i've looked at
okay
missed false starts um missed m
and how exact do we have to be there
because um you know some people tend to stutter more than others and then they would have a false start four or five times in a row
and how important is it to listen to it really until you've got the exact number of a things right
try to get it right
yeah
i mean the it i think syllables should be accounted for for th
yeah
well 'cause sometimes they go you know like that and then you're not really sure whether it's three times or four yeah
yeah well don't let it drive you crazy 'cause there is one speaker melissa just played for me today and he stutters horribly
i mean i i i'd you know it's unfortunate for him and for us 'cause it's really gonna be a nightmare to transcribe
yeah
yeah
yeah
so you will have to draw the line somewhere
yeah
but if you c if it's say four repeated um if the word is repeated four times uh then that's not too hard to count
mm-hmm
i haven't come across something that's been i haven't come across anything exceeding four i don't think
yeah
have you
well it's not that the word is if the word were the whole word were being used four times
mm-hmm
mm-hmm
that wouldn't have been that difficult but sometimes it's just a false start
which is really just maybe one or one and a half phones and then repeated and then you don't really know whether one is a long duration of one or whether it's actually two
uh-huh
yeah yeah
and that kind of thing so it's i think it was a word starting with d. and the person was going or s you know
yeah
yeah
make your best guess
yeah
try to listen to it carefully enough but not not so that you're obsessing over it for too long
i would say
and sometimes with the i would be thinking are you anticipating a or you're you t trying to say the and you're just saying the the the the the
hmm
alright
well there again f uh think about robustness and speech uh recognition and it really doesn't matter
yeah
mm-hmm
yeah
if it's a word fragment who cares
yeah
well speaking about
it you're marking it as a fragment and that's what's important
yeah yeah
speaking about robustness if if somebody has an accent that you can only really understand what they're saying due to world knowledge yeah it what they say
it doesn't really actually sound at all you know what it is
then do you transcribe more phonetically or do you put uh uh a star of after every single one word
well um i wouldn't de be using the star so liberally um for a non native speaker
or
yeah that's what i thought that you're not supposed to do it but um the one there's one i'm transcribing right now
you know a whole batch of dialogues where uh all four participants are non native
and there's especially one there that um i think he's eastern european and i think that's the only reason i can understand what he's saying at all
because i'm eastern european and uh but if we would just play it i think to a recognizer
then what he says you know the way he realises words sounds nothing at all like it it should be
mm-hmm
well right right
um i mean and and for that matter a lot of n native english speakers' realisations aren't going to be so true to um
yeah
yeah
i try to take consistency if they always stress the wrong part of the word
yeah
then i think okay i'll let that in but if if it comes out and like one word is
yeah yeah
no it's less of a s it's less of a stress
it's really like uh his uh i don't know just the phonemes sounding differently
yeah
well i wouldn't bother to mark all of those instances though
well you can't really because it would be all of it
no i mean yeah they're they're uh you're gonna find that for any speaker they have a set way of of realising these things
and and it's just like fiona was saying um that the the word that stands out is something really uh aberrant
like um i'm thinking of i i've used this example before
there's a guy who says project instead of product and uh it's something like project and it's probably just his his pronunciation of of
oh
oh
ah
yeah
mm
oh i think i've transcribed him and i had project at all um evolution criteria
yeah
well it it they were clearly talking about a product
so so uh i m i marked that as a m uh mispronunciation or s or something to flag anyway
yeah
mm
okay
yeah
and one guy who was saying evolution each time he meant evaluation and it took me a whole dialogue yeah yeah
oh evaluation
yeah i i've i remember that
that one i would i would flag just like you did
it that's something definitely to mark up
yeah but that's really something i would always transcribe it you know for lack of better knowledge or lack of context
and then at the end of the dialogue it dawned on me that he actually meant evaluation
yeah
mm yeah
and then i went back and replaced i replaced it in the whole transcription
that's good
that's good
well at the moment we have a lecturer that can i can never quite s tell if he's saying problem or programme
programme problem
yeah
and it i can't actually say but when i'm listening to i'm thinking and i can't tell
yeah
alright
yeah i kn i don't know what to s tell you about n um certain speakers
yeah
yeah basically th i think just do your best and hope for the best
i it's just something we have to deal with
hope he's not involved with these actually
yeah
i hope he's not involved with this
yeah
yeah
okay
so oop i lost my lapel lapel mic
that'll give some transcriber a headache
yeah
well we have both head set and lapel transcription
wait
so it's not too bad
oops
least i won't be transcribing the what do i care
yeah let's have maarika transcribe that
okay so um there've there've been lots of missed filled pauses
everybody seems to miss those some more than others
so just really keep an ear out for those
it's easy to 'cause you're so used to t t tuning them out
um
mm
and you know it's easy when i go back over i normally g like go back to the beginning
mm-hmm
do a quick pass of the main sections again and think ah yeah
mm-hmm
yeah
yeah
i i'm not sure i miss them plenty myself
but um this this second pass we should really try to catch all of them or at least most of th yeah
um sorry i'm just seeing this with the t. v. there is t. underscore v. underscore
mm-hmm
i thought we're just supposed to use the underscore between letters
no no
no
after
that's what i thought the first day as well
okay sorry then i've done it wrong so far
okay
yeah it should be after every um acronym letter
okay
you know um you standardised all the the filled pauses the uh and do we need to go through and change ones that people did differently
like if i where i've written e. r. for uh change it all to u. h. that sort of thing
yeah yeah
so at this point the um the only file that's been checked is melissa one that melissa did and that was checked by me
mm-hmm
mm-hmm
um so w we we're starting fresh with these and you know
right
changes like that that were just announced we'll we'll be able to catch for these first passes
yeah
okay
so yeah y if you do see um something like um u. h. m. for um you you would change that to the regularised v version
yeah just change it to um
mm-hmm
okay
um and we just ch you know this is arbitrary but we had to choose something and not let it get too convoluted with um with choice
yeah
yeah
here's
so if they pause just where you've got it highlighted at the moment
uh-huh
that wor the hyphen
mm-hmm there
so i have to re do the meetings from the minutes from the last meeting
was she was that a like w r real definite i'm starting a new sentence here
'cause i'd sometime if it sounds like he could carry on saying the whole sentence i sometimes don't have a hyphen there
um i
but is it a t any hesitation
but it is a back track
yeah
okay
yeah yeah
okay
so it's not necessarily restarting the sentence but just a restart of any type
we do the meeting
the minutes yeah
right
yeah i think of it in terms of you know not even maybe to well
a phrase
if i th if you think of it in terms of a syntactic tree
yeah
it n doesn't have to go back all the way to the s. node
but it just m it might go back to the last node or something like that
yeah
just one to the next door yeah
mm-hmm
yeah
yeah
thank you for that description beata
oh goodness who would know what that was uh if somebody that didn't know about linguistics were trying to transcribe s. node
well it's just my way of of knowing if it w sorry 'cause linguistics is all i've ever known
yeah
yeah
yeah
here's a uh so that answers your question about that answers your question about this one up here
sorry
yes yeah
okay
here's where i've i heard a another sound another false start
um or a stutter i would say
let me see
oh yeah
i'm not seeing where this is
you're three lines in
okay
okay okay
okay
so that kind of thing
mm-hmm
mm-hmm
and there was a vowel in there but you noticed that she just used the and that's fine
what's the
okay
the the letter d.
yeah
what's the c.
is that a
that's she would like see
she
there's a d judgment is that that
oh sorry
i didn't go f back far enough
oh i've not used that button yet
where you've written at et cetera is that how we're supposed to be writing it
yes
okay
um where is that
yes she's so she spelled it wrong
yeah
where
um uh up here
oh et cetera
yeah so i d i mentioned that because of spelling
and yes any g
is it one word or is it two words
i
it's one word
okay
so i d i just said spelling
because i thought it would be like et alii
it's an admonishment
sorry
but in sh it isn't it in latin like et cetera like et alii or
et cetera
uh like a. t. is uh
no no no like et w you know when you have uh when you have a citation and you say et al it means and others
mm-hmm
et et al et alii is the full word and et cetera means and following
so
in the dictionary here it's one word
yeah
oh in it is okay yeah
yeah yeah yeah
if you have any questions about spellings i i i think i m might have sent an email to this effect just check the oxford english dictionary online
mm-hmm
okay
uh and that's that will be our guide
um so a as far as i know this is just missing an e. cetera
mm-hmm yeah
um but anyway
you can
we've considered experimenting with running this through a spell check
you could take this as an emacs file and run a spell check on it
mm
mm-hmm
but i think it would slow things down too much
yeah
yeah
so just hopefully i in going through this very carefully you're going to notice these misspellings
i think
would give emacs a headache as well
yeah
yeah
i think i if somebody could write i don't know how difficult it would be in practice to write a script that would ignore um all the word fragments
anything with a hyphen
then a spell check might make make sense
mm-hmm
but uh to just use simple emacs it will uh basically mark um all the word fragments for you and uh you know
mm-hmm
and i know from experience at some point you also get negligent
you just click okay okay okay you know that's not a mistake and then you might miss a real error
yeah yeah
right
so it doesn't make any sense
yeah i th i think you're right
so we'll we will just hope that you catch it
um that's what we'll do
mm-hmm
yeah the c.
um
okay
so
sorry
so i think she just she didn't catch the full form
okay
she was cutting off rather than saying she would like s to have see something
yeah
right right
yeah
yeah
she i think she meant to use the infinitive but she just left off the to
but see is a actual full word shouldn't it there b shouldn't there be a space between see and the hyphen
is a whole word
a space between she would like see
you know not to be not to be pedantic
yeah
she would like see
after the no the the c. and the hyphen shouldn't there be a space
yes yes yes you're right
yeah
okay
'kay
exactly
thanks that's what i was asking
yeah
uh that was what you were m remarking about
i should've just said it that way
yeah
okay
there we go
let me save that
okay
what else
um be careful about um finding mis transcriptions
so um
um the would and w
so she t she transcribed that as would
okay
and so
uh-huh
no
but sometimes it's really difficult sometimes you really don't know whether they're saying will or would
well i think it's quite clear there
that one was clear
yeah he it it's his yeah
i mean obviously there are gonna be ca
but if if it's not clear do i just pick uh do you just pick the more grammatic alternative
or
no you try to keep it as true to what's being said
b yeah
but if it but if it's really not absolutely not clear
then use um
when they say instea you know some people when they swallow up the the last bit
mm-hmm
or do we just then transcribe
i'd have to hear it because it m sounds like it could be a fragment
yeah
yeah
yeah
uh it ju i'd just have to hear it
um m i'd you don't want to b um be prescriptive and and type what you think they should've said
mm-hmm
yeah
yeah
but
but i i i do know the type of scenario you're describing
i just it's just hard to answer that without hearing something
mm-hmm
mm
the um should be capitalised
yeah they should all i i stopped marking them 'cause there are just too many
yeah
okay
but
should it
'cause the loose uh is continuing from one sentence isn't it
uh let's see
oh yeah y you're right
oh okay
right
no
that's right
yeah
okay
there was a yes in there
um and
okay
was there
yes
okay
yeah
oh yeah
so another missed false start
um
there was creakiness on the she
but you don't need to mark that as a separate sound
um
sometimes i've made buts after la like words after laughter i've made them capitalised
'cause i've not been sure if there's an if the laughter's been cutting everything off
mm
if it sounds like um the laughter is just um interrupting a an utterance that continues after the laughter i wouldn't worry about capitalising
yeah
mm-hmm
um okay so what about if a whole utterance is uttered while laughing
do you put the laughter in front
during
or in what i usu when that happens what i do is i put laughter in front
then the whole sentence and laughter in you know at the end as well
if you hear just laughter on either side yeah do that
so
yeah
no but it's it's laughter th throughout
yeah yeah mm i don't know we'll have to i'll
yeah
there's some people laughing themselves silly at absolutely nothing while while they speak
okay so laughter during speech
mm-hmm
i'll f i'll talk to melissa and jean
because in the icsi dialogues um they always say you know while laughing and we don't do that
s
mm-hmm
so they say either so there it's really not ambiguous whether it's just laugh followed by an a normally spoken utterance or whether it's an utterance spoken while laughing
mm-hmm
i think there is a distinction there and we don't have that
mm-hmm
no we don't have any qual tags like they use
yeah
but um i'll f i'll
i'll figure that one out and put it up on the wiki or email you
'kay
good question
i've come across that as well
mm see
oh yeah i don't know what that that noise was indicating
um we can skip on
there are other types of things i wanna point out
um let's see
morse code
was that circuit
okay
i figure if she is a person that calls circuit circuit
did you
morse
did she say circuit
i didn't really hear that
how do you know it's that
i'm not sure if she did
so would would you have been tempted to put an asterisk after that
just um if it's her i just caught the end of it and
uh yeah
no not for that one
cir circuit
but i had one person who said circuit
yeah
oh okay
but then i w but then i wouldn't put an asterisk on it
the
i thought asterisk is something where um it's c it's pronounced as a totally different word like evaluation and evolution
no not necessarily
no
no it's just something that the speech recognizer is liable to trip up on i think
okay
oh
yeah cause i this is a very frequent mistake that no native speakers make to say circuit instead of circuit
mm-hmm
mm-hmm mm-hmm
um y that may be but i probably would flag it
i depending on how how different the vowel sound was
mm
it's gonna be your call in a lot of these cases
oops
yeah something like if ha i did that one 'cause it is well a language teacher wouldn't low allow that to mo move on to the next stage
that wouldn't they wouldn't let that pass
mm
mm
sort of
okay here
or i wouldn't
if somebody that i'd point it out to them
here's a case of um where i found it n uh found a case of discontinuity
but you know because she's a non native english speaker i don't i don't know
maybe that was grammatically n uh
unmarked for her
if you know what i mean
yeah
maybe that wasn't uh her re starting maybe sh that was
yeah 'cause otherwise you could end up putting a hyphen after every hesitation mark that you have
yeah
mm mm-hmm mm-hmm
so again i don't know
that w that was my reflex at the time to put that there
just if
but
just a prosodic marker rather than an actual hesitation
yeah
well
uh as in a whole s like back channel
unless you kinda get right
oh yeah sorry
i th i just read the rest of the sentence
is push buttons two words
uh yeah yeah
i used one word
yeah i would type it as two
okay
mm okay i'm gonna skip ahead
oh let's see there was a c
so i i hear she would quite clearly there and i think a good number of them you'll be able to resolve just just helps to have the context and be able to listen to it again
yeah
yeah
okay
well it could be she would or should as well
well
yeah
okay
yes it could be a lot of things
um
so there is there is another case where there wasn't a space between uh
right
a non word fragment and um
mm
a re start
okay
what else
there is an extra little symbol in here and that was just kinda carelessness
um
so d even if it's something as brief as mm-hmm we're we're gonna go ahead and capitalise that
and maarika asked me what to do in the case of an utterance just consisting of laughter
do we do we use punctuation in these cases and i don't know
i haven't been
i haven't either
i don't think it's necessary
no
it's just too silly
yeah
uh no
'cause it's not linguistic
um
well not yeah
i'm just thinking of uh you know an utterance consisting entirely of laughter and then putting like punctuation in like
i know i yeah you could think of an argu
or should we start it if we start the conversation in the common room like is laughter linguistic then they could come up with a theory
someone's gonna have fun transcribing that now
delete and collapse
sorry
yeah
but
i'm trying to underst i'm trying to interpret my note here
delete and collapse the surrounding segments
okay i guess there there just really wasn't enough to transcribe there
oh d
yeah
yeah because it was it was really just silence and you're asking the person to just get rid of
yeah
so like i said click down here just to if you haven't learned that trick already
yeah
and that won't play any surrounding segments
mm-hmm
so there's nothing there worth transcribing
okay
um
uh
oh i just noticed the the random yeahs like with having the hyphen before they're s
uh if you scroll up a little way
uh-huh
yeah that ha um the second one from the top
thinking i'm gonna have to go back and find my places where i've had someone pausing and then saying yeah yeah and then this that i've not had i need to go back and find uh p put hyphens in
this one
oh so you haven't put a hyphen there
i see i see
mm
yeah
okay
hyphens or commas
commas
commas did you say
yeah
oh
for g for that s type of situation
no s alright
no i've i've th i've sort it out
yeah
yeah okay
actually um a couple of times where they've repeated a word i've put a comma between them
should that be no comma
commas are fine
oh r okay
i mean they're eventually they're going to be extracted globally so it doesn't matter how you use the comma
right
oh right okay
alright okay
oh
okay
yeah we can just wipe them out in one fell swoop
okay
so we don't have to worry about commas
yeah
okay
'cause i get i get quite prolific with my commas at times
i i am too
so um
i i like commas and then uh steve renals who's project manager had a look at m i think it was my transcriptions
yeah
okay
what are all these commas doing in here
but he didn't he ultimately he said it wasn't a problem
okay cool
they will i th they'll help in the case of discourse marking but his point was that they're really subjective
i mean something that you the transcriber here yeah yeah
yeah
yeah
just to make sense of a sentence
yeah
i really like using commas
i i read somebody's p. h. d. proposals yesterday and s and it's saying well you could have a comma in here and one there and
oh
sh oh she spelled cutest um with an i. so that that's just something i pointed out
what does cutest spelling mean
oh okay
oh yeah
okay
okay what else
um
cutest
e. s. t.
thank you
so here's let's see
now this was our
that one step behind
so she typed uh our and i i didn't quite hear that
oh okay
but
but i you can see how it could've been i don't know
oh
oh
yeah
well if you were cockney then sorry
yeah i don't know
sometimes you get like an uh and it g you're not sure if it's an an a. yeah or an m it yeah
a. or
right
and you can never know but if it fits well enough as a as an indefinite article then you might as well
as an
yeah do it as okay
so which did you dec uh did
oh i was s i was suggesting that sh it be uh instead of our
but
evaluation
yeah i it's tricky it gets ambiguous
yeah
the z z
several vowels in there
evaluala
um i don't know
uh what's this
well oh she's
i hear the well there
yeah
yeah
yeah
the but this being a head set mic channel m may make it easier to hear
yeah
she transcribed from the lapel mic
i've had one person with a dodgy headphone with with dodgy something where most of the time it's it's as if they've got their hand over something
uh
oh
oh
oh god
that's harsh
and you transcribed that speaker entirely
yes the uh yeah it w it's for
if that comes up again we've got um headset mic files now
in fact they replaced all the lapel mic files on the m. m. m. server with head set mic files
right
mm-hmm
hmm
oh okay
which we weren't asking them to do but anyway they did it
and so now we don't have the lapel mic files
apparently the headset mic files are are just a bit louder
and so you'll f probably find yourself turning the volume down considerably
right
right
but but apparently other than that they're just as good
thank you for the warning
right
but let us know because we can retrieve the the other files
yeah with some people it actually leads to some really screeching noises because they're so loud or probably the mic is so close
i had this one um in one of the first dialogues i did the g this guy called ed
you could uh always see the waveform actually you know
being just hitting um the b the boundaries on on both ends and just being at some points just black segments
yeah
and when he was talking there was this whole like you know when you speak to close to a microphone and that was really horrible
lot of people that say is this on and they hit it a few times
oh
no
okay
i don't think i'm gonna go through uh any more of these because i i think i've gotten through most of the types that i meant to point out
the rest
hmm
how about names that somebody says the name of somebody and you think who
mm
uh right right
and you don't know how to spell the name or if you heard the right name
um what are we going to do for that
mister ed
sorry
oh i had one guy one of the project managers was um he had a really weird accent and he was calling um one guy mister ed
mister ed
mister ed
his name was ed and it took me a whole time to you find out that it was actually mister ed
yeah
or myst mystery ed or something
or
yeah
oh it
no but that it wasn't one word that it wasn't like some proper name starting with m.
yeah
mm-hmm
mister ed
i d i did see s i've been looking at some guidelines for another corpus and i did see something about proper names
so i'll i'll have a look at that and see how we can handle that here
yeah
right
well but don't you guys have um have this data
what
know the people na people's names like when you
uh yeah quite possibly but since it's coming from icsi uh it's coming from idiap in switzerland
collect the data th aren't people filling out a form or something
yeah it w it should be easy enough to get but it's it's one other step
you know emailing somebody to find out who knows this information
okay
yeah
anyway it's
no but it's information that we theoretically have
yeah yeah because everyone signs a consent form when they participate in the experiment
mm
so we ought to be able to get that
we didn't sign one
but but there shou we should also have a w a means of dealing with proper names when we don't know what it is or how it might be spelled at all and and flagging that in in some way
mm-hmm
so i'll th i'll i'll try to address both things
mm-hmm
okay
what was mister again
i can't remember seeing how to transcribe mister
mister just to
oh just just type mister fully
m. m. r. mister
yeah
m. i. s. t. e. r.
i m. i. s. t. e. r. yeah
no m.
and same with missus m. i. s. s. u. s. i believe
mi u. s. mi missus the missus
okay missus
is it i believe i believe check check the dictionary
sorry
that yeah but you would never um type the abbreviated spelling for anything
missus
missus
um
yeah
what if somebody calls themselves ms
right
um well i'm sure there's a spelling in the o. e. d. yeah
i mean it's not not that it ever happened but yeah
m. i. z.
yeah
so um about um foreign words what do we when we're checking um if we come up something so we just leave it as
uh-huh
oh right
so the transcriber's enclosing everything in carets and what you would do is
is that
yeah
yeah
not come across any yet
i got one which i it was french so i knew how to ex spell it
oh
yeah
that's a good question because you will be leaving question marks there
yeah
um okay
i mean if it's in carets and they know it's foreign does that matter
right
um it shouldn't because things are going to be left like the asterisk will be left for the proc the subsequent processing
yeah and the at symbol
yeah
but carets with question marks in between would have to be resolved in some way
or could we just change it to an at between the carets
yeah
'cause it's only intelligible theoretically
yeah
yeah
yeah
i i suppose that's all we can do really
yeah
you're not supposed to be polyglot transcribers here
yeah
oh so even if we know what that word means we're not supposed to right
oh yeah yeah
if you if if f it's a foreign word and you know what it is just enclose it in carets
yeah
yeah 'cause i have there is one dialogue where i think two speakers are french like one is definitely french
and i know she is saying and then somebody s saying something to her and she goes comment and then you know you know that so yeah
mm-hmm
yeah
yeah yeah
if you if you're confident that you've got a fair grasp on french for example why not
okay
oh not really but on comment yeah
and not accidentally translating in the process
yeah
okay
um there is there is just one other thing she she typed okay um in caps
oh yeah i saw it there
o. c c o. capital o. capital k. and huge no no i don't know why she missed that in the in the guidelines
ok
no
yeah
there it was
are we doing okay just as o. k. not as a o. k. a. y.
yeah
okay
no
it is o. k. a. y.
a. y. alright oops
yeah yeah
okay oops
okay
okay
well it will be your jobs to catch all of these things
someone's gonna find some of those
so no um n no transcriber will be checking no checker will be checking their t own transcription
yeah
their own
checking their own work
checking their own transcription
yes
right
yes
so we will catch these things
no transcriber will be checking their own transcriptions
have to remember that one now
more efficiently i think
and on so i'll just go up to the board do i have to keep this stuff on
probably
guess it depends how far you can stretch
oh yeah they've got clips
oh yeah 'cause every time somebody'd be going over there you'd hear all this sound of
right i'm mobile
d yeah
wrestling to the white board
yeah i can hear the chairs moving and the
alright
and about five or six breaks in the between is the making it a
yeah
okay
so i guess just for the sake of using the white board and killing a little more time i'll just write down the things that are most common to be checked
so let's see
so oh okay
now
oh the white board marker has a camera as well
looks like some piece of medical equipment
wow
okay s alright
rather this is a list of things to do as the checker
so you wanna listen to the silent regions
mm-hmm
then check the speech regions
and as part of that you want to um check the boundaries
and oh by the way this should be um
um transcribe
any missed speech
and just let's see what else
okay
and within this checking the speech segments you want to listen for or look for missed um
look for missed punctuation
filled pauses
words in stuttering
and if you have um if you have a stuttered word you don't need to use the hyphen to mark discontinuity
it's just so if somebody says the the then it's just the the
okay
oh yeah
um words in st uh
and what else
try to get f false starts
short words make sure with little words like the and uh little articles and that kind of thing don't get omitted
um short words and word fragments
those are the commonly missed things
and then um look for cases of mis transcription
seems so silly to be writing this all
but anyway mis transcription so make sure if the speaker said will
you type will not would or um if they say we even though it might be more grammatically correct to type we're um that kind of thing
um tha cases of ellipsis where um maybe the transcriber typed them but really what was said was 'em so where you use the apostrophe
m.
mm-hmm
and look for capitalisation i'm not gonna gonna do any more of this
oh
capitalisation
spelling
um use the o. e. d. to check on things you don't know about
um refer to the wiki for all regularised spellings and f for things like filled pauses
mm-hmm
i just remembered one
oh was that
okay when it's just as 'kay but it's at the beginning of a sentence should the k. be capitalised
no well apostrophe and then k. a. y.
w
w
and then yeah capitalise the k.
good
yeah
and
that marker smells really bad
i think smells really good
you've been doing this too long
i used to always love smelling markers
it probably became addicted to the fumes
grease paint
what else did i find
um the so make sure the da the dash the hyphen whatever you call it
is being used appropriately in cases of discontinuity um but not in stuttering like i said
and and don't use it when the utterance is clearly continued in the next segment or whatever
mm-hmm
okay
um don't transcribe in breaths or out breaths
and okay should never be um two capital letters it should be o. k. a. y.
um and one other thing is to break break up long segments if you find any
mm-hmm
so
over a minute
yeah but that's a kind of crude guideline
i'd i'd say just anything that seems unmanageable
mm-hmm
okay
so if something is a minute and three seconds i can still have it right
ah
yeah yeah
really uh it it means nothing to say a minute it's just a g a really crude guideline
mm-hmm
i would just try to keep segments very manageable um and a but u you know use these wave forms to help you
yeah b
and you can adjust the resolution so that oh
that didn't help me too much but you can use this little slide bar to adjust the resolution
actually that doesn't seem to be working
um if you just click on one of the arrows
which o
um in in the resolution thingy um it will
the arrows by the resolution
yeah on this one
yeah
no not not the other one this one
not that one
the other arrow next to it
yeah
yeah
right okay okay
oh
is that zoom in
so yeah
yeah
yeah
oh and you can also if you go to signal and
wow
um that's it's something under signal where you can adjust the amplitude as well on resolution
mm-hmm
um
oh okay right
then you can also wait
oh
no i think that's not if you go to control panel
uh-huh
signal control panel
no no signal control pan
hmm
um the vertical zoom you can adjust that as well so if it seems too flat for you or you can't really
ooh
ah right that's good
ah
okay
that might have made it s 'cause i i appear to have nothing
yeah
that's excellent
alright
but i was hearing stuff but i g there was nothing on my wave form
yeah
it's kinda hard to find where everything was
yeah
oh that's that's good to know
control panel
okay
yeah so to help you make cuts just look look f you know use this wave form and make sure you're not l losing any signal information
but um cutting segments down is a l a low priority but it it will help ultimately i think post processing wise
right
i don't
i think i've gone a bit far in cutting mine down at the moment
yeah you don't don't get excessive about it
'cause that just ends up taking too much time
mm-hmm
but i d i think from a speech recognition point of view it shouldn't matter these segments being whatever length that they happen to be
no probably not
mm
no
i've seen other p people's transcription guidelines like f for the um icsi project at berkeley and elsewhere say indicating that it really doesn't matter and it's the point is just to get 'em into manageable units
mm-hmm
okay
mm-hmm
and
easy for checking at any rate rather than having to listen to a whole anything
yeah
yeah
yeah yeah
yeah that's true actually that's the best reason for cutting them down
but hopefully the that'll be done during the first pass because that's the whole point
mm-hmm
making the checkers' job a little easier
um and then yeah just m um be sure after you've gone through the four channels to um do a search on all the unknowns
all the um cases of ambiguity or whatever
and what else was i gonna say
the way we'll be allocating this is is the same as before th it's gonna be on the th the same the same page just further down
the work allocation page
scroll down you'll see w all the files
mm
i turned the page
and uh i've already allocated some some things to be checked
so if you run out of work go ahead and start checking because this is something that's um considerably um bottle necked at the moment
okay
right
so is this the priority then
yeah i'd say for now um w we don't even have uh much new stuff to be uh to be gone over for a first pass
transcri yeah
so it's important that we d um do this second pass
and i've indicated in a column whether something is priority
mm-hmm
m i think i high typed high if it's high priority
mm-hmm
um so d those would be the ones you would focus on first obviously
and when it come you don't want to change the file name in any way
just keep it the same
um there there is going to be a checking in procedure
i don't know if anybody's mentioned this before but you'll you'll know about this with the c. v. s. server
mm-hmm
mm yeah
so th
well i don't know about i know about this for the summarisation i haven't done this with uh transcription yet
turn the page
it do yes
right but it's be s y similar
did you get the little buzz buzz
yeah
but they're they're creating a their a guy jonathan is creating a web form for you to do this all very simply and like just um upload everything that you've uh up upload the file that you've transcribed and and you'll be noting whether it's the first pass or the second pass and y your name um as the person who did that particular pass
mm-hmm
yeah
checking in page
oh right
mm-hmm
and that will happen soon
i'll let you know
so do we just open the file as we open the files for the first pass like open up the sound file and then it sh
yeah
yeah you'll have to i would suggest creating a f folder um called files to be checked or something like that
in your home directory
yeah
and then within that create a s create sub folders for the the given meeting and you'll have to get all the sound files unfortunately from the m. m. m. server on your own
okay
yep
because the the ami server's not very reliable for getting these sound files uncorrupted
so you'll have to get all the sound files from the m. m. m. server and the person's transcription file should be in that folder where you're putting yours
okay
um and then you'll just uh yeah d you'll copy that over you won't don't move it over
because we wanna have multiple versions of these things but yeah copy it into your directory and keep the same name
then you'll lose it yeah
and then when you check it in it will automatically be registered even though the the first pass was checked in when we're doing this checking in business
um it will know which pass it is but i think you'll also be indicating that as well
okay
uh it's vaguely connected question
uh-huh
um you you'll know
um originally the like when we first like replied say yes if you're interested in doing this it said six weeks
and the contracts say eighth of may which is longer in advance than which is a greater amount of time than six weeks
mm-hmm
yeah it's it' actually six what is it
is it three months i think
sh yeah someone said three months
um i've got a three month contract yeah
that's
yeah
yeah
they're they're three month contracts and now if you can't keep that that's fine
yeah
but it's just a logistic thing with personnel where where we ha that was the minimum we were able to offer a contract for
okay
right
okay that's
oh okay
so if you have to bow out let us know as soon as you know when you you're gonna have to stop
cool
right
when it gets into the holidays and we're not necessarily around in the holidays and and
mm
yeah yeah obviously those kinds of things are things we'll have to work around but um yeah it's just one of those details
right
just checking
okay
once we actually get into the like um easter holidays 'cause we're at having lectures at the moment
mm-hmm
can we be more flexible with our hours if we wanna sort of i mean depending on who's using the computers
i should think so
i mean the whole point w of keeping well as long as you're able to yeah
work out use of your computer with the other person that's fine yeah
yeah
okay
the the whole point of having m regular hours was to make sure that somebody was here to answer your questions
yeah sure
or else you can like p yes
but you've got keys so so you should be able to get in during odd hours if if you wanted to work
yes
yep
if want
and if you can plug microphones into apple appleton tower computers i can do it there as well if you wanted me
yeah yeah
yeah i don't see why not as long as you're you know doing your given set of hours for the week
okay
know what you're doing
we could meet up and have a session
yeah
and um yeah
paym i i think you'll all be paid
phew
that's a nice way to put it
i think you'll all be paid uh well have you not
i'm having sort some s i'm having to sort some tax stuff out before i can even send my stuff in
oh
mm
'cause i need to make sure i'm sending them the right form
okay
mm-hmm
okay
yeah
but they won't even know what examining board i got my a. levels in
really
yeah for human resources
i thought surely you don't need that information
'cause it took me it was about to take me half an hour well it did when i was like just going through the forms and filling in all the details
i thought i'm not going to spend w
a couple of hours getting photo copies of degree certificates to give you for your files if i'm just gonna be here a good th they won't i think it th at one place it said give us copies of degrees
no that's certainly not necessary
yeah
mm no
oh maybe i'm getting mixed up with something else but it wanted a
well it
a. level like examining board which seemed a bit ridiculous
if you have any th problems like that mm um see caroline hastings
i mean if it's for this job and and getting paid that that's not necessary and caroline hastings ought to be able to help you sort that out
right
mm
mm-hmm
yeah
yeah
didn't think so
excuse me
but j also if if pay is a matter um like if it's a matter that you haven't gotten paid for some reason
yeah
um i hope that's not not the case
yeah i haven't gotten paid for the first two weeks 'cause um i w i only have a three month contract starting february but i started mid january
mm-hmm
talk to caroline
yeah
oh
yeah 'cause i've i really don't know um why that would be
i'm here full time now so i'll i'll be here m monday through friday and i l i leave at four now
mm
alright
okay
so you won't find me anytime after that
mm-hmm
okay
alright
but
is your husband now a stay at home dad
yeah my husband's at home with the baby
wow
oh so it is your baby then on the photos
yeah yeah
one assumes this
how old now
he's uh four and half months
oh
it's very lovely
a nice jolly little baby
he's sleeping through
yeah that's the question i was just gonna ask does he sleep
yeah well um only as of friday actually
wow
so he was uh i was just telling melissa this do you want us to stop
yeah yeah
yeah
alright
yeah yeah
okay
oh good that worked out well
oh do we have to tick our note thing again when we finish this
oh yeah
absolutely
to say that we've
five years just because of the floods bringing the ceilings down
alright is it it's ready
okay great
so on its great joy
aren't they suing him
i think they probably ought to but uh they well
they've only just started realising that treating this as a legal issue is probably the right way to look at it
mm-hmm
so they're not really the sort of people that are up for understanding um the intricacies of the committee i guess
i mean i you would have thought they could but it's r it's actually quite hard work
the law isn't very clear
can't th can't they get legal aid
that's a good question
they p they uh they might be able to
it's just it's so strapped now um you know
like the citizens advice bureau is so hard to actually get access to because they've they have so many cases and so few people
so but yeah that's probably the next thing they'll have to do
hmm
mm-hmm
yeah everything's okay
are we supposed to count to ten or something
we don't have to do all that
yeah mm-hmm
okay
okay
hmm
m
mm-hmm
okay
okay okay yeah
okay
yeah
okay thanks
thank you
thank you
right
well um i thought the right thing to do was to review what wei xun's been doing in the area of dialogue structure for work package one over the last period
so basically for him to talk about what he what progress he's been making and then for us to um for hi for him to describe what work he intends over the next period of the project
and for us to figure out what help he needs with that
mm-hmm
um m maybe give him some help figuring out what publications he's gonna um get out of this and for us to make sure that it fits into the overall project
so um this is something that you know we're not gonna do everything today
but i wanted to make sure that we sort of all aligned on what he was doing at the moment and and then sort of figured out how to give him the best advice coming up
so that's that's why i called this
okay so
okay
okay thanks
yeah
you're gonna give a presentation for us then
yeah yeah a very or a quick uh slides
great
so um i've been here for fourteen month i think
yeah so i've a accustomed to the environment here and enjoy staying here
so mm uh
from uh last year i was uh uh s uh supervising the annotation of segmentation
summarisation uh uh with jean uh of the i uh ic icsi corpus and uh uh uh on the other hand uh i w n uh did s some very preliminary work on chunking the switchboard corpus
mm-hmm
mm-hmm
but uh that was not uh well picked up in the ami corpus which is supposed to be
so uh and currently i'm more interested in see uh uh yeah analysing the discourse structure in multi party meetings
this is what i'm going to present here
so uh
uh in this presentation i'm going to see how we could analyse utterance to utterance relations in multi party meetings
um
'cause meetings is a lit different from normal text or a n a normal dialogue or monologue
so interactivity is a concept is a concept that i'm using to distinguish the two uh uh extremes of uh of interac uh of discourse in meetings
and uh for dialogues uh and monologues i think we might have to use different uh concepts to m m uh model the discourse structure
then uh i w i will uh give a very uh rough plan for the next uh couple of month
and finally i i will intr i introduce some related work yeah
so
the big question that i'm concern here is what's the relationship between utterances in multi party meetings
or how do we analyse discourse structure right above utterances instead of uh those high level intentional structure of discourse
so the concern here is about the very local low level utterance to utterance relations in multi party meetings
uh this is the local discourse structure
so the uh building block of that kind of uh structure would be the uh utterance and possibly one of its properties
the dialogue act which we're currently uh working on or uh and uh for meetings
yeah so i've mentioned uh uh before that meetings is a bit different from uh monologue and uh dialogues
so uh in meetings i uh from my uh reading of the one of the ami meetings i. s. one o. eight uh the uh the four meetings
i noticed that uh uh the interaction degrees of interaction in the meetings uh varies from parts to parts
so for some part uh the interaction is very strong
so it's obviously a dialogue
but uh for some part part where the interaction is very weak uh just uh like the uh chairman or project manager is mm
uh coordinating the meeting
he's uh pushing the meeting forward then this kind of s organ organisational structure or part
uh uh and also other pr uh parts like uh the back channels without any uh semantic content uh from other participants
so this kind of uh interaction might be better analysed as monologue which uh in which there is interaction i suppose
so
i'm a little bit confused
uh-huh
so um when you say interactivity do you mean um well how would you characterise a highly interactive meeting
yeah
what are the measurements you'd apply
so you i think what you're doing is segmenting meetings into highly interactive parts and not so interactive parts
where you think some of them are like a bit like dialogue and some are a bit like monologue
yeah
yeah yeah
so what measurements would you apply to um find out which is which
so yeah so this is going to be based on the utterance to utterance
so for this utterance the next utterance if it's from another pa uh speaker
then uh if it's not a back channel or uh something similar then it's a dialogue
so if speak changes
so yeah speaker change is
so you mean relatively short turns and speaker change
yeah
yeah yeah b but uh sh short uh turns uh like mm or something very similar might be the uh seg second type of interactivity
the weak interactivity
that might not be analysed as a uh monologue but as a dial uh no no no wrong uh not as dialogue but as um a monologue
yeah
so for that part uh for that kind of back channels we can just skip that and uh uh to not treat them as interruptions or something like
s
then yeah we could just uh
so so am i right in thinking you think that you can segment meetings maybe into two t types of areas interactive and non interactive
yeah
so what are th what are the characteristics of the interactive areas
yeah
speak change speak change would be yeah
so w so okay so but you just said i think that you would characterise short turns as being the non interactive parts
if if it's uh just some kind of back channel or it's just a signal signal the s the speaker is listening or is understanding what's going on yeah
oh okay well we we can discount back channels
i mean uh c are you is it okay if we talk about this for a minute 'cause i'm confused
yeah yeah
or or do you get a c
i was just wondering if you were gonna define this more on the slides to come or if this is as much as you're gonna tell us
mm-hmm
alright
uh-huh
alright
um
i'm just wondering if he's prepared
'cause if this is all we've got
i think we should uh have interactive and non interactive on the board and then figure out what properties going to each just so we're clear what the two mean
sure
uh
so so what did you have more on later slides about this
yeah so
uh yeah
uh so for interactivity this is the only slide
so yeah activity is uh i'd define interactivity to be as a degrees of interaction in meetings
okay
well uh okay
so which might uh speak change whi uh uh would be a very good indicator yeah
but are you you need to be more precise what you mean by speaker change
mm-hmm
so y do you mean all of the speakers are involved in it
yeah yeah yeah
no no
is it sufficient for two speakers
right and then
yeah
no yeah
so actually so uh this is a very rough idea of interactivity
if we go further we might distinguish uh the interactivity between two f three or all the groups
so that might be some final definition for the uh interactivity yeah
but we've also established that it's not just speaker change it because if you have mm-hmm okay then
yeah so that might be the second class yeah
okay but that's n you can that's definitional right
weak this is a kind of weak interactivity
okay
y yeah yeah
yeah
yeah
so so i mean you wouldn't necessarily consider that to change the turns
those are just back channels
so one speaker will have the floor channel um throughout that and so i guess what you're saying is that the interactive sections would have shorter speaker turns when you're not considering the back channels as interruptions
right
yeah
mm-hmm
yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah definitely yeah
um so
well it might be the case that to be interactive there have to be dialogue acts of some specific type in a turn rather than
yeah yeah yeah that's also true
yeah
s yeah yeah actually 'cause uh i've looked uh
well do y
like statement statement reject accept you know something like that
yeah
yeah
sufficient but not necessary maybe
it depend if you had so a bunch of people all just giving information and opinion around the table and they never actually ask questions of each other
mm-hmm
okay
but the turns were actually quite short which one would it be
so for that case yeah uh yeah so this might be a weak definition of interactivity
so if we could figure out uh if they are really interacti uh interacting with each other or just uh uh incremental mm presentation of some information
mm-hmm
so that's d uh different
we might um yeah need a more strict or finer uh definition of interactivity
yeah ju uh for this use of the uh for the use of this term for the indicator of the uh degrees of interaction
uh i think for for the current uh proposal i think that it's just for distinguish between dialogues and monologues
'cause for these two types of discourse uh the uh
the the cons the the two that we are going to analyse the discourse structure might be d different
right okay
i remember you saying this before
yeah yeah
so basically you want to do the segmentation because you're going to apply completely different analyses to the two sections
yeah yeah
um
and also 'cause uh i have uh read some of the m. o. t. a. uh corpus
uh so for some part of th that kind of meetings um uh several utterances or dialogue acts are just uh tagged as statement
so that i don't think that would be very informative for high level str analysis
so that's all what uh that's why why uh i'm distinguishing the two kinds of discourse here
right
so wei xun quite takes quite a strong position on um this um difference between these two um kinds of group activities because he says that they admit different kinds of analyses
right the with the non interactive more monolo mono logic sections of the meeting um you have to uh analyse them using something akin to rhetorical structure or something
and uh with the other sections you uh um you you use some other theory to look at them
mm-hmm
and i actually uh think that that's a slightly extreme um position um with regard to the literature that a lot of people might say it doesn't really matter who the different speakers are in an interactive section
you can still um build maybe the the same argument structure over the top of the basic um acts and propositional content that's there
mm-hmm
and uh what you get is a messier version of the argument structure because not everybody has the same argument in their brain you know for this
but um but that the same theory or the the same analysis can be applied to both parts
mm-hmm
so i think it's important to keep um that in mind
and if you if you do need to argue that these two kinds of group activities uh can can only be analysed if you use different analytical mechanisms
then you have to explain why that is
okay
right so it it puts an extra burden of proof on the work that you do
well actually i don't quite agree
i mean i for example you can't use r. s. t. across speakers because the definitions of the relations depend on the intentions of the speaker and there's different speakers have different intentions
mm-hmm
mm
so you can't use the theory
it's just fundamentally wrong it's it was meant as a theory for a one person uh right
so that doesn't mean there aren't other theo so for
yeah the like yeah
right
but to the grou degree that a group is building an argument together
i mean it i think wh what you're doing in a group discussion isn't necessarily one coherent argument f for the person
but an argument that is the group view
yeah
and so it's maybe it's not r. s. t. um but it's um more akin to um i don't know is it toolman
but you know not that i but you know the kinds of things where people to try to represent argument structure
right
but those are very those are really different um theories that are at are trying to get at different things and it and they admit of m you know
some of them admit of multiple parties and some of them assume you're in one speaker's head
right and the
are are the important aspects of it for this analysis really that substantively different though
mm-hmm
yeah the entire theory is based on intention and the intention of one individual
so r. s. t. would be a bad theory to use
but i if somebody if there's been an argument so far in a group meeting
w
and um somebody makes a statement they have an intention about how to modify that group argument
so modelling modelling a single contribution by a single speaker you can within that you can use r. s. t. if you want to right
but across speakers you can't
right but but you're
they have no relations for things like reject or agree
they the theory doesn't have them
okay so the r the relation names aren't aren't right but um
so the the so it's not the right theory 'cause the theory is the relations plus the notion of nuclearity
so we need a different theory
now i think alex um s. d. r. s. allows both kinds
right
yesterday yeah
mm-hmm
might be a
so you know within a speaker turn you can have things like explanation and cause and all that
um but then across speaker turns you can have things like correction or i didn't see any examples of agree or disagree in s. t. r. s. but i there aren't
okay
yeah
no i don't think so
i mean there are thirty relations
i d
so we should look at at what they are
yeah
but i d i don't
hmm
well the relation names are less important
mm-hmm
i mean people have argued for ages about exactly what relations were in any of these theories
yeah
yes
well her the relations have a s
and that's that's less important than what the theory is trying to achieve
and it just seems to me that if you've gotta have two dif separate apparatuses for the um speaker internal um argument structure and the group argument structure
that that's more appara apparatus than you should actually need for um from doing this kind of analysis
'cause in both cases you're um building up an argument publicly in this group meeting and then you know
adding something or changing the existing argument in some way by relating a contribution to what's um already on the table
so
d yes but so i mean the relation names it's not the names that are important it's their semantics that are important right
and they're the semantics of the relations are based on the semantics of the utterances that they're relating as alex s explained yesterday
mm
yeah yeah
um and so um it is important that these relations have a semantics that's tied to the semantics of the utterances right
yeah c i just think well i mean it all of these things when they encounter a new genre of um of uh actual data
then they end up modifying building new kinds of relations with new kinds of semantics and adding them
uh p poss possibly but few people have tried to you know
that's the entire history of these
do the kind of um truth conditional semantics that you know asher and lascarides have done right
yeah
mm-hmm
so the theory can handle the kinds of things that happen in meetings as she explained
the actual computational mechanisms they have currently for building up the trees can't
now i don't remember was which speaker you in the c in the example she showed yesterday
mm-hmm
was it the case that the representation of the utterances and the relations included which speaker was uh
no just a uh turn exchange yeah
i mean it had the at the l at the leaves they had the well she didn't show it but they would have the semantics of the utterances
mm-hmm
and then she had relation names and handles
yeah
actually sh uh she used some a a a bunch of features to do the automatic parsing
right
i just i just don't didn't remember seeing in the representation which speaker contributed what
mm-hmm
'cause she did represent um discourse structures 'cause these were the verbmobil scheduling dialogues
hmm
mm-hmm
mm-hmm yeah
so the utterances in the in the representation were uttered by two different parties that wasn't the you know
mm-hmm
in the in the examples she showed us there were there was some that was just you know one party
yeah
it was a monologue but then there was a snippet of dialogue as well with
right
so there you've got somebody who's doing theoretical development that would claim that you don't need two separate an analytical frameworks for these two types of activities that wei xun has identified
for this specific set of relations that that they've defined
yeah
there might be some higher level structure that you wanna pull out of that
mm-hmm
i mean i 'cause you were saying you're just gonna you you're you wanna look at this you know very local stuff
uh yeah
utterance to utterance yeah
very low level yeah
but from that you c one would hope you would pull out something high you know
you cou yeah
yeah i to uh just we need to see uh how well we could work out of the utterance to utterance
no i think working from the bottom up sounds great
but i'm just y i mean what you can imagine someone saying well how did they decide to make it blue
yeah
and maybe there was a long blow by bl and you don't you kind of wanna abstract away from he said this
she said that he sai you know to anyway i you know i mean i i don't think especially uh
yeah
so uh yeah
you know if you're not steeped in these theories that it makes a huge difference to you whether we use r. s. t. or something like s. d. r. s.
but it might make much more you know i mean
yeah
i just prefer it to be one thing rather than two completely separate things and then the added explanation of why it's not possible to have the same thing applied to both halves
well i think we should ass i think we should
try to find a theory that allows multiple speakers and relations to span over more than one spea you know
mm-hmm
yeah
because it is true that i mean if you look at things like damsel and other attempts to come up with annotation schemes for for dialogue acts
there was this notion of forward looking and backward looking
anyway they're relational
i mean in some way you know they're all relational
hmm yeah
um but you needed
but there's a different set of tags in there from the kinds of relations you see within r. s. t. for example
mm-hmm
so if you look at amanda stent's thesis and the analysis that she did sort of within a turn she used something like r. s. t.
mm-hmm
and then across turns she used damsel right
yeah which wouldn't probably wouldn't give us the kind of um information that we need about relations across turns
just because we really are critically interested in the argument um that the group is building up so that we can find the decisions that they made and um any p uh counter proposals to proposals that have been made and things
i mean it really is more in the spirit uh of the r. s. t. ish relations than um than in the damsel kinds of relationships
what we want uh out of the c um the relationships between speakers here
they are jointly building up an argument structure
and that is the critical thing that we're missing in order to be able to um understand what's happening in these meetings
so we wouldn't we wouldn't wanna do the same thing as what um she did in this case
well i
bec just because um damsel doesn't give you the right sort of representation between speakers
well it gives you things like accept and reject and
oh does it
okay um i haven't seen it on that this kind of data
oh yeah
so maybe
in fact r. s. t. doesn't give you anything like that
no
right okay but are what i mean is you kno wanna make sure you get the argumentative relations however you do it
hmm-hmm
okay
whichever relations you have to build you know
right
not i'm not saying i'm not saying that there's a particular set of tags or relations that have been defined out there that are the right ones
right
i'm just saying we need the correct ones for th the structure that we're trying to get out of this
'cause we need certain information out of this analysis
right okay
d so i think it's much more impor i think it would make more sense to go about this problem figuring out what kinds of relationships we want and then finding and
that
yeah
you know like setting down what the constraints are on the analysis game
well wei xun's been looking at the data
so that's that's a step for this
he's been looking at the data okay s to good
mm-hmm
um and then and then there are lots of different theories of argument
i mean you can also think about the sort of joint problem solving kinds of um approaches
yeah
yeah yeah
yeah
so you know clark and lockbaum and you know that that kind of thing
yeah
mm-hmm
mm-hmm
that were designed for dialogue right i mean and can be expanded to more than two persons
mm-hmm
actually the lockbaum stuff is for groups
mm-hmm yeah
yeah yeah yeah
so yeah for interactivity this is a very weak definition yeah
if we need more then we might use some more finer uh f finer uh definition for interactivity
well what you'll need in the end is something operational
yeah
so it's something that you can use to actually segment meetings into the um the areas that you think are important for this analysis right
yeah
so um it's not quite clear to me what the different kinds of things are
okay
so it would be i think handy if you could take a meeting at some point and say you know
this is a interactive area and this is a mono logic area because and we could come up with what kinds of measurements you need
um i mean we have w we haven't done past work here on segmenting meetings in that way
but we have done work on characterising different kinds of meetings um in terms of how highly interactive they are
but it's a different definition right
it's in terms of how much all of the people involved in the meeting um take some take equal part in it as opposed to um like the highest state is people in the meeting just driving it and and uh the other people following whatever the high state is people want
so um but those kinds of measures um you know
yeah
we could use to um to do this kind of segmentation if it's important to the analysis right
yeah okay
w but we need clearer definitions of what the different things are how many different kinds of of um activities are there
you know is it just interactive and non interactive or is there are there there more grades of shading than that
mm-hmm
and um you know what are the things that you expect in each
what's the back channelling behaviour
what's the speaker turn um you know what kind of dialogue acts do you expect
i think that would help you pin down what the definitions are
yeah okay
so mm so for dialogue yeah mm there would be uh some kind of uh interaction structure
so it for uh in previous discourse studies uh especially in discourse analysis exchange uh is used to describe this kind of uh local structure
and in conversation the analysis so adjacency pairs are used to describe this kind of structure
uh
but uh in these two strands or work they uh just come up with a list maybe not uh exhaustive
so uh i'm been think about uh if we could come up with some kind of more principal scheme uh taking some of the uh information in the uh uh uh in the uh interaction uh into account
like uh is the small part of interaction is is exchanging some information
uh here information is a little vague
it could be some kind of knowledge what the uh speaker knows or or some kind of thought what the speaker is thinking
so these two kind of uh inform mm two kinds of the information uh might be some kind of a difference
so this is a little bit like the bell's mm exchange of information uh for the knowledge
if exchange of uh opinion uh uh some kind of so it's uh very related to thought of thinking yeah
do you think it matters whether something is knowledge or opinion in the way it contributes to the group process
uh in some case it s differs 'cause uh when we exchange knowledge we might not challenge uh the speaker
but uh when the speaker is uh pre uh is uh talk about what he feels what he thinks
is proposing something or s uh then other speakers might might chan challenge him or her
yeah
so that kind of structu
i i sort of have always taken the view that um that well people aren't very good at at this kind of rationality you know
yeah
yeah
and the difference between information and opinion isn't that prominent in the way people do their reasoning
so um
yeah
but uh that might b be some difference inter interaction par patterns
might be
'cause uh for information if we uh somebody's uh seeking some information then he uh ask some question and uh the one knows will uh gives gives the answer
but uh uh for the uh opinion or thought uh stuff
then the speaker might just uh uh present some idea and others will comment or uh challenge uh the idea
yeah
well you you can't define 'em that way
you can't define the difference between information and opinion that way because that's um basically defining as the what happened about it
mm-hmm
okay
and i think what tends to happen is that um if people challenge the the facts
mm-hmm
you often discover that they weren't actually solid facts anyway you know that they're i think the boundary between these is kind of fluid
yeah
yeah it's vague yeah
yeah yeah yeah
so i guess the question is is it important to what what's it important to
so do you need the difference between information and opinion to do this analysis
mm see 'cause uh so far i'm s still looking for a uh so called principal scheme for the interaction uh for the interaction
so
so what have you been looking at
yeah i was just gonna say it would be useful to know what m
yeah so
yeah
so you're you've got books that high on your desk
yeah
which ones are they
yeah so yeah for uh p uh the discourse analysis they're using exchange
but uh they have no uh no classification just to come up with okay so uh you mean uh
but who's they
that's the question
who
uh sinclair and coulthard
that is
right
also at geneva school they i don't think they list some kind of exchange
but uh the uh exchange structure uh and uh yeah exchange is first uh developed in uh systemic functional grammar along the uh uh halliday and and martin's work
mm-hmm
mm-hmm
yeah
so uh actually they they have some something in in a textbook about the exchange
uh they call it negotiation
so they have uh some flow charts of the uh uh detailed analysis of uh uh exchange structure yeah
mm
okay
so y um i'm sort of getting that you think there is a lack in the uh theory to do with exchange structure at the moment
yeah
but i'm but i'm not quite clear yet what you think the lack is
so
so um uh i don't think there is any kind of principle classification of exchanges
this is i yeah w
um the well are you thinking it's been a while since i've read this literature
mm-hmm
but i mean my understanding of exchange is is that the initiating move introduces a goal to the discourse
mm-hmm
and then the remaining moves um will uh contribute to either the um the meeting of that discourse goal or the decision not to bother with that discourse goal
right
and so um i'd be surprised if there wasn't work describing
okay
mm
things in those terms
i mean i know sinclair and coulthard is is basically about teaching yeah
yeah i. r. f. uh kind of structure
yeah yeah yeah
so you wouldn't expect that to necessarily um apply uh in in wider contacts in a way
like you might expect to have to extend the theory to do that
but i th i think there are other other people have looked at exchange structure and described it in these terms in a way that should really suit your needs
okay
mm 'cause uh from my previous experience we see ananys analysis of information seeking dialogues over telephones
mm-hmm
so it's um uh about the tourism information
so from uh um my analysis of that kind of dialogues i could say that there's only there only four basic uh exchanges depend on the information uh direction of the information flow
yeah
mm-hmm
mm-hmm
and also the speaker role
'cause in the information seeking dialogues the uh t roles of the two participants are different
one is mainly the uh from the uh agency a tourism agency
that is main uh uh information provider uh while the customer is the information seeker mainly
mm-hmm
yeah that's uh so theref uh and also mm uh the direction of information flows for some kind of information
like uh the uh uh price of a specific route
uh the spots they're going to uh visit and also on the uh kinds of uh ve uh vehicle or or transportation yeah
yeah
so this is a l a lot like george horton's work on saying what are the different parameters for um these exchanges
uh-huh
yeah yeah yeah
yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
you know what are the things that characterise the set of exchanges that can happen
yeah yeah s yeah yeah
mm
so but there also some variations which i call complex exchanges
so that's uh that's uh just a list
mm not like the uh basic exchange uh exchanges yeah
so so is your complaint less about um less about knowing what makes an exchange and more about knowing how you parameterise exchanges for this genre
so what's the range
yeah yeah
okay so you're worried about what's the range of exchange types for this genre and that's what you think hasn't been done
yeah yeah parametri yeah i i i'm looking for parametric yeah scheme
uh-huh
okay
that's clearer
yeah yeah yeah
that's uh y yeah
a parame parameter or principle
yeah some something like
yeah
mm-hmm
yeah
and also yeah
a and also s in 'cause in the meetings uh the speakers might might report something uh they've done in the past and uh uh uh uh talk about th what they are currently doing and also planning some future actions
so this kind of information might also be helpful
yeah
so so have have you tried i mean um i know of one previous attempt to establish what exchanges are needed for f um some kinds of industry meetings
mm-hmm
and our experience in that project was that um you can't really identify exchange structures in these meetings because they they don't really follow that pattern
mm-hmm
that exchanges are clear in um well i there're clearer in when you've got fewer people
so there's fewer people trying to pull the discourse goals in different directions
yeah
um and they're clearer when um your goals are quite limited
so when you've just got information exchange and you know the or there's a clear task that the people are trying to do and they're focussed on that task
as is normal in dialogue elicitation like map task or like your
like your informa which like your information seeking dialogues which wasn't dialogue elicitation but it was very constrained in genre
yeah yeah
so um the the answer to the question might be nobody knows what the catalogue of exchanges is for real meetings because um or for these decision making meetings because you can't identify exchanges
mm-hmm
right
so have you gone through the meetings and looked for initiations and responses with without a prior catalogue
just knowing that init initiation in introduces a new discourse goal and a response um meets or negates that goal in some way
yeah
so have you tried marking these exchanges
uh not marking
just uh for my uh reading of the uh i. i. s. one o. eight uh four meeting series
mm-hmm
yeah just to reading this part yeah
mm
well i mean i think that um w it i don't know uh w it'd probably get to re hear you know
more of your presentation because i think there are lots of different candidates and you certainly can't go through and mark up every meeting
mm-hmm
i mean mark up meetings with every scheme we think of
so i think we have to kind of get an overview of what the candidates are m if there's like two or three that we think are good contenders
yeah
then we try to see what works better right
yeah
but but a reading of this you know
th could tell you that there is no case where you're gonna be looking for initiation and responses that's gonna work you know
'cause you could go through and see that um actually the pattern of of addressing different discourse goals is too dispersed to um to be able to do that kind of mark up
but i g yeah i mean i obviously you wanna have a front runner scheme i in mind before you
there are a lot of option there are a lot more options
so so let's see what what else you've got
okay
so this is for the uh dialogue part
for monologues uh this is uh yeah
so that's it
oh so that was it on dialogue okay
yeah
okay so no further uh information is here
okay
uh
so uh it's very unclear to me why you think exchange of information is more principal t uh did you i mean what did you have specific schemes in mind there
or spec mm specific
uh
people's work that you um
mm 'cause uh so for the information and action the uh the action here is not dialogue act but uh some kind of uh uh physical action uh that uh the uh participant's uh i i is going to uh or has done in the past
he's going to do the future
do you mean an action in terms of what the group is requiring him to do or do you mean an action in like picking something up
so
uh not
so action in the technical meeting sense or just action in the physical sense
physical sense yeah
right okay
physical sense yeah
yeah so uh this kind of might be the uh some kind of semantics of the utterance or or exchange
so uh this is just one um thing i one parameter uh for mm-hmm
but can you give us an example of a scheme that's based on exchange of information
uh
i mean uh here the scheme is for exchange scheme
so yeah for uh for for uh exchange of information
okay
so there might be the uh s speaker and he uh a hearer
so who speaks to whom and uh uh
s so this is the uh uh so direction of the information flow and also so speaker role might be first uh parameters for the uh ex uh information exchanges
mm-hmm
so um but for action that might be uh some kind of uh propose or accept or reject kind of uh uh exchange structure i mean
oh so that's not a physical action right
uh uh if i pick this up which is a physical action you can't reject that
uh-huh
uh no no
what do you mean
no that's uh that's the uh
so we're going to do something and uh uh so could you do something or this kind of uh action related utterance i mean
right
yeah
that's right that's a action in the sort of technical sense of meetings
okay technical sense
so you are actioned to do something which is part of the permanent record that yeah okay
yeah
yeah
yeah yeah yeah yeah
okay yeah yeah
okay yeah that's n
hmm
okay so i mean i think that um there are a lot of things that we have to look at before i mean
before come up with the scheme you mean
yeah
yeah
i mean and
well there are very few uh schemes for marking up exchanges on actual data right because um people haven't considered it very important
exch
well i always thought they get tired after marking up the dialogue moves so they nev never bother with any higher level dialogue structure
so we did it in the map task
but i don't actually know of other cases where people bothered marking anyth anything higher level than the map than the move structure
right
so yeah
well we're marking up a lot of higher level things in our
you don't know of
uh yeah
s stent yeah stent might does um yeah
on yeah i've s uh sorry
stent yeah
um but it c it's not been very popular car probably 'cause it makes um
mm no
okay
so um have you looked at nate blaylock's work
uh so so 'cause i'm i might not familiar with these na
so he has things like you know adopt um so basically it's to
you know collaborative problem solving you know more than one person involved and trying to characterise things as um
mm-hmm
you know if i
i can't remember the i can't remember the names of all the actions
so uh is it the work uh described in the c uh in in uh in the coconut project or something similar
no so so the coconut project is a project that i did with rich thomasson and barbara diginio
yeah yeah yeah yeah
have you looked at that
y yeah look uh not very much detail yeah
not very clear
no
though there's a lot of detail in the paper
yeah
but you haven't looked at it no in very much detail
no not
okay so i think you should
okay
um because it was all these things that are done for joint problem solving and joint action i think are very relevant to look at because these people are solving a problem together
yeah
right
so um while these schemes may not have they have some es of the essential components that you need to characterise um joint problem solving
so while th um
you may think that they're missing something then we we could certainly augment them
but i think that they have to be looked at
and so so nate blaylock tried to okay so you know
from gross and krauss and gross and sidener came all this stuff about shared plans and how you really can't understand
you know dialogue u unless you understand shared plans
but the actual theoretical um or formalisation of it was incredibly complex
yes yes
and so um lockbaum simplified it quite and you know sidener and rich and collagen have simplified it quite a bit
um but nate blaylock tried to um you know define
you know what happens after somebody suggests something
well you can adopt it you can well i can't remember you know okay but he has uh he has a taxonomy yeah right
yeah i know okay
oh
uh i know this guy yeah yeah
uh jim's student
yeah i know
yeah yeah
no no in saa saarbruecken
yeah yeah
yeah exactly right
okay
yeah yeah yeah
okay
yeah i know her
um which we tried to apply to tutoring but it actually doesn't work very well for tutoring 'cause tutoring's just a totally different ball game
different
okay
but um it you know
we spent a fair amount of time looking at it and it did strike me that for joint problem solving there w there were some good ideas
and there is you know a set of tags and what they mean and you know that sort of thing
and then you can also look at you know cl you know clark on joint action
now he's not gonna give you a set of tags 'cause that's not the kind of guy he is
no
but um
but the overarching idea you know
i mean i think accounts for a lot of the ways in which um you know these other people are thi are thinking
mm-hmm
but i mean i think that we we basically have to merge some of this stuff that's been done you know
on meetings with some of the stuff that's been done on collaborative problem solving 'cause there's elements of each that seem really important
mm-hmm yeah
and i think th
well the first step is find out in the what how much of the material does the collaborative problem solving cover
so how much of a genre clash is there here
because it really seems to me that you know if you look at and some of this stuff on exchange is like ancient and you know
they didn't have the ability to mark up lots of data and count things you know
so i mean all the conversational analysis stuff i mean those guys never count anything you know
no
i mean they're uh ps so they see a pattern and then they think it's kinda cute and then they scour the world for third turn repairs you know
they don't actually say how often do those happen
well it's
i mean they worked i mean i know manny schegloff really well and they're not counters
they're purposely not counters
they define themselves as non counters
yeah
b th but there there are people in the field that are moving that direction like martin
mm-hmm
and also what's important here is the theoretical clarity about what an initiation and a response is
so what is it that ties um different acts together at a higher level you know
mm-hmm
yeah th i mean it it does seem like you know
there's something that we want from that and then there's something that we want from collaborative problem solving
mm-hmm
and
if you l if you take the exchange stuff it's not gonna d quite do everything you want
and if you look at the collaborative problem solving stuff maybe it won't do every that you want
and so
but i think more important than looking at um whether parts of the meeting are highly interactive or not so interactive is uh looking at what sort of task the people are trying to do at the moment
so you know
are they doing um uh i are are they uh i as in the kick off meeting just exchanging information to get started with a project or are they uh actually addressing some specific design um criteria at the moment
should try to decide which shape the thing is
um because that's going to affect the kinds of relations that you get between the utterances
and so that is much more like um the um the literature from mcgrath about the different kinds of activities groups get into
yeah
so i think that's another thing that has to be pulled into this because um you you do require different uh uh different kinds of relations
hmm
or you expect different kinds of relations from some over arching set in um those different kinds of activities
yeah
uh
so main actions i guess might be some some high level uh problem solving or decision making uh uh concepts
uh not like the exchange which which i i would like to be very low level utterance to utterance relations
um so what's the high level version again
p s
uh i mean uh i mean the m main actions might be some it might be yeah built built
meeting action
right okay
i mean i the meeting actions is just gonna be a segmentation
it's not going to present any s any micro structure
okay so well w
so it's just gonna say from here to here they're doing something
that's all that that scheme is gonna do
okay
like somebody's writing on the white board or i mean the w meeting actions they presented at the review seemed really low level to me like somebody stood up
okay
w
it's n
that's not no those well that's individual actions
okay
physical
some kind of physical actions yeah
and the meeting actions are meant to b uh become more um semantic and more theoretical than the kind idiap have traditionally used
okay
okay
so so we need to still preserve some uh sense of the activity
okay
but rather than saying it is somebody's at the white board it'll be you know that somebody's explaining something that the others are focussed on
okay
okay
i mean i i realise it's important to recognise that you know what wei xun got up and went to the white board
i realise that's important you know
yeah
but i d was kind of surprised that those meeting actions
yeah different scheme yeah
so yeah mm okay
it's it's a different scheme
yeah
so yeah uh th the the main actions that uh you're talk about i think might be yeah built up from the exchange yeah
ex at least exchange might be uh one kind of uh important information for that kind of
mm-hmm
well you might need the meeting action segmentation in order to know where what uh what area you're circumventing for so
it's just exchange structure in this area that you're looking at and then that's a solid boundary between the next bit or something
i don't know
yeah
um but w well time's getting on
yeah okay
so you know what practical things can we do to help this work move forward
so y show what else
next
you're you're thinking about yeah
yeah
so yeah for the monologue i've i have not uh looked into the details about the this kind of uh relations for the monologue parts
just a list of these uh relations
and uh so uh next i need to uh review the literature and uh come up with s schemes for the real data annotation
mm-hmm
and after that uh we w 'cause this mm is not in the hub corpus
so we are not going to get l all the meetings annotated with that kind of
mm-hmm
mm-hmm
so uh so we we might ju first try a few meetings and uh have a reliability study
if it's reliable enough
then we must just uh just annotate a small part of the meetings and using some learning techniques to boot boot strap the uh uh automatic uh analyser
well m marking up exchange structure if if it's there and if um if you've got a working scheme for it is relatively cheap
mm-hmm
it's a lot cheaper than doing dialogue act coding in the first place
yeah if uh if it's based on the uh um dialogue acts yeah
um right well one presumes it is otherwise it's gonna be ra radically expensive to do any kind of mark up
mm-hmm
so um the you know it's something that we can look at but you need to what we need it's more important than knowing
you know that we need exchange structure marked up on x. amount of data at this point is knowing um where you're headed with this i think
so what's the good that that uh the project gets out of this in the end
so you know what's the w what's the headline results of the work on the project
i think is is what we're trying to get a sense of here
hmm
yes
so you get your exchange structure marked up
and say we just put in the money get exchange structure marked up on that entire hub or you know
figure out how to boot strap it so we we get this um uh how do you how do you sell that as a as a project goal you know
'cause people are gonna say exchange structure so what
hmm
what do wh what do you what how do you plug that into the rest the stuff right
or fits the meeting browser
yeah
yeah
okay so mm
this might not be
the final goal that uh that could be fit into the uh browser
but it uh might be some kind of uh uh information which might benefit meeting actions or some more high level decision making or problem solving
mm-hmm
'cause this is the building blocks i guess yeah
so
yeah
see 'cause i think that um just to make this m more efficient
mm-hmm
you should be thinking about the high level goal in order to focus the work that you're doing rather than thinking well
yeah
you know there's these theories you know how can we apply these theories to it
um and then seeing what comes out of that that might be useful for the meeting browser actually trying to say yeah
okay
we have a goal of being able to do this with the meeting browser um what kinds of dialogue structure would we need to be able to do that
mm-hmm
i mean uh i don't know maybe you'd wanna disagree with that
but i this more goal directed might actually make it easier to um bring these things to publication in the long run right
well i think we should approach it both ways
i mean uh you know i i d
you know the meeting browser people have a lot of constraints
and so what they end up with saying is most critical for them right now might not be the most interesting thing in the longer term
right
and so
it's not necessarily what they say
but it's something at least identify something that we'd hope to get out of it you know
right
i mean people have said over and over again that they would like to understand how a decision has evolved right
mm-hmm
um and i think that
well i don't know if all of this low level stuff would allow you to track that kind of thing
but it might at least be the building blocks of allowing you to track that kind of thing and
yeah yeah
so after this if uh if uh uh we might do some mm pe uh from here we might be some uh uh
yeah some higher level yeah
yeah c problem solving decision making process to track that kind of information
yeah
yeah
so i mean i think it's clear that something at this level needs to be there
i mean and to ask questions like who disagreed or were there any counter proposals or whatever
even those kind of questions you need some kind of mark up like this
i it just helps you know which theory you should be concentrating on
so you know that immediately discounts exchange um structures that are mostly for information seeking alone because the notion exchange is to restrict it there
and in favour of um these these more argumentative things
so i mean uh i do think you should keep in mind what the final goal is so that you can plug this into something at the end and and um show some benefit of having the mark up
yeah
well that brings up something interesting because i think probably what we should do is try to get
you know some of these
tasks sort of put on you know sort of as part of the official agenda
so being able to answer questions like um were there any counter proposals to the bana you know banana shape or whatever
um uh or to some specific you know recommendation and things like that
mm-hmm
i mean you know those you know strike me as cl clear things that you know
people who go to decision making meetings want to know if they've missed one or are arriving late or anything like that
yeah
so it wou it seems like we should probably get some of these things on the official agenda and say look
you know wouldn't it be nice if you could have answers to these questions or something
yeah
i mean operationally it's not gonna much difference whether it's hub or not right because
we've got the bank of people
oh
we have to get the hub stuff through but um you know he's n not ready with an annotation scheme that can be used at the moment anyway
so and it it's not that expensive
no m so
i mean it's something that we can afford off budget 'cause
and i think we wouldn't wanna necessarily do this on icsi data
i think the icsi data is too too complex and there aren't enough real decisions made you know that you could clearly identify
messy
yeah it uh and it's too different a genre yeah
yeah yeah
hmm
mm-hmm
i mean there are some but and not that i've read more than about two meetings
mm
ye yeah
but um i think w it you know w well so one thing that's gonna be interesting is the i think to me
yeah
is the um what can you do because presumably the um d. f. k. i. folk or somebody is gonna mark up a lot of the data with sort of tags about ontology
right
mm-hmm
mm-hmm
so we know you know somebody will have gone and by hand and sort of marked up som something l like shallow semanticy kinds of things right
or maybe deeper semanticy things but that but you know
yeah that's not help either
but yeah they're sure to do that
not really in a in a formal language but mostly just you know tags right
um and then the question is well how does you know
just the way people typically do this is you know
let's take these semantic features into or these features into account and see how well we do with the the learning
and then let's throw these features out and see how well we do um because we know we're gonna have them
because one or two sides is really intr are really interested in this ontology stuff right
i mean t. n. o. is and d. f. k. i. is right
mm-hmm
mm-hmm
so there will be some kind of domain semantics
and there will also be presumably some kind of task hierarchy modelling going on in i mean 'cause the whole browser working group um final um sort of presentation on that second day was about
in the m
you know knowing the task right
mm-hmm
and very you know details about which task is this you know
which sub task is this little chunk of the meeting addressing and furthering in various ways right
y
which seems like it would be really hard in an open domain
um well i don't remember that about the w i mean the
you remember when steve came in steve whittaker came in at the end and said you know
they'd spent the morning talking and they came up with this idea
um
oh but that was about what task the person doing the browsing was gonna do
mm
it w they didn't say anything about what sort of information they'd want from the meeting itself
it w it was about uh i
they just mention that they want decision um for issues action items
i think they are more talking about um user requirement for the meeting than soft text they want to know
no they said people are talking about tasks you know
what happened happening in a meeting
i mean they really they made it clear that they were that that was gonna be heavily
that was the that we the browser task
you know they've identified these seven different tasks people might wanna do with browsers um you know
like uh join a meeting late and ch um catch up on what's happened in the meeting so far be at home waiting for the washing repair guy
no those are the s those are the scenarios
and
they say that
those are the user scenarios
the task what what he came back and said that at the end
yeah
i mean it actually kind kind of scared me because it was all based around tasks
okay well c maybe
and and the domain tasks okay they're now they now have to decide how many buttons to put on this thing
i mean it was all about the domain task
okay
and it is really the it and given that
uh it it's really scary to think about what you could possibly do in an open domain where you don't where you don't know what the tasks are
and i don't think you're gonna be able to figure them out uh very reliably
mm-hmm
but i thought you wanted to avoid doing stuff that was s stuck in this particular domain if possible
but you know th they weren't concentrating
i do but the whole project is you know focussed on ami hub data as their first priority
well yeah
but that doesn't mean you have to be um using the techniques that you can be using open domain techn
n no no no no no
but i mean if the if the if they had th they had this sort of epiphany at the end of this meeting where they decided well why are people browsing this
well it's all to see how you know how the participants were furthering their tasks
mm-hmm
and you don't think that can be done in open domain at all
'cause we don't wanna get into um working with ontologies
i mean one of the strengths of this grouping was that yeah they all work with the closed domain ontologies and we'll do the open domain side of things
so
i don't know
well right
and then yes
we'll see
and then there was this confusion about the um last spider phone conference that the messages telling people to call came out after the meeting happened
at least to some of us
oh right yeah
so we don't know what happened at that one
yeah
so um i mean we'll we'll get that back on track
but i think that um we don't you know there will be some meeting browser demo that um
you know i i think it's an interesting question of okay well if you have knowledge here's what you can do
if you don't have that knowledge
mm-hmm
you have to do different things and you know you can't necessarily
yeah
so you're advising wei xun that he should be using like any ontologies and propositional content that um d. f. k. i. and t. n. o. bank in the c. v. s. repository or or not
yeah ma ma uh s
well i think when he does re when he does lear these learning experiments he should do 'em two ways
that's what i'm not clear on
mm-hmm
because he will have this opportunity with or without
with our without
mm-hmm
and then we can see like well without you know these tags so you know
yeah that's kind of uh
okay
alex was showing um yesterday well without knowing the head word of the utterance at the leaf
you know you get these kinds of results and when you add that in you get these other kinds of results
yeah yeah yeah
and you know i think yeah
different feature combination yeah
um so i think if we have those features it's you know
it's a rare orp or rare opportunity that you can you know you can try one head to head against the other
can actually try
mm-hmm
yeah
um and then of course to make sure that you really um
i don't know when they'll bank these by the way
um 'cause that's it's not hub
so i it's one of these things where everybody's supposed to bank as many things as possible
right
so you know w
well we won't i mean we won't use 'em till they're ready obviously
so we might do the sort of open domain
i mean a although it will be a closed domain i mean we we can't use any domain information necessarily
yeah
but open
uh
i mean there probably are a bunch of issues like if you've got a hundred hours of meetings and they all talk about a lot of the same things
yeah it's not really an open domain task yeah
then it's ea it it's not really open domain and somehow that sneaks into all the statistics anyway 'cause you don't have such a wide vocabulary and you know
well eventually the hub is supposed to be forty percent non scenario
right
but that data's definitely gonna be kind of coming in the last
so
sure so we might find that when we move from what we thought was open domain but on the hub
you know our results go down when we truly are getting meeting yeah
mm-hmm
yeah
that's quite reasonable
so i mean that'll be interesting
w we've got five isca meetings actually which are still uh an elicitation task but they're not our domain
so that should help some
okay well that's good
and they've been declared hub
so so they'll accrue all of the normal an annotations
of course yeah you'll you'll never get the t. n. o. and d. f. k. i. stuff on it 'cause they're only billing stuff for the one to make the
so okay
so we wanna decide um what wei xun should do next and maybe think about meeting in i don't know a month or something
yeah just figure out how we're gonna help him to to try to make this more efficient
yeah mm-hmm
um so before we do that can i just ask you a question about chunking
yeah yes
in the beginning you said something about you were doing this chunking um and you're doing it on the icsi data
but this was did you say it th wasn't picked up in ami or you i i i was confused about w
uh uh yeah
yeah
uh i mean i was supposed to chunk uh some part of the ami meetings
you know to see if the chunker channel switchboard works well enough or not
mm-hmm
if not then mm we have to use some kind of semi superv supervised learning or some uh boot strapping to to to do the chunking
mm-hmm
and you and you haven't done it yet
no no 'cause i was a bit worried about uh this kind of uh discourse structure yeah
tha that's fine
so that's still on the agenda to do at some point
yeah
yeah but we should make sure we finish that off because otherwise that work's just wasted right
yeah
exactly
yeah
we're gonna use chunks for something useful
that's
okay
yeah chunks are gonna be named entities if nothing else
well so i mean right
um or building blocks
i mean so i mean we have to think about how s chunking interacts with the automatic segmentation you know
because um barbara was showing the low level
automatic segmentation at which level
uh dialogue segmentaton
uh-huh
dialogue act yeah
yeah okay
and i mean it seems to me that chunking should have some kind of so if if your dialogue act segmenter says there's there's a segment here
yeah
but your chunker said no
this is a coherent chunk then y y you know w i mean maybe they could work together to do a better job than
yeah and that's a problem
yeah
certainly if if you've got chunks it ought to help you know where your dialogue act boundaries better not be
right
yeah
yeah
mm-hmm
mm-hmm
and it may be even more mechanical than that based on the um examples we're seeing from d. f. k. i.
mm-hmm
'cause they're they're hand marking stuff and the dialogue act boundaries are supposed to be intentional
um but they seem to always be marking them that um uh after verbs you know with clause m uh it's very it looks quite mechanical
periods
oh after uh right
hmm
mm-hmm
so we're querying them about this because that's not the way they're supposed to be doing it
okay
right okay
and
good
so it sounds like well w
well hold on
but when do we need chunking by
and it you know so y i don't like the idea that you know
you start something and then eighteen months later you pick up to do the last ten percent of the work to finish it off or whatever
so it i like things kinda tidy
right
so how much work is there left and when do we actually need it by would be useful to discuss
well how much ami
well you wanted to do the chunking on the ami data right
yeah
because m
the ami data is is there
there's i mean there's hub set a. is transcribed i think um in final form
you we can check the wikis
but you know the data is rolling in
so
so we got stuck at some point on evaluation of chunking right
the problem was you didn't have icsi data that was hand labelled for chunks
or ami data
n no
and we decided labelling the icsi data for chunks would be probably difficult and maybe not very useful
and so it it mi
and but barbara still says somebody's done this for chunks
okay
i'll have to look up you know so
so
okay if there if there was if there was hand labelled data that you could evaluate again so train on some and evaluate on some
wouldn't that um 'cause you've trained on switchboard right where there there are chunks
mm-hmm
so if you had some icsi data that you could maybe use i don't know
yeah
um as a what's the n there's t there's a training set and then there's the development set and then there's the test set
maybe you'd use some chunked icsi stuff as development or something and do some last tweaks and then evaluate
mm-hmm
mm
but you know w h i mean i can see why wei xun didn't wanna spend his time chunking icsi d
which means we have to get some portion of the data hand chunked
hand chunked
mm-hmm
but
that shouldn't be that hard to do right
how much data do you need
how much um well
i don't read lips
what was that
was it hard
how much
in switchboard
switchboard is all chunked
yeah
yeah
right
they the data how much data you need was not a problem with the switchboard 'cause he had lots
so he didn't have to think about how much
so we need to know how much data you need hand chunked
right
well
and then uh how do you hand chunk stuff right
so you were were working on instructions for doing hand chunking
mm
no you had penn tree bank parses and you made chunks from that
for switchboard yeah
but then he there were two possible options for uh for doing this on the ami data
yeah yeah for switchboard yeah
you could either um essentially go the same route as they did with the switchboard um you know
do the penn tree bank and then create the chunks off that or you could chunk directly
mm-hmm
and it wasn't clear to us which one of those two methods was the right way to do this
direct chunking 'cause we are not going to in a tree out of the ami data
right well so you'd have to produce as part of this exercise
is anybody gonna parse
is any gonna try to anybody try to parse the ami data
you would've thought so but i dunno
uh so th uh we uh d. f. k. i. 'cause they're working on some h. p. s. g. parsing
oh yes yeah i'd forgotten about that
mm-hmm
yeah might be
might be yeah
if the
but that's not very similar
well i don't know very much about grammar
is th is that similar enough that that this same method could apply that we derive chunks off the h. p. s. g. output
uh if uh i'm i guess that if they're different then we might just uh write another script to do the translation
i think you might lose a lot in you know this step
so basically your your chunker is trained on something that was derived off penn tree bank
mm-hmm
and it might be different enough that that actually causes it not to match
you know if you're suddenly evaluating against chunks that were done using h. p. s. g. i don't know about grammar but it you know it
okay
yeah yeah
i need to look at some of to see
well they're using the e. r. g. right
the which probably has a l maybe finer g uh which i believe has finer grained distinctions than and different labels than the penn tree bank
mm-hmm
yeah
and the mappings are can be cr pretty difficult for this right
or is is easy to map between finer grained distinctions and coarser ones
it's i'm t it's probably easy to dumb down the h. p. s. g. parse too
think so
'cause the penn tree bank parsers are pretty minimal because they didn't wanna commit to a specific grammatical theory
yeah yeah
yeah
so i mean it probably is worth looking at
okay
'cause they're doing this with dan flickinger right
which is the same um parser as the redwoods tree bank was made with that alex talked about yesterday
mm-hmm
so you can look at redwoods parses
um and see how different they are from tree bank parses
and you might wanna talk to alex to find out if somebody's already done this turn redwoods stuff into tree bank stuff so that they can compare
you know against results that are reported on tree bank
mm-hmm
huh
the names would suggest that this was the idea right
well that was the idea i believe but um
yeah
it was supposed to be another tree bank
right
so y that sort of assumes that we think it's better to do this by deriving chunks from um some parsed format than just hand chunking the stuff
well the good thing about that is that then you know that when you go through and parse you'll be getting the same chunks as when you do this process automatically
'cause the problem w when you go through and hand do it is then suddenly you introduce your automatic method and your accuracy goes can go way down
mm-hmm
i mean sometimes it doesn't if you know sort of for part of speech tagging you know
whether you do it by hand or machine it's pretty much the same accuracy right
yeah
but
so let's try it this way
and then that that puts off the question of um when do we have to do this to when we get h. p. s. g. stuff right
so can you ask um d. f. k. i. whether they can give us a couple ami meetings run through their h. p. s. g. process
mm-hmm
i don't even know what time scale they had in mind
i mean it is this something they w they were doing it at the moment but i don't know whether this was very preliminary or do you remember
they talked about it at the meeting that we went to in
twenty minute yeah
twente
twente yeah
mm-hmm
i was thinking enschede
why can't i remember the n the f the right name of this place
mm-hmm
yes twente
contact
which
you were there jean
yeah
yeah okay
yeah
y you're expecting me to remember stuff aren't you
no no no no no no no
i i i know you missed a meeting and s and so there there may have been you missed the one in t. n. o.
oh yeah
oh i don't even know which one i've missed
brussels amsterdam
t. n. o. okay
t. n. o. yeah
see i wasn't there
so i don't know where it was
okay
yeah 'cause yeah they did some work bio project with the h. p. s. g. parsing
um
yeah
at least bio
on on which project
sorry i didn't get that
verbmobil right
yeah well maybe
yes yes they did
yeah
okay
hmm
yeah
so ask 'em right
it well that's that's what alex talked about yesterday right
okay
mm-hmm
the parse i mean that's wasn't something she did but that's the data she's using right
mm-hmm
so we have all that stuff here you know the parsed verbmobil material
so you can look at that and see what the parse trees look like
you don't need to wait for d. f. k. i.
no
and if it turns out that you think oh there's no way i can map these into penn tree bank style bracketing
mm-hmm
then then we have to think of something else right
okay okay
hmm
mm-hmm
but i think they had that in mind
so it's it's worth also talking to her about that
okay good
so it's talk to alex see if it looks like it maps by looking at the verbmobil
if it does ask d. f. k. i. either for data or a time scale and you're gonna need to know how much data you need in order to do that
so do you have a technique for estimating how much data you'd need
yeah
uh not sure c uh
i don't know how you do that so who knows how you do that
everybody always says there's no data like more data
okay
so just ask d. f. k. i. how much data and when right
okay
if
you know i mean the typical thing is to do leave one out cross validation with you know eighty nine dialogues
yeah
yeah i know
yeah
okay so i trained on eighty eight and then or i train on one thousand nine hundred and ninety nine and okay but we should speak to steve
okay
uh we don't have any particular time in mind when we need a chunker that works on this stuff
we might have some um
so
well the question the question is what what is chunking gonna help
i mean i think chunking could help automatic dialogue act segmentation
yeah
i think chunking could help as you mentioned named entity recognition
yeah
um
well i gue if we did a chunked version of the ami data and stuck it into c. v. s. under the automatic contributions then um people would end up using it
mm-hmm
'cause they do that right
mm-hmm
so the question is at what stage should we put that in
well we'd wanna make sure we're pretty happy that it's reliable because
yeah so post evaluation so we can put in some idea of what the evaluation is like
mm yeah
i mean otherwise
you get these very bizarre results because the data is not really very good
mm-hmm
so um but i and nobody has expressed like massive interest in t in chunking
so i think you know nobody's uh waiting for it
no but he's relying it on it th this summer
but but we could we c i think we should talk to barbara about how to do some joint experiments or or if she's gonna be sending other people
maybe liz or whoever comes over next time
uh and it would actually be great if it was liz because i think she is the one who did the dialogue act segmentation automatic
mm-hmm
so when when do you think that would be
when when is she sending somebody
she just said that hopefully by the next meeting she would be bringing someone else or someone else would be coming instead of her remember
oh for the next one mm-hmm
mm
mm-hmm
but that's a pretty tight time scale then right 'cause it'd be for the fall we'd wanna know the evaluation
is that the time scale you're thinking of or
the th not to have not to have it done but just to talk about how it could interact with automatic dialogue act segmentation
how it could be done
yeah
um and we i guess we should talk to yoshi about about it in relationship to named entities
who's uh who's doing named entities besides yoshi
uh that's all i think
okay
uh
so we could talk to vasilis about that as well
mm-hmm
i think you should still ask barbara again you know c can you have another think about who might have the chunking stuff
'cause she has said several times there must be somebody and she can help with that
and um i think she's just forgotten
so
and then
so and then we can evaluate on the icsi you know pretty easily
so one thing that would be very helpful for me because i haven't read i think we're in a situation where jean you know
has read a lot of literature and i've read a lot of literature and we there is some overlap
but there's also quite a big space where we don't know the literature from the other side
and since you're gonna be reading it i mean it would be probably be useful if you made some kind of
you know report that described you know okay this what these people you know this is
you know a synthesis okay here's the basic idea behind exchange structure and
you know here's a couple of you know here's the two most relevant works that i've read or something like that you know to just
yeah even if it's just a you know on a wiki the um the references and then why they're relevant right
i mean you don't wanna make this really formal or do you
or even just like a paragraph of you know the basic idea
yeah a paragraph each
just because you know obviously i'm not gonna go rea off and read all this kind of stuff because i don't have time
yeah
and you probably don't have time to read all this collaborative prol problem solving
hmm-hmm
yeah
but that wou that would help us be a lot more specific ab than than just um you know
so
listing bullet points on slides cause then we'd know sort of which literature you're thinking of um putting in and we could read the most important argumentative stuff
okay
yeah yeah
yeah
well in any way every time you write a paper you've got to go back and do this related work thing anyway
i can have these things anyway yeah
so it just it just makes it a lot easier um to get that
yeah
mm-hmm
common ground i think you know
'kay
yeah yeah
i think it's a real advantage that we've read different things and come at it from a different side because i think this ha they the the previous approaches haven't really
mm-hmm
you know taken you know the good features from you know both sides and and tried to put them together
they haven't addressed this problem
yeah
yeah
hmm
i'm gonna have to go very soon because i've got this um this hearing to go to
yeah me too
but uh so the practical actions you know what are the things we're gonna go away and do
i can send you a l
yeah
well i think we both wanna send w well i don't know maybe you've already done this but i you know
i will send you or we can you know
chat off line for a minute a about a list of things that i think you really need to take a look at
yeah yeah
and jean probably maybe you should do the same
okay
um
s so then later yeah
okay
and if sabrina has any ideas we'd be happy to hear from sabrina as well
yeah
um
um right now d uh i'm doing i'm trying to do the uh meeting action segmentation
mm-hmm
j because uh after talking to jane um just uh we have different ideas whether uh meeting action will be about the same size as topic segments
okay
so um it would be good to um t right now i'm doing this
yeah
mm-hmm
um looking at the data and trying to see if i can do the meeting action segmentation first and the scheme
mm-hmm
m
and then do topic segmentation again to see if the boundary actually coincide with each other
mm-hmm
hmm
yeah if if that that do then maybe we can talk again whether um i it it make sense
yeah
yeah
so you can do this exercise and then come and talk to me some time next week
mm-hmm
i'm not in monday but the other days i'll be around
alright yeah
mm-hmm
um i have just started
and um so far um i s think uh it's uh it i think it it's a still um about the s about the same level of segmentation we're talking here
yeah
but uh maybe the boundary will not be exactly the same
yeah
s
yeah so this this is interesting but i w i don't think we can afford to l um look at this right now
but uh that that the segment
mm-hmm right sure
so why don't you bring it by um next week
yeah
and i what i really wanna do concentrate just now is is finding out the how we're gonna help um wei xun with with making progress on this
mm-hmm
mm sure
mm-hmm
yes
so we've already got you know he's gonna um construct a list of the references he thinks is important
and johanna and i and and you as well are gonna contribute to that
mm-hmm
and we can put that on a wiki or we can do it some other way
i mean you know i'm wiki mad
mm-hmm
okay
so um if we share it it should go on a wiki 'cause i can't find anything in my email
hmm
but you know you don't have to do that
yeah it's yeah
hmm
um and then uh how do we you're actually so what you're doing is taking all of the the the most important references for um finding argument structure that might i eventually be of some use to a meeting browser and trying to look at actual data and apply and and see like which one helps you figure out what you're actually gonna do with this particular data
right
so it seems to me that we should take like the front runner scheme and the data and you should look at not front runner scheme but front runner theory and i see if you can speak to the data
you know using that kind of theory at some point
and might might be an interesting exercise right
well i think we need to um like you mentioned earlier um factor in what this might be used for in the end
and so even if it we won't it won't be used
maybe if it would need some higher level analysis before it could be directly used for that purpose we should still keep that in mind
the update
and so i think going through the presentations that um were given at the work package six meeting where um and i think it was um it wasn't wha was it anita or was it oh i've forgotten her name
mm-hmm
hmm
the other woman um from twente you know they talked about
they did they had done a lot of questionnaires and they got some user requirements out of that
and then steve presented um the results of following people around and looking at how they used their notes from meetings
mm-hmm
hmm
and and so that would give us some ideas about you know what people want you know out of meeting records
but then we should also add things that we think are interesting
yeah
but that's a good starting point yeah
but just to have to keep some of these goals in mind 'cause they're t o one scheme might let you answer this set of questions but wouldn't help you at all with another set of questions
that'll be the exactly yeah
so you wanna go through basically the user requirements and you know maybe think about some user requirements of your own and make a case for
you know these are the kinds of things that we'd want and look you're gonna need um this kind of dialogue or argument structure for it
so should we expect that all the slides from like the work package six meeting or the joint work package five work pa will be u up on one of the work package web sites
and if not how do we make that happen
um uh uh i'll think about that
hmm okay
some of this was presented in at least the one spider phone or the second spider phone telecon i went to for work package six
so if they're not on the web we can try to look at that
you know at the materials that were presented in that telecon without necessarily listening to the whole telecon
yeah
yeah
so we're just trying to get records
wh
i mean i'm sure they're not on the web yet
and steve m and his i've forgotten the name is it was it simon his yeah
so
yeah
they they've i think they may have written this up um in a report um
mm-hmm yeah
but i wou would hope that's on the work package six web site as well
yeah
okay
so so we're gonna go through the requirements like that and did did you think that's that was reasonable to after that to try and um actually
you know take some theory that seems fairly reasonable and think about the particular data and come and talk
i do as i once he's read a couple more i mean he's just completely missed out the collaborative problem solving world
yeah
i there's a few references missing
yeah
which i d i really think we need to take into account
i mean you may take it into account and say no you're wrong and here's why but i i i'm gonna need some convincing
yep
so then try front runner scheme on well a front runner theory
or t or or two and see this one gives you this and this g and can't you know are they fundamentally incompatible
or can we yeah mm-hmm
yeah
but try it informally
yep mm-hmm
when do we get together again
'cause i really do have to go
okay
i promised these guys i'd be there
i think this is gonna take about three weeks 'cause he's got plenty of reading to do
uh-huh
but w
so maybe we get together again in the yeah i mean i'll send them the references immediately
reading lists before that though so right
so we'll get together in about three weeks
okay
uh
is that enough time for you do you think
sorry
you mean mm
is that enough time for you to to read and think about
i will try my best yeah
if y if if it's too tight you know i think m we can say four
oh yeah
uh i m i might yeah 'cause uh julie and the boy is here
or are you gonna be on holiday
so
it's a little tiring 'cause my parents have left
yeah
uh yeah
uh-huh
so i might take two weeks off two weeks off in uh may yeah sometimes yeah
maybe four weeks
okay
okay
so we should get together probably in about four weeks yes
off yeah
four weeks yeah
okay thanks
so when are you gonna bring this beautiful baby in to see everybody
mm
uh yeah hope i hope so very soon
i want to see
yeah
yeah
good good
something
that's great
sure
right
i'm gonna head off
yep
well good luck solving your problem
okay thanks
mm-hmm
c 'cause floods are more important than dialogue structure i'm afraid
i have to tick and tick
it does something weird when you do that
and something to fidget with
okay
see
right
on your marks get set go
'kay
right
hmm
such a long time since i've done these
did did you guys actually had sort of um the interaction or discussions while you we doing the annotation
did you have had stages of clarification or i suppose you did right
we did yeah
at the beginning we did
mm-hmm
um
we did a training set didn't we and then compared to see
yeah
yeah we did two of those didn't we
we probably did
i think we did two training sets and then we had at least one meeting with you where we talked it all through
yeah
mm
mm-hmm
and supposedly decided on things
and then we did th all the rest of them separately
yes
yeah
so did you feel that it was some some kind of some process of convergence
like that initially had quite different ideas about the phrase types and and markations and then eventually you came up uh with some kind of rules that you set up between uh the two of you
yes i think
or
i'd say no
but i d i mean i thought we had basically the same ideas to b i don't remember ever having strong arguments about what should be in what group or it was just the rules about things that s yeah
okay
yeah but you convinced me
no that's true
mm-hmm
it's the length of it really
mm-hmm
but we had
and what counted as wha as for the spectral features it was more confusing what counted as a spectral feature and we had a long discussion about that
that's really hard yeah
mm-hmm
yeah
but i don't remember sort of arguing from different sides and converging just sort of piecing out what would come up and agreeing what we'd do
mm-hmm
no
yeah
yeah
mm-hmm
and we we had a manual which we haven't got here
do you reckon if we get a copy would that be useful
it probably would be but i don't i it's been a long time yeah since we've done this
mm
mm-hmm
are we allowed to leave the meeting now it's started
can we get ben to print us out one
yeah i think so
yeah that would be handy
okay
mm
yeah
i dropped a
okay
yes now we're moving with the headphones
sign off
so did dere derek and ben has the um the file that they this manual
or
we did send it to him yeah
he has had it certainly
yes he's he's been e emailed it yeah
yeah
yeah
yeah
yeah he's been emailed it while ago
otherwise we can go onto our system and get it
o okay
now he's gone
there's a cool little count down clock that lets you know exactly how long you've been meeting as well
yes
let's say something rude
oh really
excellent
i oh
top
we should have these things in our area
you know we don't have high tech things
but no how little work we did
no we don't at all
i'm doing that at yes
well i guess there's telescopes but that that's that's different though isn't it
yeah
but they're hardly in our areas
that's not no
yeah
uh
they have got a
conference thing haven't they
in the a. t. c.
yeah that's right although you oh it isn't actually used all that often these days i think
i had to fly to germany to do a teleconference the same as you did for the interview
yeah i did as well
gosh
and they fly you to germany and put you on a four way teleconference with three people in chile
and had they asked we could have done it fine at a. t. c. and saved me having to to go to germany for a day
right aye
no
right
but
gosh
they haven't got that far
it's a very strange interview feeling as well because you can't see them while you're giving your talk
mm
and you miss all the the body language and things
yeah yeah
because they just show usually they have a camera on you and a camera on them
right
but during the talk part they have a camera on i believe them 'cause i could see that guy reading a newspaper halfway through my talk
and then they had a camera on showing what my slides were and so you forget that they can see you at all
right
right
and so when all that was over they were answering me questions and the view switched again i realised they were sitting there in the interview going
and mine was even it was different again
so
w we had it was a four way split screen with me and three other people and it just stayed like that
right
and i had the talk on a laptop in front of me and they had the talk on their laptops
right
and i had to tell tell them when to press the button to turn the page
oh
right
yeah
gosh
it just
and you can't say looking over here
yes if you see towards the top left of the image you'll notice and luckily olivia had warned me it might be complicated
yeah
like o
yeah
and so i had something with without very many um n not little flying in and things because that would just make it really difficult
that's very artificial though isn't it
yeah
not very sensible
yeah right
but i practised the talk yeah standing up in front of it and pointing to things
yeah
yeah
and you're sitting down in front of and you could see yourself but not only could s you see yourself you see yourself bounce back two seconds later
by the time the signal had gone to chile and back
that must be really weird
yeah
is there
it is really strange
gosh
so you're like oh did i just do that
and then you reacting to what you did a while ago
yeah
gosh
it was a really daft situation
well mm-hmm
mm
okay right it's printing it out as well
great
lovely
excellent
and then we can start fighting about
right
shall w shall we dive in in the interim
or
yes let's
continuum flux or continuum
mm
yes
mm
flux on its own wouldn't be a spectral feature
i think it should probably just be continuum
if it was continuum luminosity you probably wouldn't it
ooh
no you wouldn't do
i think i'm do i think i'm working out who's top and bottom
um
yeah i'm happy enough with that
i don't feel strongly about it
okay it's my part
i actually haven't really thought about like uh marking or not marking who's top and who's bottom
oh
i think maybe that would make sense for you guys to know
i don't know
ah
i think i think we've worked
ben said he he left it out on purpose which is reason
yeah
yes and i'm pretty sure i'm bottom anyway
yeah
i'm pretty sure i'm top
so even on one we can tell
uh
okay fair enough
'cause i would fight for line being a spectral feature as well
right
right
yeah i think that's probably right as well
it's a bit hard to mark on this
let's do that
okay next
so so you sorry um just for the convention you you you marking which uh which the annotation you think is is the right one
the ones we want
okay fair enough
yes
and if neither then we'll have to put something else
mm-hmm okay
okay
so here we're missing soft component on the bottom
and i think you're probably right soft component is a spectral feature
there
if you get line i get soft component
ooh
do you think
sorry i i shouldn't intervene probably
well if you don't no
but well the um isn't it that if um it's a region of the spectrum that's u
yeah go ahead
and we can point at it
and then it is a sp a sp spectral f f
mm-hmm
yeah
feature and that isn't
pi
you can point to a soft component
you can point to a soft component
you think
yeah
yeah
okay alright
it's a big bump in the soft bit
okay
is it
okay okay
uh now is a feature part of spectral feature
i think you're right there as well
it c uh yeah i'm not fussed about that
'cause it it's not just absorption
they both mean the same thing
but it's not just absorption point five k. v.
it is actually something in the absorption that you're seeing
if it was a
a dip in absorption or a
yeah
a lack of absorption you would put it in because we said we would put describing words
this is the this is the thing you point to yep
yeah that's the thing you point to and this is a ph a physical mechanism
mm-hmm
so yeah i'd say
two down
you would get a pencil
two hundred and fifteen to go
excellent
that's two
mm that's definitely two
you're right
ah there's one with the equivalent width
i think you're right that we we weren't gonna mark the equivalent width but we were gonna mark the lines
i think that's true
yeah
alrighty
what are we missing
broad line
broad line
and that should be a and nebulae
yeah that's true
you get that
uh
as a source type
i don't remember what we were doing with nebulae
we weren't doing like h. two regions and stuff were we
i can't remember
i can't remember actually
should we see when the manual comes
yeah
so let's come back to that one
yeah
um
yep
yes
i what we're doing about that either
mm we were doing descriptions that made things separate classes in which case i'd argue for elliptical i think
select a
yeah that seems reasonable
my god i've just gone mad with the underlining here
yes
um
yeah i
breaking the power law index i think that's probably a you can point to it but equally it's not a it's something you've derived
yeah that's the thing but you wouldn't know it was a p yeah
the parallel index is something you desi derive
a break in a spectrum is something you can point at
yeah
so
so what's a breaking a power law index
i think it's a feature
um because in the s sp spectrum it does that and it does that
mm-hmm
so it yeah
yeah b that thing there
yep
that's that is where it breaks
okay
so yeah
slight depression of the continuum near the lyman limit
i think you're right there as well
and if i did it again i'd say a slight depression of the continuum and possibly well
but we're supposed to say w
'cause you can see both the slight depression and the lyman limit
but we're supposed to say the descriptive words of the features
so
yeah i if it was absorption at h. alpha that would all be one
mm-hmm
or absorption at five thousand nanometres would all be one anyway
yeah but they would be the same they'd both be the same spectral feature whereas here they're two spectral features
because it was at a certain point
but this is near
there's a lyman limit which you could see and then there's a slight depression near it
but
yeah i think you're right
it's it's near rather than at
it's not
yeah
let's mark that then
do you have a sense about that
oh you want to s split that one and do you into two
yeah
yes
yeah
yeah
uh i'd agree with that i think
yeah
is that k. clear
excellent
oh
yeah okay
mm absorption
uh-huh
that i didn't mark because it's the physical process of absorption
yes and you're right there as well
not the the thing
tell you who's more awake at this
would there be other cases where you would actually mark an ab absorption
or
mm-hmm
yeah if it was there's an absorption feature or absorption to see it the spectrum at this wave length
an absorption feature
mm-hmm
mm-hmm
but when you say for example the the quasar is absorbed that just means the quasar is behind a a bunch of stuff
cheers
thanks
yeah
so that's describing something physically rather than describing the spectrum itself
mm-hmm
thank you
mm-hmm
okay
so
thank you
there is no steep soft component but our two k. v.
i don't remember what we were gonna do about things that weren't there
mm
it's not something you can point to
you could point to it if it were there
yes you could
i tend to miss out things if they're too long
um
but if it had been there um you would've
you would point to it
marked it yeah
had it as a feature
yeah
yes i think you're right
yeah
should we go back to number five
is that the nebula
huh
but yes nebula
oh yeah
was it the nebula thin yeah
yeah
mm-hmm
what were we saying about nebula
source types
no nebula counts doesn't it
i think it does
right
we weren't matching a h. two regions because it was a region i think was the argument for that
yeah
line again
line in ratios
yeah but that's line ratios
but i remember we weren't gonna mark line ratios but we were going to mark 'cau we're here where you've got equivalent width of h. beta orbited
but
ratio is different i guess
uh line in in line in line ratios is modifying ratios
mm
it isn't it
it's it's not talking about specific lines
i guess it's similar
a line ratio is a thing
yeah because you haven't actually listed explicitly um that you're not going to include it
right
don't include
l line ratio is after abundances
so
is that the value or is that the word
yeah
oh i see what you mean
yeah
um
don't it in include the derived property
yeah
yeah i mean you wouldn't you wouldn't include abundances or line strengths
well
no
yeah it shouldn't be in
you wouldn't include line in that
okay
i don't think
whoop no
oh i see what you're doing you're circling the one we like right
the one to keep yeah
damped lyman alpha absorbers i think that's a spectral feature even though it's
you wouldn't mark the source type
oh sorry um yep
um so so can i just ask w w now you just uh aligned d uh sorry you circle the word in the in the outline which didn't
here
yes because we don't want it underlined
right sorry
it shouldn't be highlighted
ok oh i see okay
mm-hmm
so
uh right damped lyman see again that's uh these are source types the um i mean it's not a source type
yeah
cheers
m
i see
b
mm-hmm
but it's also a i i if we have
but damped lyman alpha absorbers are th are physical things not spectral features
but th but you also absorb them by y you observe them by their spectral feature
what were we doing for things broad absorption line quasar for example
we were marking the broad absorption line as well as broad absorption line quasar
ye
so i think it should be the same as that
if it's defined by a spectral feature we should mark it
but uh you wouldn't be able to point something in a spectrum and say that's a damped lyman alpha absorber unless you'd
here
you could point to damped lyman alpha though
yeah
because it says here spectral features we're now referring to a type of source e. g. quasar
yeah you could do
but we wouldn't say absorbers were a type of source
um not a bis specific type of source but i think still the the spectral feature ge counts even though it's m a modifier of something
okay
i'm not certain about that but i
what do you reckon bob
hmm
um
well i mean you could look at this this spectrum and spot that um th l lyman alpha has been damped
but
that is a n spectral feature
d don't with damped lyman alpha observers you them a variety of places along the line of sight
so you have to know
oh yeah
no that's true
how does it work
i don't know what which doesn't help
if you look at a quasar and you see a bunch uh if you got a bunch of clouds of gas in the way
you can see these things and but you wouldn't be able to point at one of them and say ah that's a damp yeah
mm-hmm
different redshifts
yeah yeah yeah that's true
they're gonna be at different red shifts
y ye
but that doesn't mean that it's you could still say that's damped lyman alpha and that's damped lyman alpha
i don't know how they do th that
yeah but
you could say all of that is damped lyman alpha
but
but you're guessing in a way though aren't you
yeah
so
but isn't that j always the case with something that's not particularly
ye
well no but you see them in all sorts of different red red shifts
it's like the the lyman alpha forest sort of
mm-hmm
and i'm not certain i would
i would mark that
mm that's a that's a tricky one certain certainly
it's a tricky one
it it if it was if it was some other spectral feature and then absorbers
would we mark it
um no i wouldn't because it's they're physical things not spectral features
you can't point at something on a spectrum and say that's definitely a d damped lyman alpha some i g and i guess it's because they're modifiers of this source type
and we wouldn't mark that source type
but
but we include modifiers of source types we would mark
wouldn't you
we wouldn't mark absorbers no
we're not marking absorbers
but if it was a damped lyman alpha quasar
wouldn't you have all of it
then we would mark quasar and we would mark damped lyman alpha
right well th yeah th that's in the the manual
yeah
if it was broad absorption line quasar we'd mark it
yeah
yeah
so
so it's just i guess whether damped lyman alpha is a spectral feature
in itself
hmm it's tricky one
which i would probably say it was but then i've never looked at i one
i g i guess it is
i
okay
and that it is altering the spectrum isn't it
i mean is a ch
mm-hmm
change in the s spectrum of
okay
it doesn't have to be something that's specific
background objects
i guess y you know we we say a uh big blue bump or a soft or a continuum
and we include those
but we weren't going to include s descriptions of spectral features that were based on fitting were we
that true but w we have included c power law though
uh is that right
have we
well no we included p steep soft component sorry
and here we included breaking the power law because of the break
steep soft component
yeah breaking the power law is something i'm not certain of
steep soft component is something you can point at in a spectrum and say there it is
mm-hmm
but there's still some degree of fitting and it's steep you're saying
yeah
yeah
you know what's steep and what's shallow
it's tricky
let's have that for now then
you if if we change our mind later when we go through we can always come back to it and say
yeah
that's grand
yeah
yeah
yes
no
um again i'd say this this is a physical process not a spectral feature
yeah you're right
uh
and absorption again
yeah
right what have we got different here
uh i don't have k. star but i should do
hmm
it's
yeah it's that one and this one here
oh we were including feature within spectral feature
wait where
okay
okay
what's wrong with broad h. alpha
i think i just missed it
right
i think it's not as if it's a although it's four widths half maximum it's still the s the line within it
yeah
okay
that was easy
silicone two is an element rather than a
in this context
rather than a line
these are the lines
i guess what you w
if wasn't in there then you'd have it silicone two lines at but without with the i think that means silicone two derived from these two features
yeah
yeah i think so too in that
okay
m
that's actually an ionic species isn't it actually
yeah that's true yeah
not a a spectral feature as such o on its own
mm
yeah that's true
lyman alpha forest clouds
oh no we're back to it again
lyman alpha forest you can point to on the spectrum
that's true but lyman alpha forest clouds are source types we aren't marching marking
so we haven't basically we just haven't got a a rule for
spectral features within or referring to s types of source when we're not bother marking the source
which we don't mark yeah
but we can just be consistent
so are we marking h. two and h. two regions for example
and i don't think we are 'cause that's not a spectral feature in the spectrum we're looking at
oh that's true
but b yeah but i guess it's not it's not defined by a spectral feature though h. two region whereas
no
yeah
lyman alpha forest is defined by the definition of lyman alpha forest clouds is that they have lyman alpha forests
but saying that isn't the same as saying we've seen that in a spectrum
whereas a broad line quasar someone has looked at it and they've seen a broad line
but someone's l someone's looked at that spectrum
but if you're discussing lyman alpha forest clouds they could just be discussing the physical object which we aren't marking
b b why aren't you marking it then
because they weren't i don't know
i don't think we were making diffuse diffuse emission or
the the
anything blobby i di i didn't mark
yeah
uh-huh
um
i it it wouldn't count as a source type
or
well that's p what i'm p pondering really
yeah
yeah
yeah
um
i w i remembered not marking nebula or clouds or
hmm
yeah but this is um species of cloud it's a p
yeah
a particular species of cloud not just a general cloud isn't it
so isn't that different
mm
mm
it's a modifier of of clouds but i don't th don't think if we're including the
yeah
i think if we're not including nebula and clouds we can't include
i think we just have to decide whether we're doing it
yeah but bob's saying maybe we should be uh including nebula and clouds
perhaps we should've done
but we haven't for the whole thing
but we haven't done for the whole thing
so i think maybe we just need to put under don't include diffuse emission
okay th
yeah
mm-hmm
then i guess not then
yeah
hmm
but then we still have to decide if we don't label the source what do we do about the spectral features that define that source
i if we have for example broad absorption line object we mark that
we mark broad absorption line in that
but that's 'cause we've to know it's a rather broad absorp absorption line object we have seen it
it's an but just to know this is a lyman alpha forest cloud we're seen lyman alpha forest
uh
and
but it's in this s sp sp sp sp spectrum of another object though
it it isn't the spectrum of the clouds
but it's still a spectral feature even if it's not it might be a spectral feature i not in the cloud
yeah
but it a spectral feature in the quasar the lyman alpha forest
that is true
yeah
uh and he could point at it that's true and say that is
yeah
okay
let's keep them
yeah
yeah
even if not marked
no one else can read that sorry
yeah
nope
okay so th lyman alpha forest again
and here
yep
and that definitely is a spectral feature on its own then 'cause it doesn't even say lyman alpha forest clouds
yeah
yeah
mm-hmm
each helium two optical depth i think that's elemental species
there that's derived you're right
yeah
oh
oh we marked the same lines
oh rubbish
excellent
what have we done differently
uh you've got line brightness temperatures
'cause the property of the line
they're gonna we're gonna have a lot of these
yeah
yeah we are
and we weren't using line
what was the one we didn't do before
line ratio we weren't doing
yeah i don't think line brightness temperatures counts
'cause it's not talking about a specific line
yeah
so yeah
was talking about l lines okay
i don't think that counts
feature
line feature need that
right
um sorry can we just go back th uh one page
did did you resolve the the li the different um segmentations like uh the main problem was
mm-hmm
there's only one difference here
oh sorry i i thought it was a problem of like uh one having underlined the entire oh sorry
oh no
no no i i se okay sorry
no no they are the same otherwise
yeah they're all the same
yeah i see
quite impressively
yes excellent
that one's the same
um damped lyman alpha again
systems
uh yeah
and damped lyman alpha data
that's a modifier of data
i can't even but if you said
i mean that's that's a description of the type of data
if you said the spectral dat
a d
the continuum's spet mm
i really don't think that counts
but if it's a damped lyman alpha spectrum you'd mark damped lyman alpha because in the spectrum
and and a da is equivalent of spectrum
i wouldn't but you would
i think just because it's got a spectral feature in the phrase
you wouldn't for example when we were saying silicone two levels we didn't mark silicone two
that's that's got nothing to do with the spectrum
that's because it was talking about s but if it's saying silicone two line
levels the new word
but what this actually means is we've made some measurements based on damped lyman alpha measurements and they tell us this answer
and this answer is inconsistent with that answer
i think you're probably right in the case of it being data
yeah i don't think that's right
hmm
i'm not sure actually
i th i think i would mark it
and
mm
and that it
it is a region of the spectrum and they're actually using a region of the spectrum
as the data
well
um
if it's an emission line data
but if you both want not to mark it then fine don't mark it
m
mm
if it's an emission line data would we put it in
i wouldn't but because it's a modifier of data
but if it just said em but if it just said emission line we would
it the emission line is strong
the emission line data shows strong
then uh i think it's the same actually i th i think it's data isn't even needed
it's inconsistent with the damped lyman alpha at more than the ninety nine percent
or the damped lyman alpha feature if you put feature there rather than data then you'd mark it
oh feature absolutely
b but
but i think data is equivalent if
so from the perspective the named entity recognition task
mm
so i th i think th there there was also this one guideline of saying for example if something uh is sitting under a negation
right the there was no um damped l. y. alpha something
mm-hmm
mm-hmm
then um we then i think the convention was that we still that you still would mark that
right
so it's more like uh a s it's uh uh it's uh sort of like a quite literal task that's really like finding these kind of uh these types of strings uh rather than really referring to the underlying physical reality
yeah
mm
mm-hmm
which i mean sort of like if if you if you were to resolve these kind of uh cases in order to put them say in a database or so
mm-hmm
then you'd probably be right in this case right
but uh th given that the kind of thing is that that this named entity recogn task is is a much is a much more uh literal thing
like really just fin finding these kind of strings
right
i think in this case um i w i would say this is probably an entity
yeah
okay
okay
yeah
that's think enough
given that we can argue about it for ten minutes it's probably not that clear cut
yeah
alright
damped lyman alpha systems and uh it shouldn't be either of them
take it again but systems should be out
it should be damped lyman alpha
yeah
in red whatever that is
spectral feature
and that shouldn't be there at all
mm 'kay
you've done it again
and i've done it twice
is that clear enough
yes
right
source type
flat spectrum
did we have a rule about this
we were including modifiers including broad line quasars non broad line quasars as well
mm-hmm
so i think we should probably include the flat spectrum with your q with your quasar is a very different from steep spectrum
yep that's true
that is true
we're ten percent of the way there
are we
excellent
just hitting the half an hour mark
you have to s speed up
continua
we'll go p could be here all day
oh gosh it will be here forever
remarkably soft ionising continua
you're right though i think
or or continuum
see that i that's talking about the the flux of kin of ionising photons rather then the continuum of that spectrum
the absorbed continuum
so i don't like that one
mm-hmm yes
oxygen abundance
oxygen shouldn't be there
that's not observed
yeah
heavy element absorption lines i think should be there
mm
i'm happy enough with that
now what else is different
blue shifted
that's okay with me i don't care
yeah you can have that as well
mm
oh thank you
there you go
and that one
next
uh
you're right star forming galaxies are distinct
i think they are
i don't know why i did that
that's yeah derived
i don't like that at all
probably because you were doing seven thousand of these an hour
yeah could be that i was a bit sleepy
lines from ions
you can't tell the difference between a line from an ion and a line line from something else
you mean that
well you'd know where they are in the
well i guess yeah i dunno
if it was lines from h. two you'd mark it
yeah
yeah yeah
that's true
that's true
alright
blue wing flux
what were we gonna do about flux
doesn't say
yeah but the feature itself is blue wing flux or if it was said blue wing feature we'd mark feature
hmm
yes it's the amount of stuff in the blue wing
yeah
so i'm happy with that
line peak
i think that should be marked
even though it's talking about increasing line peak it's also talking about increasing excess blue wing
should actually be excess blue wing flux
possibly
don't know
anyway
ah uh
i think line peak is something you can point to
you can point to it but can you point to a line peak velocity shift
well i y
no but you can't you can't s also point to increa increasing blue wing
yeah i don't think you can
well you can point to blue wing flux 'cause you have your line and there's the blue wing flux
what
mm
but if the line peak is increasingly shifted you'd
yeah uh i don't think that's a feature
okay
mm there's a system issue again so we should be consistent and keep it
light
right
ye yes
right
neutral hydrogen gunn petersen absorption
i think all of that's a spectral
feature
it's basically a way of saying the gunn petersen t it's a way of saying the gunn petersen trough though
really
it's a process isn't it
yeah
which if you just said that it's gunn petersen absorption from neutral hydrogen rather than i if it was a t if it was hydrogen absorption
well
isn't that a process
you'd mark the whole thing
if it was hydrogen align you would so you should mark if it was or h. beta absorption
it's a marks the kind of spectral feature doesn't it
it's a process isn't it
mm
but so is h. beta absorp uh emission as a process from h. beta
but it's still this is a process from neutral hydrogen
i guess what i'm meaning is neutral hydrogen should be in there
and the fact that gunn peterson comes between it
is just a pain
well it i wouldn't
mm
have any of it i think
i think all of that is um just that is process
isn't it
i think i might agree with you
mm
'cause this definitely shouldn't be marked
because that is a process not a
mm-hmm
yeah
a
and if that shouldn't be marked then that shouldn't be marked
okay
let's just cross everything out
right
blue shifted absorption
i think it's a modifier of the thing and so it probably should be there
oh okay
mm
as in we're putting weak and strong absorption would count so i think blue shifted should
yeah
um
that's talking about the line isn't it
so that should be in
hmm yes
okay
you think
yeah
that's talking about uh
strength rather than
um
it's not the uh abundance of it or any derived property it's just the strength of the lines
you don't think that it
actually is abundance really in a way
i'm not sure
but
i guess perhaps it is
i'm not sure
yeah i'm not sure either
yeah
um let's make a decision
but um
i guess it could be abundance
b oh yeah either that if that shouldn't be in neither should either of those
yes that's true
i think you probably should then 'cause we will put in our align strength
mm yeah
uh if it's a f. i of a two line strength we would definitely put it in
yeah that's right
and i think that's what it's referring to even though it's not
uh i
it's not saying
well but it
two
isn't this an elemental um abundance
that you estimate actually using a number of lines
is it it isn't just one discrete
line in the spectrum is it
b
a feature
i'm not sure
its lines
what do you mean
well if you t
it's an abundance i it's an element i guess but it's
is it
two is an ionic species and it'll have a number of
lines in the spectrum and you'll uh estimate
on the abundance all of the s species actually use the old lines
uh
but it's a strength rather than abundance
i think that's still looking at the amount of flux coming out of the out of all the f. e. two lines rather than
we've marked thing have we marked things like
yeah i don't know if we've marked things like silicone one
throughout
in general we haven't if unless it's specifically saying it's a line but i guess the question is just as specifically referred to a line
they haven't been if it's yeah
yeah
yeah
and i maybe it's not clear enough to mark
yeah
let's not mark it then
yeah
if we don't mark it though we definitely shouldn't mark these two should we
well line narrow line
if it says it f. e. two line strength then we would mark it 'cause you're talking about the line of it rather than the ev element
do you agree with that
i think so yeah
if that's true then their leaving out the word line i don't should mean that it shouldn't be marked
the word line should be in there
but
or
oh well what's new
but i mean we know what they mean
like
yeah i think they mean l
i think they mean the line strength rather than the f. e. two abundance
okay
yeah let's leave it in
well then have it in
i think that's what they probably mean
but it's just not very clear
yeah yeah okay
next
b. s. bloated star
uh
that's a
oh is that what that means
yeah
oh yeah
okay
um take out line
mm-hmm
and that's just the wrong
seyfert two
that's just the wrong colour as is that
oh yep
you're right
i think you were right there
radio loud counts yeah
yep you're right
yeah
and you're right there as well
that's a physical process
yeah
okay
that counts
yes that was one i wasn't sure about 'cause infrared
yeah
and if it was mid infrar uh if it was you'd put it in
yeah
that's just the wrong na that's just this should be a source name
yeah the and this shouldn't be should it
i don't know w
m m does those count as modifiers active we definitely include active
yes
i guess the problem is due to what does that m mean
so
i presumed it
what does that mean
it's a k kind of elliptical is it
a e. two is a kind of elliptical
oh yeah yeah
yeah yeah
what i don't know what the j. means
is it
yeah
okay right
'cause that's one i just didn't know what it
uh i thought it was a catalogue
mm
h. alpha i think should be marked yeah
those can does that not mean a a broad band detection
and does that count
sorry what's the i can't see
uh h. alpha detection
yeah you're still detecting a line even if you're detecting it from broad band filters
but don't we say we don't do that
um
ah
i'm right look
broad band
don't include modifiers of regions or systems e. g.
broad line region you are right
region systems
that's why i wasn't doing it
and now align nebulae
right
okay we'll just go back and change those
g ah look at that
you're right
okay where was it
started here
um
why did it so we mark
um we have got nebulae marked here
yeah but b uh modifiers of regions or systems is the
oh
yeah okay modifiers with them which is give a yell if you see one
yeah we could always change this if we think we're right rather than going back through and
so damped lyman alpha absorbers shouldn't be in there
based on this but we could change this rule rather than changing all those things
but then i'm i i p i probably use that rule so half the time and just forgotten to use at other times
what's the what was the appropriate thing to do at this point
um so uh just about changing rules
i mean in a sense you also want to make sure that the annotation that that they the agreements that you arrive on today
that they're consistent with what you did before
mm
right so uh i mean this really only displays uh th those cases where you disagreed
right
right
but if you sorta like change a rule now on the fly then that might be then that might b uh create inconsistencies with the
right
yeah
yep
yeah
'cause you might have followed that rule
yeah
yes i i'm sure i've followed that rule sometimes and just forgotten
right
yeah
so let's take that out
alright
um
um
lyman alpha forest here
yeah
but lyman alpha forest should be in here because it's not talking about uh m it's not modified
yeah that's fine
damped lyman alpha systems
damped lyman alpha data
ah we're back to damped lyman alpha data
data i think we should keep in
okay
because it's would be the same as feature
i
or spec spectrum
i do i still don't think that goes in
i think data's the same as spectrum 'cause the data is a spec m
but
yeah
i still don't like it
but
final view bob
i don't have passionate feelings
i wouldn't i think now probably
okay
mm let's take that out
and this one comes out as well
yep
okay so we want nothing
yeah just cross those out
there
didn't it
yeah
right
oops
we're there
right
excellent
so what were we looking at this page for anyway
it was for something else h. alpha detection
h. alpha detection
uh
broad band detections is in don't include
but i wouldn't is h. alpha broad brand
well h. l. was a line there really isn't it
it's a line
so
whether you detect it
oh so it would be a narrow band detection a narrow band imaging detection
yeah
alright good
yeah
i think so
h. alpha emitters are not
a distinct class of source i don't think
no they aren't
line
just out of curiosity this narrow and broad band that that refers to the type of spectrogram that you have
like t on the type of filter or is it oh okay
yeah exactly that
yeah
mm-hmm
yeah okay
yeah exactly that
but i guess if you're picking out a spectral feature even with a broad band or narrow band then it's still a spectral feat feature
if you're picking out a line
yeah okay
what however you pick it out
yep
line on its own
i think there's gonna be a lot of those which makes life simpler
okay yeah
right
uh this is another systems thing
yep
absorption profiles
i think that i think the whole thing should actually be marked
even this complex
okay
how far should we go
yeah
no
comple just absorption per
um
yeah absorption profiles i'll go for
why not
um
lyman alpha forest line blanketing or lyman alpha forest line
yeah take out the blanketing
has this
ah right
is it a system
yep
v. l. b. a. is an instrument
oh is it
yeah v. l. b. i. is uh a net uh it's it's a v. l. b. i. is it's a technique
is a network
but is it
technique
yeah
it's not a yeah
yes
the network is an instrument though isn't it
v.
what's it's called something else isn't it
it
the v. o.
v. l. b very long baseline array
it's e. v. n. isn't it
yeah it's called a v. l. b. a.
v. l. b. a.
if it had an a. on the end it would be the ne instrument
this is
well it
v. l. b. i. network image
so do they mean the v. l. b. a.
isn't all of
this is an instrument if you have it all isn't it
european v. l. b. i. net
is it in it it's an intstru group instrument not a research group
yes 'cause it ta it takes an image
i think so
yeah
so oh but then a m research group could take an image
yeah
yeah
okay let's oh how much of modifiers are we putting in
but um
it's only supposed to be proper names
but i don't
which it is uh i think
yeah is that so this whole thing is an instrument you say
from one point six or from european
that's what i think
oh
oh i think it's uh um s s s starting with um eu european i think
or just um v. l. b. a.
he's using capitals
oh i see i see
but s
yeah
okay
so is this like it's a subset of the v. l. b. a.
uh yes
uh-huh
just in europe
right
but it's actually merlin and all the i um international logs in europe all
hooked up into one instrument basically
cool
yeah
okay
right
oh
that is a source name you're right
that's just broad band isn't it
broad line emission
yeah that's just
so that shouldn't be marked
radio loud objects
it's not ve it's not a m mod it's not an original system
mm-hmm
m
we say something about objects and i think it's that we don't use it
anything ending in object we don't include yep
yeah
ye
so none of those
yep
now we've both marked line ratios here
yeah but we shouldn't have done
and that's the same
so that's it yeah
continuum
yeah that's fair enough
it's certainly not a source name
and there it's different because you're talking about the ionizing continuum which is a pre
yeah that means that's a proc it's a process or it's a it's a type of photons that's not the continuum you're looking at
yeah
i think you can point to line pairs
sure you can yep
and that shouldn't be in there
mm nope
neither should that
yep
scribble away
excellent
you're right there
that's all one big spectral feature
and nebula shouldn't be marked
have we agreed on that
what do we do back here
we only agreed that so far we've only agreed that we can't include spectral features modifying nebula
but i don't see yet where it's written down that you can't mark nebula
what did we do back here
we did mark nebula yes
yeah
it was things that weren't distinct like yeah
yeah but the see there's so many different kinds of nebula
yeah
i think is why i wasn't doing it
mm-hmm yeah it's a difficult one
but if we're gonna stick to it let's stick to it
yeah
if we're going to have them let's have them
the
what's different
the
oh yeah
um don't mind
and i think we need the
i think we would put stop putting the in we could get confused
hmm
mm-hmm
and you're right there
you're right
there
source type
oh yeah
line blanketing
line blanketing you think y
sh i no i don't think i did i
we had line blanketing just now and we included it
so that yeah
i think we sh um
did we
did you
i thought it was a process and that it it wasn't included
ah
um
where was it
we did just have it don't know
yeah
it wasn't that far back was it
don't think n lyman f forest line blanket we took blanketing out
no it wasn't that far back
line yeah we took blanketing out so i don't think that should be in
yeah
and that's all the same
is that it
yeah
uh that's a source nine
yes
isn't it
yes it is
yeah
red and blue components
i think you're right there as well
mm
yeah
yeah
i think i'm right
really
yeah i think i in the same way that you can point to
the soft x. rays or or the hard x. rays you can point to the red and the
oh yeah
well i would argue about see because i think that i mean th that you only extract that after you actually model a sp spectrum don't you
yeah
hmm
mm the soft excess you can definitely point to on an x. ray thing
you kn you know if there's one there or not you could say that's that
so
yeah
you're saying you wouldn't know it was soft unless you'd
but have a component though as such
w oh yeah
i see what
but we're talking about the c the continuum though
if you have a galaxy spectrum though you can say there's the blue component there's the red component to the spectrum
yeah g um c
oh i see what you mean i like it comes from adding two different things together
yeah that's that's what i'm thinking that
mm
i can see that yeah
it's actually really um after you actually model the s a spectrum not just actually looking at the spectrum
but results from spectral
yes
yeah you think
give that for red and blue components but i wouldn't probably give that for soft component
because a soft excess is a uh i mean that's an x. ray thing
y
like a break you say oh look there's
but if it said red or blue excess rather than red or blue component i guess the problem with
yeah
yeah but um component it is m means it's an element actually in the model though
mm
yeah
yeah i'd take out red and blue
mm-hmm okay
let's
which means maybe we should take out soft
but it's such a basic sort of you look at a spectrum and you say that's a a soft excess it's a soft
well uh
the excesses yeah
yeah
but um the component isn't
it's just a t
if you modelled it with two parts one that had a a ha a harder and softer spectrum hubble in hubble deep field south
yeah
yeah
yeah
that's probably true yeah
um hubble and hubble deep sent to us
i didn't include it
although it does apply to the telescope
i think i would
yeah
but mm
yeah
yeah
let's keep it in
so should w did we have a soft component earlier
yes
so we sh should kill it
yeah
yeah
anyone remember when
no
i
i think actually pretty early on i'd have thought
let's start at the beginning
yeah
there it is
oh
excellent
um
right
hubble
alright
no wait the top one i think you should include
possibly with flux as well though
mm d yeah okay
yeah that's fine i'm happy with all that
and then yes the whole thing
yeah
well i said radio galaxies
now what did we p we say about acronyms where part of it was useful
yeah that counts
um
do we ha did we s make a decision about radio galaxies
'cause i think
they are discussed as a separate source type aren't they
where are they
um
radio galaxies
uh only just
i
interesting because on the hour it yeah
it hides that yeah
yeah you're right
but i don't think we should mark high red shift in that
yeah
yeah
no
they are just red shi but yes
no it is yeah
wh what did we say about acronyms where
where part of it's useful
i think you're supposed to mark the whole thing aren't you
yes i think you are
mm-hmm
yeah so you're right
um
seyfert one point eight and one point nine galaxies
it's a sub classification of seyfert's
would make a s study seyfert one point eights
you wouldn't say we're talking about yes
well people do though don't they
oh do they
i mean it's pretty s stupid but they do
i think they probably are
you're right yeah
yeah i think so
inseparate
yeah that's fine
and it's just the and that annoys
mission line feature we're gonna include
uh yep
yeah galaxy and galaxy formation doesn't count
galaxy when it's a process
yes
and yes that counts
ah now this is one
where it should be this one but what if you'd un if these are doubly underlined
but in
has it just plotted the top colour
oh was it actually possible to doubly underline things
yes
yeah
um
i don't know wh which one it would display then
okay because what we want here let's just mark what we want and mark that but with also broad line
right but i'm on the
yeah
i can't write
i i actually didn't know that it was possible to have these so you you you allowed these kind of embedded uh annotations
we changed it so that you could
yeah
mm
yeah because quite often uh an object class is defined by a spectral feature
right okay
mm-hmm
okay
like broad line radio galaxies
mm-hmm
yeah
mm-hmm
broader lines i think
yeah i don't think that should go in
don't mind
list the wrong wrong colour for a few things
oh up here
oh it's all here
hyper luminous galaxy
if you're having ultra loom this early on then i think you have to have here
yeah
mm-hmm
this is just a colour issue
mm
is it
or is it oh right
and q. s. o. is not yeah you're right
ye
yeah they should all be and that one
yep
i. s. m.
it's diffuse
so it probably shouldn't be in there
the i. s. m. isn't a source type
is it
oh
no
i don't think so
what we doing about nebula again
i've forgotten
we're now including nebula aren't we
okay
yeah
mm what have we done features
features
mm yep
flat spectrum radio quasars
strong drop in the continuum
i think you're right there
okay
nope
i think you're right again
that's just the place
yep
we aren't doing emission line objects
um we're not doing emission line when it's a modifier of objects are we
oh no we aren't doing that either you're right
the question is are emission line objects a separate class of source
i think they are
mm no
but t y are you arguing not to have anything with object in it though
they aren't are they
yeah
yes you're right
so there goes
yeah anything to do with objects
so nothing
and seyfert galaxies w should be one you're right there
yeah
yes
i got three seventy
that's pretty good that's nearly a third
and you s speed it up as well i think
so
smile for the camera
great thank you
hello
yep
cheers
right
helium one
mm mm-hmm
i think there should be a break for and
sorry mm yep
it should be this one here
but i think maybe that one should be underlined
yeah it's hard to know what that is
that's this is a bit of h. t. m. l. goo
yeah
i think there should be a break for and
helium
and they don't know what to do with the h. t. m. l. goo
m. b. d. a. presumably is lambda
but this this isn't a s yeah
and this isn't a separate thing so i w i would agree that you underline the you underline the goo in each case but not the and
uh yes course of course it is yeah
and the in that case
yep
right
do you reckon this stands for lambda or yeah okay
yeah
yeah
okay
yep
right what's different
mm mm-hmm
just this
high excitation emission lines
mm
i think high excitation should be in because it's just saying
it's talking about the species that the emission lines are coming from
yes
yeah yeah
okay
right you don't get that
living up in nebulosity
eso i don't think is an instrument
eso isn't an instrument
okay
you're right
we agreed for to keep hubble
to not yes to keep hubble
yep
um for this that should be green as well
yeah that should be a source type yeah
it's
yeah do you think that's part of the name yeah
well it is the whole name yes i get
i don't yeah i have no way of knowing yeah
yeah i think it all is yeah i think it is all m one name
absorption line systems shouldn't be there
yep
yep
absorption line systems
and again
yep
right
needs column densities which is a derived property
mm yeah
yeah these are s s species ions again not individual lines
but then
yep that's fine
mm-hmm
and lyman alpha cloud shouldn't be in there either
nope
right
no
for some reason i seem to have just died on this one
i win
uh
he got bored
you're right there
okay
i forgot to keep track of the overall score like who wins and who lose
it's not a competition
yeah i know
yes
is there a prize at the end
uh
bottle of champagne
um okay
i've labelled that wrong
and here again
yeah and this one
mm that's a spectral feature that's okay
um it is
but is emission line a. g. n. a separate class from a. g. n.
um
ye
i don't think it is
i think a. g. n.
emission line a. g. n.
you wouldn't talk about
you can get a. g. n. without emission lines
but i don't think you'd particularly class them as a separate source
a separate source class
i think in phil's paper he does doesn't he
maybe you would
the paper i pointed you to a few weeks ago or last week
mm i didn't it i just looked at the plu
i didn't know what he meant but yes
i've seen people talk about them as separate classes but i don't really know what that means
and i guess there is a difference between uh an a. g. n. with emission lines and one without esp especially if it's x. ray detected
yeah
so yeah i'm happy with that as long as that's red as well which it is
mm-hmm
yep
um
oh
no
oh galactic stars
i think you're r you're right again there
mm 'kay
yeah that g. dwarfs are things aren't they
g. dwarf
presumably
that's alright yeah
never met one but don't know what it is
yeah
well it's one of them out um over here i think actually at the moment
right
so 'cause our sun is a is a t. dwarf
oh is it
there you go
i saw it yesterday
uh yeah
and cluster you're right
absorption
there he is
by lyman alpha forest and lyman limit systems
but it's the same lyman alpha forest systems again
so you're right there
yeah okay
or there maybe there shouldn't be any yeah i think should still be absorption
yeah
radio loud quasar again
you're right
mm-hmm
emission models definitely not
um why associated
i should definitely now we had a debate about this before and i can't remember why i decided to mark associated
mm-hmm
um what does it mean
yeah
it means it's associated with some physical thing but it doesn't have anything to do with the spectral features i don't think
does it
uh
what is as associated absorption
doesn't say it's associated with what
well it's a process though isn't it
isn't it a process
i don't know
mm-hmm
i've got no idea what it means
i'm happy to say m. two what not absorption is a spectral feature
yeah
yeah
but associated means it's associated to some physical thing
yeah
yeah
so yeah
i wouldn't have that
right okay
so is that what it means in that c context
so that shouldn't be in
right
um and associated again
alright
yep
those are mechanisms
mechanisms
so they don't count
don't think
um
yep i just missed it
quasar
and that's it
and we should've s put emission line features shouldn't we
hmm
yeah we should do
but we're not supposed to mark things we've done differently
so
yeah we did that the same
but it's different from what we've been doing
we've just talked about n und underlining features
well i think y bu y y you can actually mark it if it isn't altering what's in the manual
uh um it's only altering earlier rules
yeah
yeah and it's not in the manual is it
that aren't allowed
it doesn't say in the manual about features or not but we d when we saw ones previously we marked features
yeah then then do i think
yeah
mm-hmm
so let's do that
um yes
extend
yeah
the only problem it's done if we've both been not marking it there might be other instances in the text where it's not marked
yeah
y yeah yeah but yeah
well
w within the sentence that you sort of currently looking at um feel free to correct it that way that you'll do you know like it's not only about resolution but it's sort of like coming up with a corrected version based on these
mm-hmm
right okay
mm-hmm
yeah
yeah
okay
have you do you've seen that there are the other one there the quasar right
the uh right sorry
yes we've got quasars
yeah
and this is exactly the same as last one
systems
yep
i. m. galaxies
it's a kind of a regular galaxy
yeah
is it
okay
mm-hmm
just a p what are you doing there there sorry
hubble deep fields is being marked
and absorption shouldn't be marked yep
yep
isn't remote
yeah fine
yeah
i don't think able cluster is different from cluster
hmm
um yeah that's actually marked ex explicitly in here not to have a. bar clusters
an able cluster is just a a discover
ri right
yeah
so yeah
soft excess
that definitely gets to go in
that's not a component
no i i'm i'm not arguing
yep okay we can have soft excess
i think
i agree yeah
mm-hmm
yeah we could come to blows over soft excess
and yes you're wrong 'cause that's you're right 'cause that's extended emission and compton emission
okay
i think you're right on both of them
yeah
okay
um x. ray b. l. x. and radio b. l. x. i think are because the b. l. within should be marked so
yeah
i agree
that's fine
do you want this one here
mm-hmm
no
no
conti continuum
no for continuum
no continuum
no okay
um
c. o. luminosity
i think that's a s species again
yeah that's fine
mm-hmm
oh it's still too hot
uh i can agree with taking that out
um
intermediate is a region
that the so called yeah i don't think it should be should it
it shouldn't be highlighted you're right
because if if we talk about the broad line region we're not supposed to highlight it
'cause it's a region yeah
yep
it's the same it's just it's not very clear before the so called
yeah it's badly written
infrared galaxies
we said not to mark things based solely on
um
so it's just defined only by wave length
so we can't include infrared galaxies
yeah just galaxies
and
star bursts
star bursts count surely
yes they do
oh
yes assuming you're talking about star burst galaxies rather than star burst within a galaxy
mm yes yeah they are
but they are talking about star burst galaxies
and galaxies
galaxies
mm continua or continuum flux
mm
it's another one of those that doesn't really make a big difference
it doesn't really matter
but what did we decide
i'd say continuum flux but i don't obviously
let's keep flux in because it in most of these cases we've put flux in
but i don't care
yep okay
yeah i think you have
and the same as feature
mm-hmm
mm no i'm happy to take that out
broad line
i was gonna say put it in
oh
um the lack of broad line polarization
broad line polarization is that a spectral feature
i think you'd want the whole thing in some extent
mm no you can't point to it
ts you can't get it just from a spectrum
but you can if you've got a spectrum that's split by polarized light
yeah
yeah
yeah
well n i think i would actually leave it um with only th on those
as it is
br broad l
line in it
um because i think that's s what you have been doing earlier on
polarization's a property
yes okay
okay
yeah
yeah
yep
okay
now i d don't know what was marked here
have you got the bottom of this page
mm
or is it cut off
no
oops no
uh we're missing weak weak line
no
i said that weak line was
because the modifier should be included which i think it should
even though we claim radio galaxies i this should be underlined
this should be green
okay yeah
or actu actually sorry i think um the um this cut up page continues in the next side
oh right okay
okay
are we the same on the bottom line
yeah
characterised by unusually
right
okay so the question is oh no it's different
oh
no is it
yeah no you've got line in there
oh i've got line that's fine
the difference only weak line isn't it
m
line comes out and and should come out as well
and should come out
oh yeah
so there's a right but i think weak line should be in
there's a line there as well
it's different
hmm
and an and
okay mm-hmm
different as well
bec i in the same way that if you had broad line it would be in there
yeah
yep that's okay
right
galactic black hole candidates
they just made that up
yes
yeah
that's yeah exactly
and give it an acronym
g. b. h. c. ooh
that's not a source type
yeah i don't think that's a source type
mm okay
um line again
mm mm-hmm
but we've got emission line in the ratios
that's fine
infrared galaxies
yep
that's right again
oh no is it
no it's not right
no it's wrong
yeah
right
i'll get this
uh line emitting gas i don't like yeah
line
far infrared galaxies we can't have
and that's it
that's okay
making emission feature which we're including now
yeah that's okay
damped lyman alpha absorption the same
right yep
emission feature
mm-hmm
yeah that can't be in
star forming galaxies
no we can't
yep
star forming galaxies should be in
uh yes it should be
that's we did earlier anyway
yep that should be in
yeah
so
proto galactic lump
no they just made that up as well
that is not a source type
w not gonna get away with that one
no
what were you thinking
it's a lump
it's something
emission feature again
yeah
dibulae absorption
damp lyman
that should be because it's not an absorber it's an absorption
no but it says it covers a significantly small angular size
that's a process though
oh covers yeah
it's a physical thing
yeah it's a process or a source
i'm sorry
yeah you cross 'em out
get this out of the way
features
yep
uh this feature
a feature again
yeah okay
is a feature a spectral feature
alpha
damped lyman alphas again
yeah you don't get that
do you
those are those are regions globs nebulae
yeah
after and the rest is the same
yep
now a line should be in
yeah
x. ray b. l.
x. ray b. l. lax
yep that's okay
intermediate
intermediate types
it now if we're d
we put in type type one point nine
did we in the end
yeah
yeah
yes i think it should be in
oh right
you get it then
that doesn't go in and that's okay
mm-hmm
oh gosh this looks complicated
right that's okay
oh it's just it's lyman alpha absorption
we don't like systems
and we don't like that one
and we don't like that one
yeah that's okay
well hang on though
but wasn't there one just a minute ago in which only had a line
yes we are taking out line on its own
are we
so we ha yes
but you just
okay yep
every time
keeping lines there
yes i think we have to take in general every time there's been line where's there been line
so
what line are we taking out
okay it's line width but it's st it's still where it says lines
line width yeah
have we had any just where it says line ratios
line ratios
we've been taking out line as a
mm
word that relates to other words
adjective
my head is going yeah
uh yes
but lines are still lines
right
okay okay
yeah that's okay
hmm
yes i think you're right
okay
yeah okay fine
mm-hmm
right i agree that that can go out 'cause that's a fitting thing
no
we want the whole thing in there
absorption features in the u. v. spectra
or in the u. v.
i don't think spectrum should be there
but if it's a wave length or a wave band we were putting it in
okay
it's likely one spectrum in the u. v. which you can see absorption features in
yeah
yeah
uh right
quasars quasars
uh-huh
yep you're right
yeah i'm right
and here i think i'm right again
line centre you can point to
not like line width but you can point to line centre
in fact the whole thing should be highlighted i think
line centre
you can point to the line wings
yeah you'd you'd say line wings
alright you get it
mm that's just a
right you win
um eclipsing i don't think
yep no that shouldn't be in there
yeah you're right there
mm you're right star burst
oh star burst active star burst like activity that's i don't think that's a class
it's a action
y yeah but then the a. g. n. like activity
yeah
but a. g but a an a. an a. g. n. is a class
that has to go as well then surely
so both of them have to go
a star burst is a class
a star burst is a class
a star burst is a type of galaxy but it's also something that can happen within a galaxy
as is an a. g. n.
an a. g. n.
it's
but an a. g. n. is an object
the star burst you can't say here is a star burst
but we're counting star bursts as star burst galaxies
can't star burst if it means galaxy
if this means star burst galaxy like activity then that's fair enough
no but a star burst galaxy is only a galaxy which has a star burst in it
like an a. g. an active galaxy is just a galaxy with an a. g. n. in it
but star burst refers to
mm
wait fr from the linguistic side if you if you mark star burst before and if you feel that star bursts are like objects
i can see that
then i think it sh it should stay in in this case even though it's modified by activity or it's it's m modifying activity actually
mm-hmm
yeah
okay
let's keep it in
i think they're the same
i i think you're right anyway
they either have to both stay or both go and i i think they should stay
yeah
mm-hmm
yeah
hmm
yes i think it was ma maybe if it was star forming like activity that would be different
okay
yeah
but yeah
star formation we weren't putting in
yes that's right but star burst is different
okay
um we've just got this split up
i think there should be w h.
that
you're right it's two
or was it's a wave length region
it's a wave length region but it's tilt but you're saying between that line and that line
yeah
yeah
yeah
okay
i'm right here
um
that's part of a name yeah
you are yes
that's all part of the name
line ratios
mm 'kay
infrared galaxies
this time you have it
but galaxy should be in
but galaxies should be in
so we need to write that
right
um hold on
uh oh what have we done
oh no they are the same
sorry i missed that
absorption line systems
hubble
hubble
and hubble
and galaxy
yeah ok i in the galaxy distribution
galaxy distribution
still the distribution of galaxies
yeah
yeah okay
mm
um high ionization lines
yeah we did it before
yes
yeah that's okay
mm-hmm
oh
yeah okay
open that radius button
we weren't doing spectral shapes were we
yes don't include platt's spectrum
quasars
yeah that counts
low ionization
mm but three should be in
mm-hmm
um low ionization th they're low bals aren't they
um are they uh if you say so
well
low bal is a separate class of source
okay
yeah that's true
um i i don't know if high bals are but low bals are
that counts
they are and it's a big joke
okay
oh right yeah
high balls
uh yeah
yeah
um next
i shouldn't you're right there
yeah
yeah that doesn't go in
emission line candidates
that means objects that are identified and maybe at a particular red shift based on it
yes you're right
yeah
that doesn't count
continuum i think should be in aren't they
although i was talking about conti yeah continuum luminosity continuum flux it should be in
mm continuum luminosities
well you haven't been earlier have you
i thought we had we'd put in
i don't remember about luminosities
i don't think you were
uh
we've been putting in continuum flux
have you
oh okay
mm-hmm
yeah
okay
yeah we weren't doing broad band detections
we were doing yeah
mm
this is nice tea
mine too
oh
now what were we doing if
radio loud quasar should be in z. equals two shouldn't
it
and what were we doing
the rule was to leave it in was it
um
i don't know 'cause you in language speak mark each as a separate entity
that's different
yeah that's for things marked with and
mark sub sections of entities t no that's different
doesn't really say
yeah it doesn't say
so we need a rule for that
is is goo again or is it really z. equals two
what have we done t
z. equals two
z. equals two is um means at a certain distance
mm-hmm
um so that shouldn't be in but radio loud quasars is a thing
alright
so it's whether to include the z. equals two in the
mm-hmm
if it was radio loud quasar then you would mark it as one thing
yeah
yeah
yeah
i i think it makes sense to um mark the whole thing then as one
oh
as one okay
i don't know what you feel
okay
but
let's whatever's easiest for you
y um yes take it out
no
isn't it
the spectral components
yeah
no
x. ray binaries
mm-hmm
hubble deep field again
mm-hmm
mm no we can't have that
emission line objects shouldn't be in either of them
yep
radio quiet quasar should be go mm
a source type
yeah
i think that's right
now you've done one and not the other
oh
and you're right because one's line formation and one's line profile
yeah
um right
i. g. m. i've done again
this is nice and easy
yes
um yeah
components
yeah
um
we can rid of that can't we
yeah
i think so
mm-hmm
but we want the line still
the galaxy or galaxy
galaxy with the galaxy
given that it is the galaxy
it should be the galaxy i guess
it should be the galaxy yeah
insert proper whatever the word is
h. v. c. complexes
i don't know what h. v. c. stands for but since they're complexes we can cross it out
huh
do you know what h. v. c. stands for
h. v. c. is it this
uh
known to lie in the direction of high velocity clouds
no
that's where they are
high velocity clouds
yeah that doesn't count
they shouldn't be in there
there
that's right
yes but they don't explain
i. c. m.
mm-hmm
scuba
scuba that's an instrument
sometimes anyway when it works
you're right there
um
should be this and it probably is that's probably what that means
no but no you're right and this should be red as well
it should all be
oh i see
yeah
narrow line a. g. n. are different
i missed out that
right
beta line
h. beta l width
so
i don't think that matters very much
just keep h. beta i think
given that we're not putting line width itself
okay
even line if it is line width
you can have flux
hurray
um oh beta yep
h. beta should be in
mm no
not that line but we want enhanced
do we
why
we we wanted and this is relative we wanted modifiers of modifiers of spectral lines e. g. weak broad lines
but enhanced relative to what
i weak w relative to what though
it's all relative but it's still a modifier of that line
okay
and the same
um so sorry and the the a. g. n. i think that should be one entity right
the the uh w wasn't it that according to the uh acronym rule the first one
um
y yes that's right
mark the la la
mark the whole string as one entity
one acronym
no only when it's embedded
but when yeah
oh but the second one
oh it's included beside mark it all as one entity yes
yeah
yeah that's right
mm-hmm
oh i don't think i was doing that
uh
yes i don't know how many times i've missed the
yeah i've missed that a lot
mm-hmm
mm
um weak emission i think should be in there
yeah
okay
really
mm
if we're including it emission
if it was
are you
um
n
oh yeah extended emission is extended
we we've not been including extended emission
no
no that's true so we shouldn't have done either of those
so
no
yeah
but then weak yeah okay nothing at all
weak emission levels is just a way of saying yeah i agree
nor weak emission then
no
done
star burst contribution
that's not a separate source
yeah that's true
oh yeah
sorry
yeah
red continuum should be in
red continuum
okay
broad line emission and the rest frame u. v. should all be one
yeah
yeah that should be out
you're right yeah
oh
no it shouldn't
we weren't doing components
no
oh yes sorry you're right
so
yeah
lines
yeah this is this a radio transfer thing
so they don't mean they mean photons in the lines escape
not that that's not something you can point to
i don't think that counts
yes that's true
associated again which means nothing
mm
continuum source shouldn't be in
uh uh
and associated shouldn't be in
c. t. i. i. o.
mm that should be oh wait is that s that's an observatory isn't it
what does it stand for
yeah
the c. t. is the c. t. i. o. four metre uh the name of that telescope
that is a separate thing
um m uh y ye well i don't know
no
y yeah
and the a. a. t. is an observatory as well isn't it
yeah
but
so
yes but it's also a telescope and i think he if there's no other way of describing it that telescope
the c. t. i. o. four metre telescope is must be what it's called
otherwise they'd call it a name
hmm
that's the actually usually
yeah
but anyway
um
i don't mind
but we if we put
we're including observatory if it refers
if it's part of the proper name of an instrument
yeah
yeah
i gue i guess keep it then
but then we have to include four metre as well
yeah i think so
yes up the telescope
no just four metre
no
yeah
right
ion shouldn't be in there
yep i agree
mm-hmm
oh no it should
iron and absorption
is it contamination from blended iron and absorption lines
no it's not
what is that comma doing there
yeah no oh i see i see i see yeah
it's no it's not
i if the comma wasn't there it would be in
accounting for galactic reddening contamination from blended iron
what they mean is blended iron lines
blended ion lines yeah
so they do mean iron line
so so it should be in
yes you do mean ion lines
yeah
yeah
and we're keeping line in 'cause its strengths yeah
continuum flux we should have all in
continuum fluxes yeah we're doing that yeah
no
g oh
there're gonna be hundreds of those
least it's quick
uh yeah
um
damped lyman alpha q. s. o.
i don't think that's a separate class of quasar
but then i don't know about quasars
uh i don't know what that means either
i think it should p
one damped lyman alpha q. s. o. s
it's not a source type that's definitely true
no
yeah
that's okay
so
um the a. w. d. s
mm white dwarf
what's d. a.
um
and there's w. d. s
it's twenty five of d. a. type and six of d. b. type
yeah it's if it has
h h
hydrogen or h helium in the atmosphere of white dwarfs
okay so it is a different class
yeah
yep
okay
nope
yep
yes you're fine with that
low bal
mm i'd put multiple in there
we're not supposed to do components
no that's right
nope
i say neither of them
okay
that all goes
or yeah that's right
yeah
no absorption lines
no luminos
that should be highlighted
oh sorry i'm i me
yeah low luminosity q. s. o. s no
people talk about them a lot but
yeah i don't thin i don't think there was s but
well we're doing ultra luminous galaxies
yeah
so we should do
i guess you could keep it then
yeah
mm only if it's an astro physically distinct distinct
people discuss them as a separate class
they are as as much as ultra luminous galaxies are
yeah
okay
no absorption lines should be in and the same here
and yep that should be in
i didn't
nice not to do associated for once
excellent
regions
i you're
i shouldn't have done that
y yes you shouldn't
oh a. and b.
and we w oh gosh what were we gonna to do about a. and again
no that's the conjunctural
i'm right here i think
yes you are right yeah
if yeah
mm-hmm
strong soft x. ray flux
yeah you can point to that
yeah that's okay
uh
and that's associated absorption lines
oh
right
in the a. a. l. outflow it's a r yeah that doesn't count
but it's a region though isn't it
and absorption and small clouds is out
it doesn't count
ah now this is the conjunct rule again
and i've done blue wings of this and this and this
and i didn't ooh
how do you know what's going on here
yeah
and this is one double line
and this
yeah
and presumably that's red there
yeah i don't know what this means
it goes over there
i think i if the line's too long y you've highlighted all i as one
oh i highlighted all as one right
but and i've highlighted it separately
it should be separate
okay yeah
what what's this n. thing
because that is not marked in the
i think if the line's too long
it's only ha putting the bottom line because olivia would've marked from blue all the way to the end as one long line
ye ye
no sorry i mean the um so so most the
the n. should be
the n. as well
yeah yeah
uh yeah
yes but i think it probably was and just hasn't printed because olivia wouldn't have started marking at fourteen o. two
right
almo two lines above
mm
hmm
yeah but i think it's just m missing out the printing if the line goes over the end
yeah
oh i see
'cause if you look at you look at what olivia's done here olivia wouldn't have just highlighted that line
so your n. starts yep yep i see what you mean
hmm
yeah
right
she would have highlighted the whole thing
mm
but yeah
so n. probably should be highli
but it's s so you're mostly settling uh settling for for the uh solution where you mark all contacts individually
yeah and it's just hasn't printed that
yep
but it is marked i think
right
absorption components don't count
mm-hmm
continuum source does that count
shouldn't be
shouldn't be
mm oh so it is
that's right
but it's al is that also the name of the source
probably yeah
yeah
so it should be this one plus the pink
yep
uh line broadness
line broadness and i think that should be in
that's a way of saying line width though and we don't mark line width
that's true
well okay yeah
so we've been in here
alright
my table for now
oh
rich iron spectrum
rich iron spectrum
you're probably right
to the feature of the spectrum
does that make it a spectral feature
um
something that you can point to right
or
well kind of it it's uh uh d if you had a s sp spectrum
yeah
you have all the l lines of actually lots of different elements and you have to work out at all the ones sp which are ion lines
mm-hmm
then after that you look and say um ha has a lot of ion in it
mm-hmm
mm-hmm
mm
um
it's a feature of the whole spectrum rather than you can't say there is a rich iron spectrum you can say this is a rich iron spectrum
yeah
but b yeah i
yep that's the rich iron spectrum
oh i see
that's right it's it yeah
i agree let's get rid of it
so in that sense it's like like a derived property
yeah
yeah yeah
yeah i think so
yeah i see uh-huh
yes it's not a spectral feature
it's feature of the spectrum which is different
mm-hmm
right that's not shouldn't go in
mm-hmm
mm
yes
and then with the same
is that everything
yeah
okay
gosh we're getting through this now
yeah yeah we aren't gonna make it to our second cookie break
um giant ellipticals or ellipticals
i don't mind
we were inclu are you not
are giant ellipticals separate things
i don't know
yeah i think so
they are separate but are they a separate class
i think they probably are in the eta b. t. g. s and things
i think so
yeah
okay
yeah
line emitting gas doesn't get in
ionized emission
if you're doing emission from high yeah
yes i think you want ionized in there
really
really
you think
hmm
well she
you can point to ionized emission rather than
she was allowed emission from high excitation what not
hmm
and that's exactly the same
emission from high excitation lines
yeah that's exactly the same as
yeah
it it's pointing there and saying look there's a high excitation emission
and there's not high excitation
okay if you both think so
no
yeah
well i'm not certain if high excitation should go in but if high excitation should go in i think ionized means the same thing doesn't it
k
yeah
okay okay
so
mm-hmm
hmm
yeah you're right
line ratio
what's different there
oh there yes
you've got x. ray source r. one seventeen
narrow line seyfert one should all be one
with the red inside it
mm-hmm
that
no that's
this is describing the band you do the observations in
yeah
it's describing the line you're looking for
yeah i think so
yeah that counts
we've included it before when you've said this has been detected
alright
right okay
yeah
from i think should be in there
s
s yeah okay
e emission lines
yep
quasars i missed
yep
ooh
those shouldn't be there should they
no
damped lyman also is not systems yeah
oh okay okay okay
well hang on though but um
is it just um to s scrub your mechanism there
it isn't uh a spectral feature such as oh it's a process
ne yes
mm no i think it's a spectral feature
you can point to the damped lyman a alpha resorption in in the same way you can point to h. beta emission
although h. beta emission is a process
i think this is what we agreed to cross out before isn't it
or emission from h. beta is is a process
mm-hmm
no the damped lyman alpha absorption systems we crossed out
mm-hmm
we also crossed out
i think it's a process myself
i think it's a process too i think
especially when uh they're saying we're y we're choosing low red shift absorption
that's not really something you can point to
what did we do back
mm you can point to low red shift damped lyman alpha absorption 'cause you're shifted in the spectrum there
mm
i'm not too fast i don't think
um
would it be if it was h. beta absorption
and you just took out the low red shifts
quasars with h. beta absorption you'd put in
mm no i'm not sure
because it's a spectral feature
i think damped lyman alpha absorption
it's whether it's a process or a a feature
but i can't remember what we've done before
i think it's both
because we've every feature is produced by a process
well if it was if it was absorption and damped lyman alpha clouds you'd not mark absorption
yes it's depends whether it has t whether it means with low red shift damped lyman alpha cloud absorption
if it was damped lyman alpha absorbers that would be different
but i think absorption
i do think it's a process i think
it's a process but it also produces a spectral feature where you can say there's the damped lyman alpha absorption
there's the in the same way that the yeah h. beta emission is a process
yeah
well that's true
hmm
that is true
mm
yeah
well we've both marked it
so let's leave it there
yeah i think it should be in there
yeah okay okay
micro quasars
micro quasars
they're dubbed micro quasars
yeah
that means it's new fangled
is it gonna be a decent source type in the future
i haven't heard referred to since
but
yeah
but just talk about the micro quasar
yeah but they've made up that word
yeah i think you're right they have ma
mm on the other hand if we're having hyper luminous galaxies where you know they've just got ultra luminous and oh even more hyper luminous
yeah
well someone must have made that up for the first time
but w do they what defines a micro quasar
i think
same as a hyper luminous galaxy being very very extreme
but
i guess keep it probably yeah
i reckon a dwarf amorphous nuclei star burst galaxy a dance is a yeah okay
no they've made that one up certainly
i've never heard of that one before
uh yeah you y there's not been more than one study of dwarf amorphous nuclear star burst galaxies
no
so that do we say we take that out
but what about the acronym because that's has that should be in
yep that's it in it
so that's okay yep
star burst nuclei
you're right
oh
the object
oh
if it was star burst galaxies it would be in there
star burst nuclei refers to a region within an object which would not be observed separately
yeah that's right
oops
yeah i wouldn't yeah
um
yep that's fine
sorry what what happened now
okay
so you you f you found that dwarf amorphous blah blah galaxies that that's not a proper name
but you still include the acronym
or
because the acronym has star burst in it uh galaxies in it in the s. and if the acronym includes its
oh okay
alright okay
then it has to be in there
i see mm-hmm
continuum flux you can have
mm-hmm
u. v. and optical emission line ratios
yeah
but
i think all of that goes then doesn't it
surely
we wouldn't have line ratios
no
so yeah that goes
u. v. and optical emi u. v. and optical emission should be in there though
no it shouldn't 'cause it it modifies the ratios
no i don't think anybody goes
yeah
no it modifies ratios
yeah
oh gosh no emission l okay so i've highlighted this in r red and then the whole thing in green because type two seyfart galaxies are one
mm
right
yep that's fine
so i think that's right as long as this is
plus red
yeah
t. v. gamma ray emission
we weren't doing broad band detections
we weren't doing broad band detections yeah
mm no
right
using the
that's definitely an instrument name
it is yes
very stupid but it is
right you're right there
f. b. s. objects shouldn't be in there
what does it mean
i don't know but it's got object
yep you're right
and the mama scanning machine is an instrument it's not a telescope it's an instrument
it's an instrument yeah
yeah
okay
so you can have that
right
at the other one we stopped after four metre
so maybe we should do that there as well
oh yes it should be
narrow emission lines from high iron yeah
yeah
we did it this way before
absorption features
weak continuum
yeah you're right
that should be separate
continuum radiation
continuum radiation
no
neither
neither
mm-hmm
narrow line region emission
yep
uh do you th i think that goes out
oh there's emission from the narrow line region yeah
yeah we don't
narrow line emission should be in
yep
uh yep white dwarfs is a source type
yeah you're right
f. v. low bal is a source type
stupid keckers
it is
uh
you used to b oh no keck observatory
yes we did decide keck was going in
keck is yeah
uh we didn't allow iron spectrum
so we shouldn't allow h. or helium two o. spectrum either
yeah that's right
at all yep
and we shouldn't allow emission
yeah
iso electronic
yeah
radio quasars
radio quasars are s type
yeah
oh no radio loud and radio quiet are
but radio quasars means radio loud quasars
yeah
u. v. accessors are right isn't it
mm-hmm
it's a spectral feature
we weren't doing flat spectrum quasars were we
um
no
were we
ye i think they're a separate class yes
we're not putting them in spectral but i think we are putting them in because it's so broad band
right
but yes they are separate
right
uh you're right there
line strengths
no you can't point to it yeah
means equivalent widths yeah
uh i did mis group
missed group
yep
subaru telescope you're right
that's it
it's under a proper name 'cause it's got a capital t.
hurray
hey
hey wow
excellent
yeah
well very good
hurray we're done
wonderful
under two hours
excellent
amazing
well once we've got them identified a lot of them were the same problem going round and round
yeah
yeah
yeah
yeah
um where's the bin in here
and more to the point can i get to it without going ah i can carry my little bits in the with me
no you can't
excuse me camera i need to find the bin
um and there isn't one is there
oh
do we each remain wired up
are we done
i think that's it isn't it
i th i think so yeah
we're done
excellent
right
uh yeah
so we've moved over and onto the other eye link
okay
so uh 'cause she's running at the moment
yeah
i mean m my view on this was that um the need for people to back up their data personally was made sufficiently clear to lab users
um i mean i guess right okay
she did admit it
as long as she admits it then then that's fine
yes
uh-huh
i i'm just thinking you know sometimes when there's a a process error like that you think oh then there's something we should change
like make the sign in bigger red letters
but i in the our case i don't think there's anything more we can do really
hmm
no
so um well i doubt anybody'll do that again 'cause that'll get around
but ma
yes
so
shock and worry at uh i think yeah there's a there's a mailing list uh and mm-hmm yeah
yeah
yeah we'll go we've got the mailing lists out now isn't isn't it
so it's everyone should know about it now
yeah there was a mailing list before
they've just revived that right
uh f frank went through it deleted the people that were have gone or or whatever and replaced them
so the the eye the the list is now updated
right okay
yeah
so so everyone on that list has now being reminded
uh-huh
yeah don't store anythi anything sensitive on yeah don't store anything you you care about on the machines
mm-hmm
right
mm-hmm
so
yes uh
and we don't know so there's every chance of this falling over again if it's a hardware thing right
yeah with the yeah i mean i di i di i did do hard dri hard drive check um and a memory check
but there's not much we can do about that apart from
right
and it says there's no uh there's no problems but something caused it to go wrong in the first place
yeah
why is uh-huh
so we don't know we don't know
yeah yeah
we'll just fingers crossed and hope ho yeah ho hope that all this is just a software thing that we can just fix like that and that'll be it
mm-hmm
uh-huh
yeah
so how long does this put you back for
is it you know
how much disruption does this cause
hmm
d is this a day
two days
yeah
we're doing a bit
see last week by the time everything and and then it'll be hopefully no more than i don't know what twenty minutes today to
day and a bit
yeah
yeah yeah
uh-huh
yeah i mean there's there's so what we yeah one one for one
to actually do the re install
one we'll try and get done today yeah get get windows back on there
you c
try and get camtasia on there and get that tested out
and then that will be i think that's everything we need f before we can before you can start running the experiments isn't it
hmm
yep
mm-hmm
so
and i saw uh a bunch of stuff about software updates
that's un unrelated to this problem right
i i yeah
you mean from was that joe
um the eye link
or is that
i c i didn't read 'em
i saw like five messages go back and forth
maybe they were under the wrong subject header
um there was nothing nothing over last week
so anyway we have well
joe has uh produced another version of the uh model builder and put that up
oh no i mean the eye link software
uh well that wa that was ruud well a few weeks ago
but yeah
so it's unrelated it's not that right
yep it's unrelated
okay good
um
and was r was running
'cause frank did all that because he then had an experiment
so he's run an experiment and it's all worked
yeah
yep
so uh i uh did he get his data in
or is this put his schedule back
uh he's he's done his and got his and yes
he's done it okay
and he backs up anyway
yep
right
um well unfortunate but it sounds like um you guys are well placed for dealing with it
maybe too well placed yeah
so better you than me
yep yep
uh but uh yeah
no i have to manage to get at things working on on monday
so that that everything went down like on the tuesday morning
um so my m i should get everything working on the um yeah on monday
so sure that the j. c. t. is actually working collaborating collaborating between the two machines
yeah
um i had dinner i wasn't actually at dinner but i d have the eye tracker stuff working 'cause it was just me running roun running round the lab
um still have to once it's re installed have to actually do a proper p yeah of proper pilot and yeah
oh so you need to borrow somebody's head and mouth and stuff to to run it right
yep
yeah
but um but it loo it looks like it was doing all the calibration and drift correction things that s ellen was wanting on it
and
so so that don't think there's anything to add to the software for that part
yeah
mm-hmm
um
so i've got a new um trainee who might need amusement at some point
so if you need to borrow a head that talks that doesn't necessarily need to do much else
i'll th i'll ask her if she'd mind coming down and helping you out for uh a while
but i guess ellen was gonna be your the p the person who yeah your spare head
wh a spare head
or uh yes but she's not around
right
so uh
yeah
so um uh mine is well she's actually climbing ben nevis today i think
but uh she'll be uh back tomorrow
her name's nynke
did you guys meet her
don't think so
mm
nynke
this seems the sort of thing that people might might find i find amusing to look at
don't s don't sound don't sound familiar
mm-hmm
so um i i'll i'll see if if she'd be willing to
mm
well i did meet uh uh uh uh someone from another project of yours on wednesday evening it was
oh who is that
hei heidi who is the gesture of autism
oh yeah heidi
oh yeah she's good
yeah mm-hmm
you guys might actually have something in common 'cause she does well you know stuff for the video coding and gesturing
mm yep
and autism
but
and autism yeah
so okay
uh right what am i writing
uh okay nynke to volunteer
yes
sh she's been volunteered
well uh no uh i will actually give her the the option
but um it sounds like the kind of thing where you know
i think it's quite useful when you're at that stage to see the different kinds of technologies people use
yeah
so
yeah so i'll try and try and get camtasia up and running so i can try it out when when when we've got her coming in
and we'll just sort of do a run through of proper pilot just to just just so i can see th
yeah
yep make sure it uh it starts and finishes when it's meant to and that sort of thing as well
mm-hmm
yep
yep
um yeah i'll make sure make sure they can actually pick up the f um audio signal as well
mm-hmm
uh so but uh it should be the yeah the audio signal should be coming out the speakers once it's set up properly
uh yep
so that should that should make that slightly easier
mm-hmm
uh yes with the um the bleep was a hardware bleep originally
and so it comes from the p. c. which is outside the sound proof box
oops
well you found that then
yeah yep
yes
uh but yeah so they're fortunate have speakers o on the monitors inside the room
so as long as and what we'll have done is just gonna set up so the uh whatever the asterisk sound is on windows is what gets played
h mm-hmm
it comes through the
so so just change sound to whatever you like just go through the windows control panel
right
okay
so we want one you can pick up using matlab or something right
yep yeah so i'll i'll have that running over the weekend
yeah yep
aye
um so la last week i tried it with a one kilo hertz sound
um and it was it c it could detect it but it wasn't but but it wasn't very clear
did it with ten kilo hertz and it's just really clear where you can tell exactly where exactly where the beep is now
okay
perfect
so yeah
so tha it's ju just a matter of um yeah you just ba basically just play it
just play a ten kilo hertz sound over the over the speech and then just um compare the two signals basically
um so i've i've got a little script for doing it
so so yeah yeah
perfect
so or you're gonna bank the script some place and tell us how to run it
yep yep not a problem
mm-hmm
uh-huh
'cause we won't know
no
right
well that all sounds good
uh um what else
you have altered the um task programme because uh to put the um little eye icon and the mouse uh to make it
yep yeah the the one the one in just installed should have that now
um we'll double we'll double check and re install on software on the on the um eye tracking machines
but yeah it should uh should be updated without any
so
rather than just a blob uh ellen wanted something to look more like an eye so that you knew that was the eye
oh really
there was like yeah mm-hmm
oh okay
yeah so so so we've got like uh a big circle with a white circle in the middle of it for an eye
and we got like a rectangle with two like rectangle buttons on it for a mouse
uh-huh okay
so
very nice very pretty
it doesn't get in the way of seeing what's underneath
uh no they're they're they're the same size as the as the original blobs basically
version one
mm-hmm
but um so they uh yeah i think the mouse is slightly bigger but it's not you know it's not it's not hugely bigger
it's not too bad
so
uh-huh
i c i can i can see where that's useful
yeah
and if it ever ever gets to be a problem in the pilot i can easily reduce the size of whatever
no
just change it
mm-hmm
'cause that's not too hard
want it a reasonable size so that if they're looking at it we know they're looking at it though
so
so you has to be a a reasonable target uh for the for the tracking purposes
yeah
yep
yeah
although if if you had a big thing and it was jiggling around like anybody's business
like real eye track traces then you might find that a little bit disconcerting
i mean small things you kind of expect to jiggle around right
mm-hmm
but
with large mm yeah i suppose the larger more oscillation appears that um it's not w i mean uh it isn't it isn't it isn't that big
it'll look like it's quivering you know
yeah
so yeah
yeah but well that's all fine
what else
uh i'll try it
you were saying joe with the model builder
uh yes he's produced an another version that doesn't uh have the overlap problem
oh remind me
you know there was the yeah the collisions
oh yes
okay
the polygons now don't overlap
oh that's good
um marloes discovered something strange about the orientation of parallelograms from when it was constructed to when it appears in the um actual task
but i think that might be something to do with the original configuration than the parts that weren't the same across the two
so i'll check that out uh to see if it really is a problem or not
oh okay
and basically the parallelogram was appearing in a sort of as a mirror image of what it was like in the uh model builder in the actual yeah
really
just total it flipped uh in in a mirror image
not rotated
so it wasn't anything to do with rotation
just the parallelogram
it was f yeah just the parallelogram
so uh entirely sure
must be some way of how the vertices were described or uh defined in one way or compared to something else
right
okay so you your job in this is to um ensure that it actually is a bug and then pass it to joe
joe yep
okay
that makes sense
i mean the this geometry stuff is really tricky if you don't do the fold the boxes stuff in your head well so i can imagine
well uh mm-hmm
'cause i could get it backwards easily you know and so it is just as well for w for you to check this
yes
uh the other thing we've done is uh looked at n not uh for this current experiment but for future
when we've got to build um bizarre parts like air craft wings and and things
uh something like x. fig uh can output the vertex points um for creating the air the actual polygons in the first place
uh-huh
yeah yeah
'cause the model builder um assumes that there's an existing set of of original parts
yeah so you need to draw 'em in something
so you need to draw them in the first place
oh so yeah i suggested you do that in x. fig
so
is that a reasonable thing to do or no
it it i yes
yeah yeah
so so you can you can do it in x. fig export them as s. v. g. and you just get a you just get a list of x. y. coordinates
yep mm-hmm
um and then i'll just write in a little script that turns those x. y. coordinates into a part
yeah
so this is this falls down completely if nijmegen can't run x. fig
so you better check that with 'em right
w or something i i uh uh
well the thing is it's s. v. g.
so so long as i've got something that will output s. v. g.
but
okay but they may need help finding the something if they can't do x. fig i suppose
yeah yeah
so i'll als i'll also have a look have a look at that
but the there's there must be plenty of windows things for th that i o output s. v. g.
yeah
so it must be a some sort of pink package
min uh i kno i know i know
uh
microsoft though
i mean well what kinds of
um i kn i know adobe and things have faculties that do it
but obviously they're like a few hundred pounds
they are the paid
yeah and
um so oth but other i i'd b i'd be very surprised if there wasn't a free package for doing it
um i ha i have a feeling that the um amaya the w. three c. browser does it
uh-huh
yep mm-hmm
have a feeling that that can actually edit s. v. g. files
okay
so i wouldn't do any any work to find out what'll output s. v. g.
just ask them look you know say we you need something that does s. v. g. and then um if they if they come back and say ha
then y you may need to poodle around a bit looking for something
but uh you know let them let them say they've got a problem before you um spend time trying to figure out what'll do it
yep yep
yeah
yeah
yeah
'cause
and it's not it's not an immediate problem anyway
yep fair enough
but i thought it was worth before joe disappears just checking that the model builder's not restricted to just doing the tamgrams
or something tha you know
uh-huh
yeah yeah
so uh no it does look like it's uh m. s. n.
oh so well i can imagine there being uh shapes that you could construct in s. v. g. format that would fox the model builder in some way
i don't know i mean it 'cause you don't have specs about what sorts of shapes are allowed right
um no but as long as they're solid polygons it should be alright
um right it doesn't matter whether they're um convex or concave in funny ways
uh no it sh well uh uh hopefully that's not what the parallelogram problem is
because it it does have sort of sum of angles and things
yeah ex
but uh no as far as uh i mean it
yeah
um when will yeah but no i'll i'll create a c i'll create a convex part um just so next week um ju yeah
mm-hmm
but it just it it just just happened to be a convex part that i was that i was i was playing with
and you tried it
yeah
yeah
yeah yeah
so it it handled that fine
or part of it was convex
um it didn't have any self intersections so that might be a problem
yeah
so i'll just have to have check that
but
would we want by self intersection you mean you could
yeah by by a by a part of it crosses over itself
um s so it's sorta like a b
you mean like
i y yeah but that's why uh we no we'll only be working as i say with sort of solid obvious polygons and as parts
'cause they'll have they'll have to have a central point anyway for for rotation and and grabbing
yeah
yeah yeah
well but by self intersection here i'll draw here if i can find the right end of the pen
but
y do you mean something like that
yeah that sort of thing
yeah
mm-hmm
yeah
so
a and you can rule out something like that right
well uh uh realise what we're i would consider that two parts yep
'cause that's two parts for you
yeah
um i mean you know some f rainy day you might wanna think about
well i don't know
i mean it you know later on we can fix it if it if it turns out those parts it's not urgent now
yeah
if if it if it becomes a yeah
i think this isn't important enough
yeah
yep
yep
yeah
yeah so for now we'll just just assume that non interse non intersecting um and um yeah
and then there's this at the moment the e the s. v. g. stuff can output ones which aren't closed polygons
but um ones ones you ones that actually had turn up into parts list uh it creates a closed polygon by linking the l end point to the start point
the last point to the yeah
yep mm-hmm
so so uh yeah so as long as long as they're yeah
mm-hmm
so so so as long as they're they're drawn well enough it should be alright
so um but yeah
uh-huh
yep
suppose let nijmegen uh find their find their own s. v. g. sort of find something that does s. v. g. and then we'll see if there's any problems
yeah
yes yeah
but but but if they have trouble you know half an hour googling and helping helping them is probably worthwhile
'cause someti sometimes people i mean it actually i would e i wouldn't expect them to have any trouble finding something 'cause j. p. is quite up with all the all these things
yeah yeah
j. p. is quite yeah uh-huh
so um are th
yeah
but it mi it might be worth just checking what software they are using 'cause it might crea it might create outputs slightly different from x. fig
well you let's um encourage them not to use um any software that might have idiosyncratic ideas about what s. v. g. is
so
she says delicately
yes
i have no ooh that i wasn't gonna say
the microsoft version of s. v. g. or something
yes uh-huh
i i have no idea whether they have idiosyncratic s. v. g. output or whether but um their track their track record could uh on some of the other standards has not there have been slightly strange things about it
i have no idea either
uh
so um but in my uh you know i mean they sh that should be if
yeah
that should that should be fun
yeah i think it does s. v. j. uh s. v. j. output
um so i'll i ca i can easy double check if uh nijmegen can't find anything
mm-hmm
so
um yeah
i haven't looked through other mail
i did see something from marloes
is there anything they're waiting on from us that is a problem or i they reasonably happy at the moment
nope
uh i think they've um they're not waiting anything from us
uh they've dumped the pilot the pilot studies that they generated based on the task with their english participants or english speaking participants
oh they've done the pilots
yeah
oh good
uh but they haven't done anything with it other than dump the data
dumped the data
where is it dumped
uh they well they dumped it on the mm b. s. c. c. w. server
b. s. c. w.
but i've moved well i haven't moved it i've copied it onto the c. s. v. yeah
well that's okay
you know we're not using that much space if it's just for interim
and they have to get out to us some way
yep
um uh we had a uh brief discussion just before i left about uh this idea of exchanging data by fire wire drive and i do i don't know if that ever got resolved
but you know that's not that's not fast enough for little things like this
nothing further is
so i think b. s. c. w. is the right way to exchange these
no
mm-hmm
mm-hmm
we just have to wipe this stuff off and keep separate copies after that
uh
and i've uh sent a thing off to marloes talk trying to encourage her again to register for the c. s. v. and uh and what to the c. v. s. and uh wha what to do and uh which bit of software i use that seems to be quite easy and simple
the c. v. s.
oh so you're managing that okay and you haven't run into c. v. s. before
yep
nope
okay
well yes and no as in yes it's new and no i haven't got a problem
well good
yeah yeah yeah
yep
well that's that's reassuring
oh so far
yeah
yeah
course he's sitting on the next desk
uh-huh
uh y yes
yeah
uh and i am just using it through um a windows bolt on sort of piece of software
yeah but other than that that was easy enough to install though wasn't it
it was yeah
yeah
no i've just yeah straight forward and then you just right right yeah r and right click things in in windows explorer
copy and paste the stuff out the off off the wiki
so
that's it
mm-hmm
yeah
well she'll have to u use the c. v. s. eventually 'cause we don't really have a good way of doing this otherwise
but
yeah
yeah i mean uh also double checked in that we're not gonna w could access the c. v. s. from home when i was working from home last last week
um on thursday i managed to managed to get in and just just check the stuff and make sure it was all make sure th make sure ma make sure i could access it
mm-hmm
so they shouldn't have any trouble accessing it once they've got the log ins
well that's it we'll never see him here again
so not yet i'm afraid
mm-hmm
watch i'll find out he's got a better computer at home as well right
on a day like this i know it's a yeah
right and what about um the project as a whole
is there anything that ruud or anybody is after that we aren't supplying
mm no
not at the moment right
not at the moment
the only thing that's been going around is the version of the flier
i don't know what real purpose of uh these little folded up a. four fliers
uh there's been bit of uh are they just for distribution at conferences and things
they're they're critical the to the success of a project
so
or do they uh
y uh yeah and general places
but yeah i wouldn't worry too much about it unless they ask you for specific input
right
well i i'm not really bothering
yeah
but it there's that's what's circulating around the the group as a whole at the moment
that's what's circulating
uh-huh
um i've sorted out uh travel et cetera to munich for e for ellen john and myself
oh yeah
and we're all off on the fourteenth of december
mm-hmm
coming back on the friday
and john's going
the sixteenth yes
mm-hmm
oh that's good
he'll be useful for the w. p. seven stuff
so
well while you do that i'll be trained in how to hire people
so
that's a so that's how to hire or how to interview is that that uh book
uh both
so
so is there anything else
what have you got on for the rest of the week besides getting this stuff up and running again
uh well on once uh once i've tried out the camtasia stuff i'll see if the if there's any problems gonna tr gonna try and fix them
if there isn't any problems
next time i'm working on this uh g. d. f. stuff um so so i've i've i pu uh put on a d. t. d. and a sample x. m. l. file on the wiki for the g. d. f.
yeah
so it's ba based on some stuff you put on there on the g. d. f. specification
right
um
so are you concerned about it that i should be looking at it or you happy with it
i mean i sort of wrote the initial draft of it i suppose
the
so
yeah i mean with i cha i changed a couple of things from your original draft
um so there's not uh there's no longer a separate thing for creating new parts
so just put a start and end time on each part
uh so
um uh slower
so the the you you you had a you had a thing call i think it's mould or so or something that you said which is sort of to create a new part
there's an action to create a new part
uh-huh
um but i th uh i've i gave each part a start time and an end time um so you can see when the parts were created
so i'm not su so i'm not not sure if you wanna keep the mould or not
okay
uh
um i'll have to look
i can't remember um how this works now 'cause it was a while ago
yeah but it's it's just the g. d. f. specification page on the uh on the wiki
so
i've uh i mean i'll try try to put in justification for for the change that i made uh on the page
so um but i've i've sent it out for review so that s anyone who is gonna using the format can have a look at it
yeah and you'll get nothing back unless i look at it right
huh
so i best for for us for me to do that
i i um yeah i i mean it's really good that you're y um putting things out for for review and saying like why for stuff
but um we don't we also don't want um to burn too much of your time recording stuff that that nobody's ever gonna look at necessarily
so i mean this this might be a good case for or it might uh or it might be that you should just like you know
talk to me about this stuff if i happen to be around at the time that you're doing it and not y so i if the writing stuff down on the wiki gets to be too high a proportion of things
then then you don't necessarily wanna do it
you do you know what i mean
right
yeah yeah yeah
the so um i th i think it's great to have the records and that's really important
mind when the
spend
mm-hmm
especially in in big dispersed groups but this is kind of a smaller group
um so it you know we can do things more informally where f you feel the wikis are getting in the way of things
yeah
so
well the ones that this stuff i mean is it's helpful
it was helpful for me to putting it up on the wiki 'cause i could actually thin think about it as i put it up and say well this is this is why and th this is why i wanna do things this way
oh yeah it well if it aids you in thinking to write it down then definitely write it down
um so
yep yep
'cause yeah we want clear thinking
um i can't actually remember uh i how it worked with the the moulds
mm-hmm
i mean i w i wanted to make sure that um
no i can't even remember
so i'll i'll look at it
well mm-hmm
yep
fair enough fair enough
uh but uh i'm sure it's fine 'cause um it's just my memory of things
uh what el uh well i'll have to get to grips with cra camtasia uh properly uh to generate a little sort of introductory video i suppose uh for instructional purposes at the beginning of the experiment
yeah
yeah
so people will be able to see uh and so that the p you know example movements uh and things like that will be
oh yeah uh-huh
yeah
so um is that gonna have a voice over or is it we had discussions before you started about whether it should be completely silent so that they could use in case we ever wanted to do this in in dutch
in dutch as well
yeah
um well
and uh and so you know
you could just have sort of well the i think we discussed having it with an english voice over or having it with no voice over and then having it w just with cartoon noises or something like or you know when things break
oh right
oh
huh
right
so to emphasise the i may be imagining it
uh no that must have been before me
mm
so uh uh uh p it
well uh well i kn i know on camtasia if you got a ca if you've got a camtasia project
i
you can have the video and audio stored separately
separated
in which case
oh so we could produce a dutch voice over for the same thing
yes mm-hmm
yeah
yeah
so yeah
yep
so so we just ended the just ended the the dutch stream yeah the video and our audio
and then they can easy create their audio out of mm from that outp
mm-hmm
yeah
exa yeah
yeah
so the i mean th i don't think i think it'd be more sensible just to do the non the the video part of it first and then you add the voice over afterwards
yeah
rather than trying to do all at once
you know
okay the oth the other issue is um uh i if we do a voice over uh does that affect the language that the people choose to use
yeah yeah
might use
or are you going to prime them in any way
s so that might be another reason for not doing that
doing uh anything with the voice you know
if you start talking about have to avoid or uh yeah talking about the parts or just naming them or anything like that
alignment or you know
yeah
mm-hmm
so i think maybe that was another reason for um just having
or or or ding for you know you got it or i don't know what
bef yes
okay
yeah
or did no n no noise in fact i think is probably uh yes
uh pro probably actually not even the sound effects 'cause otherwise they'll expect that in the real experiment and that doesn't happen
yeah
yeah yeah yeah
so if they make move a piece and it breaks and they don't hear this crash and they go oh what's you know what's happened
well that y
yeah
yeah
is that really all what happened
yeah it's uh
well you need some way to make sure that they actually notice the thing you're trying to explain to them if there's no voice uh
mm-hmm
yeah mm-hmm
yeah
well one thing uh one one thing that camtasia can do you can have little videos when other haven't gotten got any cameras for doing that
but you could like have videos of people click on the mouses and sorta or whatever else mm-hmm
hmm
or or you could just point to you know have b great big arrow that points at the two pieces that broke
mm-hmm
yes i think it can generate uh things
you know and
you can do yeah you can generate call outs and whatever
so the might yeah i'm sure there must be a way of putting big arrows ov or whatever
uh-huh
yeah
um
so you gonna clear or r however you do this with ellen right
'cause she's the one that has thoughts about the language and stuff
yes
mm mm-hmm yeah
yes but uh or in our discussion we haven't mentioned uh it was assumed there'd be a voice over
but i'll i'll i better i'll i'll remind her yeah i'll i'll i'll do that
oh well remin remind her that there was a question about whether there oughta be one
mm-hmm
yes 'cause we've got to think of the instructions and sort of basic introduction to it all as well
so
mm-hmm
actually i i did email nijmegen to ask if they'd had a set of instructions they'd given their participants
i bet marloes just talked to 'em
but it probably i s i suspect so because i haven't had a reply back
ah i think it's really up to us to
yeah too too uh it was just in case they had something that what
is it hard
you don't wanna give 'em the specification you know 'cause that's in too high falutin a language
mm-hmm
but um oh i it can't be that hard to generate something that says
no that should be a problem
i'll be straight forward enough i think
mm-hmm
oh um uh on my holidays we encountered a children's toyshop where there we there were tamgrams
and my son reminded me that he ca hasn't been able to find his tamgram set in a while
alright you want take it back
well uh if not if you guys are using it
um oh uh t uh no um th it's not got it's uh yeah it's i well b actually i could probably just photo copy the manual
or do y do you find it helpful to have it
and there's only a
oh but it's so tactile to have the little metal bits
um yeah
if you if you're using it keep it
he's got plenty of toys
if you're not if you're not using it then i'll take it back
right
yeah
right
uh oh i've hopefully well i won't hopefully need it for more than another week or two anyway
so as long as you can hold off his no no
yeah y it's not it's not a worry
the the lad has plenty of toys
right
um i i was looking at the the complexity sort of uh aspect of the tamgrams in that uh booklet
it's not quite that they just get harder
oops
it's that they kind of have pages of similar um types
oh similar types uh-huh
yeah
so one page will have sort of parts that are kind of similar to each other and then you move over and there's a different almost type of design or style
yeah
uh so it's not quite as progressive in complexity as uh
right
so um how you gonna get your complexity ratings
google
no
google
is there a big tamgram community that ranks these things
like you know that's just one booklet that came with one set of tamgrams
mm-hmm
uh i'll try i'll try
or or is it obvious like when you look at these things
you never know what's what's out there
well uh um i'm hoping the dutch input will allow us to p sort of have a rough idea of what was the of a suitable complexity for the task
yeah
but that still won't tell you well how many tamgrams are there that they're using
fifteen or something
no not even
uh no not even that
they've of this relevant type to what we're wanting to use probably three
uh-huh
uh we've to generate sixteen in total
so that's not gonna g so that's not gonna tell you anything about relative complexity
that's just gonna tell you where in the span you wanna be
mm-hmm
you still need some kinda scale for these things
yeah ideally
ca uh if you look at 'em do you just know
mm no
no
i would either
well i don't
i'm not
what about him
i if h mister geometry
no i'm an af afraid not
i mean you know
can you tell just by looking at these how hard people find them
or right okay
i wouldn't know
no
no no
well
uh i'll tr i'll try the good old google and see if there is uh if there are some sort of ranking sites or whatever
that's a s that's psychology thing how hard they
who is psychology already uses tamgrams that's still around
uh
mean people have been using tamgrams for ages
so there must be somebody with a folk wisdom you can contact
i'll try and find out
i don't know off off hand certainly
right
i only know ancient papers
so like late eighties
uh i'll i'll do a search
do people still use tamgrams
b um i've not encountered them
oh
so we're very old fashioned
mm well or maybe they just don't use mm anything like that i suppose for
well there was stuff in the seventies and the eighties right
so since then
but i'm not sure if anything's happened since then
right
well the old the old tasks are the best
so i'm not gonna let that worry me
um
so uh sorry that was k i think a big diversion
and we were talking about what you were gonna do next after all this stuff was up and the i was gonna look at the g. d. f. spec
are the rest of the y uh are is the rest of what you're to do with that software fairly clear
'cause this is about the analysis
yeah yeah so this yeah
you really only need robin right to to specify the rest
yes yes
he'll he'll just be working with robin on what analysis we need to get out of the g. d. f. format
um so i'm gonna c basically i've got a the gest analyser's the base the basis for uh um ascii to g. d. f. converter
um so what i'm gonna do is actually create an output uh a g. d. f. output part to it
uh-huh
um 'cause at the moment uh only outputs the video
um but it does have internal structures will just make it easy to do the the x. m. l.
yep mm-hmm
yeah
so so that's that's what i'm gonna look at
and then once i've done that i can look at the whatever analysis we need to get done out of the g. d. f.
yeah 'cause there were all these issues about how you calculate eye eye lag and you know
mm-hmm
w what other th analyses we want o want out of this that aren't settled
but i think um you know robin is the person who knows the most about what's required there
and i can imagine it's gonna take a wee while to i can imagine you know
as little as it is but yeah
yeah
yes
so that might be the focus of discussions next week or something right that um what need out of this and
have to
yep
to try and yes and home home in parameters and choose the right sort of settings
so yep
yeah so you might wanna try and come
yeah yeah
if you get that far
try and come equipped with a list of the kinds of things you want out of it and and so we can look through and see
um uh y ellen might have views on what kinds of things once we have a list right
so so yeah
yep
i'm sure she'll have views on it
so but it'd be good to you know
make sure once we have a list of the things that we think we're getting of it that it matches her intentions for what we were supposed to get out of it
mm-hmm
so um you know if we do talk about that then it might be nice to have her along for it
mm-hmm
um oh i found haven't fount it physically yet but uh a reference to uh a ninety two paper
it's in the royal proceedings of something or other somewhere based on a um an experiment that had blocks a model
blocks of parts and then an area where people had to build you know replicate the model out with the parts
oh yeah
uh just one person at a time of course
but uh it did involve um eye movements and monitoring where they're looking compared to their hand movements and uh that subject
oh yeah
who is that then
ballard
'kay
um are they still in the business
back in ninety two
yes i think so
where are they
uh the i'll mm not sure
okay
well they might have the folk wisdom on the complexity right
yep
so ninety two's not that long ago
yeah
so there should still be well not that on
well it is really
but
is it
y uh-huh
um is it a paper you can get
uh that's what i've m i'll have to try and find out
uh hmm
well they still do it for library loans and stuff so
if not um the national library is bound to have it
uh-huh yep
so do we think next week that's what we're gonna talk about
'cause we want wanna ask ellen ahead of time if she wants to come along for a discussion about oh well that's that's fine then
she's not here next week anyway
it's next wednesday or thursday before she's back
okay
oh yeah c she 'cause she her stuff is getting blocked off the mailing list 'cause she's not mailing from her normal account
oh is that what yeah she's got a mm yahoo account or something that things are getting forwarded to and
yeah
and i can't figure out any way to just approve messages from her without her subscribing at that account
ah
so
um
or or oh well
that's only if things haven't been getting through
ah
there's only one message so far
yeah
it didn't say much
uh
um anything else
yep
anything else
um i think that's it
and i'll t uh yeah
i'll get get working on the camtasia stuff this week and then so once uh once uh once we've got some some idea about what analysis you want out of this
i can think about whether g. d. f. 's got everything we need in it
um and f yeah what analysis we can pull out of it
well certainly
the the there's the provisional list of what we need on the wiki anyway that i put it up
yeah yeah
so i'll i'll double check the g. d. f. specification against that just to make sure it's got everything you said that you'd you say you need from that list
so
yeah
mm-hmm
bu i don't think that list is our final word on things and
um
um well i i added things to it
oh well maybe it is then
well better uh well i don't know when he last looked at it
but uh or when i added it
i
yeah
it was sometime in the last two weeks anyway
but uh
yeah
uh-huh
i don't think i was fully paying attention to that
i mean i'm not gonna have views on this anyway
what i'm really worried about is making sure that um there's not big surprises for ellen and and j. p. you know
mm-hmm
when they suddenly discover that they're they're assuming some analysis is in there and we didn't didn't put it in
that's what they're getting
yeah
you know
'cause now is the time for us to be figuring out what we want out of that data and and getting you write the stuff or getting j. p. to write the one dimensional analyses that he was talking about
mm-hmm
yeah
yeah
yeah
so
yeah
'cause they i mean we w we got all this in the ascii format at the moment and it's just a matter of what data do we need to pull out of that into the g. d. f. so i can actually do the proper analysis
mm-hmm
um 'cause i think all the answers are gonna be run off the g. d. f. format 'cause 'cause we've decided that if we went and looked well if we're looking at dynamic reasons and whatever else
yeah it
it's the it's the dynamic regions that uh i think might cause a bit of trouble
it has to be g. d. f.
but uh
yeah
which is yeah which is why we have to do it off the g. d. f. as as opposed to the e. d. f. format
so
oh right
okay
so y actually you're breaking this down into two steps now
one is just a straight extraction from the ascii and the other one is any post analysis that that adds information by analysing it
is that th
yeah yeah
so so the g. d. f. it's got yeah so it's it's got uh the all th the stuff on the um e. d. f.
so it's just the uh the ascii file the things like the mouse movements and things like that
yeah it's just anything that's got shoved through the eye tracker
and then yeah yeah and then on top of that g. d. f. can also it will also have information such as right
yeah
at this point in time they were looking at the new parts area or they were looking at the target
yeah yeah
okay that is post analysis
yeah
yeah
so right yeah
um so yeah
so the the g. d. f. is gonna have that sort of information in it
and then also 'cause it's x. m. l. file we can then do x. s. l. t. or whatever on to it to get extract whatever bits of data you need for yeah
for for whichever bits of analysis you're trying to do from it
that filter mm yeah filter out
mm-hmm
so
yeah
oh well that all sounds good
so
i've got o uh one thing to check and one person to ask if she'll volunteer to be a head
unless y
and as far as i know that's it for me
see i have to explain
yep i think so
i'm for for one of my other things i there is now a specific wiki page that says stuff jean has to do
to do
and i'm beginning to think that this is quite a good idea 'cause i worry about not doing the stuff people expect of me
hmm
much more than the other way around right
watch out well i think according to the latest documentation uh you're down for five percent of your fifteen months on this project or something
what documentation
some b uh jast report
oh okay
officially
well it doesn't actually make its way into its my salary i'm afraid
into reality uh-huh
so
right
but yeah
i mean i do spend time talking to you guys
so you're getting something out of me
mm-hmm
yeah
yep
but
i mean if you're ever you know late 'cause of that it's not we'll find a way around it
yeah it says
yeah
and i've put you guys on mondays at this time for my convenience but it's not like it's important that
yeah
well uh i was expecting to get yeah though and i did did make it in time
but it just just 'cause all the leaves and things
um the stra the trains weren't stopping at the stations
so they decided to put speed restrictions on
really
is it sliding past
i really
yep
yeah
great
'cause apar apar apparently p uh i'm not sure
i was th so what'd they have to do back up
um the and they're bussing people into station have particular problems on it 'cause it's on a 'cause it's on a hill or something
um so i had so i had to bus people in from like stations either side
ah
nasty
yes yes
but yeah at l at least it was speed restrictions instead of like trains flying past into barriers and things
so
yes
yeah yeah
go i we're glad they'll look after that bit
oh f yeah
okay
uh i don't know
do we wanna look at anything
it's not up yet
still fifty six percent completed
i can
skip it
'cause i'm just doing a b yeah disk check or something
oh i don't know what it's doing
oops that fell off
doesn't like silk
stay
and now we're gonna discover we've got no reason to meet right
yep
'cause everything's going swimmingly
is everything going smooth
well you know apa pa apart from apart all apart from waiting for the get get camtasia sorted out
oh
'cause uh i haven't been i haven't read the wikis in my email since i left
so um
yeah i haven't i haven't added anything to the wiki recently
so uh 'cause i've we've been been working on trying to get the x. m. l. stuff working
so some the ba basically they only had to how the dom works um so i can do the next so i can ge generate d. d. f. files
oh yeah
uh-huh
huh
um so so th yeah so just just been reading through documentation
that's what i was doing the end of last week um just so i know how it all works and figuring out the best way to do things
uh-huh
um but i'm at the moment i've i've been playing with the dom stuff in mozilla
uh 'cause i 'cause uh ju just so at least i can see how it works with the h. t. m. l. pages so i can generate um the x. so i can generate x. h. t. m. l. stuff and see how it all works there
just 'cause to just see how things work in that um and
um the oh well um i don't know the mozilla stuff
so if it turns out that it's idiosyncratic in some way that teaches you funny habits then it won't have been a good idea
it well thing is that the a. the a. well the a. p. i. is standardized by the w. three c.
so
so the a. p. i. is stan is standard between everything
yeah yeah
um
uh well y th there are certain companies um that i don't wanna name who don't always get it right
uh or
i c but m yeah mozilla
yeah it'll be alright
yeah yeah yeah
so okay
it is
it it just has a couple of yeah yeah
i believe you now it's a good strategy
um well yeah but if they will b but it doe does look like it does does that this is and things like that
so i was doing the is anyway
um it's ju it's just that that's that's quite a quick way to just to get into how how works
mm-hmm
because i can just quickly generate quickly generate a web page and then just add and take yeah
add things to and take things away and don't see exactly what's going on at the time
so
uh wh why does it help that it's x. t. h. t. m. l. instead of just x. m. l.
oh well just 'cause x. h. t. m. l. has a nice you know you got browsers there so you can actually see you can actually see directly what's what's going on
yeah but most m most browsers when when you uh put an x. m. l. file up in it
it'll just apply some default style sheet to it anyway that shows you
yeah well i'll i'm using x. h. t. m. l. uh to deter that's uh all all the web pages are x. h. t. m. l.
so it's x. m. l. just with the h. t. m. l. d. t. d.
okay yeah
yeah
ju ju ju just ba just 'cause we haven't uh we haven't f haven't quite finalised the um the g. d. f. format
so just just well just
okay so all you're gonna have to do is swap in tag names later
yeah yeah
so all have to do is just change it change that sort of thing so it's uh yeah
okay
ev everybody's got their different ways of doing these things
yeah
i'm sure that's fine
like having to uh g it's
hmm
mm
as long as it comes out in the end
that's
yeah
yeah yeah
no i'm just try i'm trying to l think of the things that could go wrong
mm
um but since i haven't tried it this particular way you know um but yeah that sounds good
yeah
yeah but
so um i so you say we haven't finalised what the g. d. f. looks like
is that an implicit request for me to do something
or
um that what what what what i'm doing the moment i'm looking through the s the uh stuff that robin put on the wiki to say what's
you know what what we need in the in the t um in the output format for the for the task you know
so what what you're what you're gonna do the analysis on
um so i'm making sure that i can take get that information out of the g. d. f. as it st state of the moment
and if i find something that you can't get out of it then i can add that to the add that to the g. d. f. format
uh-huh
yeah
so
as a well i mean there's two two cases in here right
there's things you can get straight off the original format and then there's things you have to do some kind of post processing of the original format
but it's not just a data format change it's actually some kind of computational process to get the thing out of it as well right
yeah yeah
and it wasn't uh y i think it was a little bit um confused uh last time we spoke about um whether
u whether you consider g. d. f. format to be um the thing that's just the straight forward translations of what's in the original eye tracking output
or whether like whether the post processing utilities are a separate step
'cause i think you and i had separate different views on this but i can't remember w who had which view at this point
yeah well the
so y are you working uh actively on this anal these analysis things or you just working on the translation
uh so the data format translation
well i'm i'm i'm ju try i'm making sure that the g. d. f. format we've got at the moment will d will output say well i've output old analysis that that robin's looking for
um so so i'm using that as a way to to get into ha ha using the dom things as well
um so yeah
so at the moment i'm looking at act actually the g. d. f. format itself um and then to generate the g. d. f. format i'm gonna be taking stuff out of the gest analyser um and then using a dom parser to generate uh x. m. l. output from the gest analyser
oh okay
so you haven't looked at what's in there and what isn't in there that you need to do some really intensive transform to do
uh no
not yet oh okay
no
but uh i'll when and out of the output of the gest analyser does does do some of the processing already
which is what i'll m plan to use that as the basis for it
'cause that already that already picks up like target regions things like that
yeah
so you get so so it knows whether you're looking at a part or whether you're looking at target area or what or whatever
uh-huh
um so yes as long as it got that in it somewhere
so it's just a matter of pulling that out and put that into the um into the g. d. f. stuff
okay
so this sounds like it's under control and you're happy and you guys are telling each other what you guys need to know
so i don't need to do anything right
uh nope don't think so
you're all fine
um
but there was a number of things that came before this right that it sounds like they're not under control yet
so so you know the g. d. f. stuff with so i ellen's view on this is we go through everything in order
like the priority is exactly the pipe line order right
yep
so um camtasia you mentioned
yeah um bu
and i'm not sure what else but we should check what other things were before this on the list of things to do
yeah yeah
i um i think the o the only thing i've got left to do before the experiments can be run is get s is get the check camtasia works
mm-hmm
um now i've got camtasia running on machines and i think they're set up correctly
but i can't test it until we get the microphones working
until you get the oh microphones
microphones
'cause
uh it's batteries we're waiting for
the they're they're due uh i i was told the beginning of this week
batteries
okay uh are they really really strange batteries
um th they are quite strange
mm uh uh it's w uh r um a avril has ordered them from somewhere possibly
have you tried maplin
are they expensive
n no
they're probably one fifty each or something like that
'cause you know like a wee bus journey over to maplin might solve the problem if it's getting in the way
uh well hopefully
the they should've been here last week
but uh caroline then phoned up to chase them and they they were s they were told to be here
should be today
so this isn't actually um ruining your schedule for anything and that's why you're waiting
uh r b well we can still test whether camtasia runs anyway
it's just the uh whether it's the microphones are picking up things correctly that we need to check
right okay
it is i so it sounds like you're not actually worried about the fact that this is the m yeah
not yet no
when you get worried go to maplin okay
right
phone them first to make sure that they're in there
somebody around must have a uh probably steve
somebody in the techie group will have a maplin catalogue
mm right o
fact i'll see if i can um yeah it's useful to know who's got a current one anyway
i don't seem to get them anymore
i guess i don't buy enough equipment
ah
well he must some these days anyway isn't it
so so
oh yeah
of course
duh
so you can find out whether they have it
virtual
but you'd have to phone over to find out if they have it in stock down there
yep
i actually live not that far from there
um so
it would be a half hour um diversion from my morning routine to pick up stuff
uh right
uh w but then again it's also very close to haymarket so it's even less of a diversion for you probably
but what we're
yeah
so we all got off easy
except you don't know your way around
yeah
ah well ca i can easy i can easy get to mapl uh to maplin i know where it is off i used to live there
ah yeah
so i know i know where i used to live here
oh yeah c yeah
i i
i'm a geek
i know where i know where maplin is
yeah
i just think well you know for the sake of three quid or however many quid it how many batteries does this thing take
mm-hmm
doesn't take a hundred
it no it's two batteries we need
yeah then you know put your mind at rest
'cause you know you wouldn't want it to be the morning you were supposed to be recording and then suddenly discover yeah
uh no no
yeah
no
you know this
yes
well i suppose i could gi i could give you a call on the way in tomorrow and if th not bi it's not been in your in your f um pigeon hole
i can easy go off the train and early and just pick 'em up from there
fair fair enough if you want
uh check they got 'em first though
their stocks are a bit funny down there
mm-hmm
right yeah
well i'll make sure i make a i'll make sure of i got the f the phone number in my phone so i can call them
'cause you know it's not that attractive an area to walk through if you're not gonna get anything out of it
all true
true
um uh it's dalry road isn't it
um
so of all the things that were on the wiki do i need to pull up the wiki
ah it is gonna let me log in
it's still probably even that angle
no i do not wanna change my password
um
but you guys probably know off the top of your head is there anything else that we we we were waiting on before you could run
can't remember the wiki
d um
so all those tasks craig had when it started
the only thing that well the thing that's holding s me slightly up is um checking whether joe's f finished that there i there is a working um model builder
but i'm not sure if it's the finished finished version yet
and the the ninth
uh his last day was the thirty first of october
yeah he still had n hours left
i wasn't sure uh if it was down to the number of hours or whether thirty first of october f uh certainly uh uh he right
uh yeah no no
it's ours
yeah it's ours
oh so he's got ours left
i think he's had something like seven
he's behind hand
but no he was billing for he was billing by the hour
so i thought well i mean obviously if he wants to finish off then you know
but uh n i've n ni nijmegen has gone dead for all those last two weeks
oh well they're probably away then
well uh it w e e ellen's away
wasn't ellen away
they're really at the same place
n no um but i think what they had was some big review
oh yeah it could be it
uh a and so i haven't heard anything back from them
so uh the models for
oh you have no models at all
oh that's a pity
model buil builder that's what i was calling the graphical model editor right
yes uh-huh
so you use x. fig to make the parts and then you this thing
well no
well we don't need to um make the the parts are all the standard tangram ones i had before anyway
the x. fig thing's only when we come to building airplanes and new peculiar shapes
oh okay
uh but for this experiment it's just the tangram type uh task
yep
okay
um i have something in my email about from joe
yep
uh he wouldn't have sent it just to me would he
do you want me to check that
um yeah if you got right
i'm not gonna project my email
how r f how recently that nothing i haven't i heard anything from joe for a a week or so anyway
i t i'd say you don't be
so
okay i think i mighta heard thursday or something
i can't remember exactly when it was
yeah
that's that's newer than the
uh
mm
it's the last thing was in sp response to the thing i was saying last week about the parallelogram being the wrong way around and uh w from the model builder to the actual yeah
yeah yeah
screen shots
yeah yeah
um that nothing has i haven't heard anything since from either sort of the netherlands or from you
okay so i've got something on the twenty eighth
oh
hmm
that's friday i think
oh he just wants to know how to get paid
yep
right
that suggests he's done done done
anyway he's in edinburgh
so well i suppose he won't come by 'cause craig's on his desk
oh is he back
oh is he
yeah
oh no right okay
so
well i'm i'm using dice machines
if he wants to pop in for five minutes the the windows machine is free for him at the moment
well he's just not gonna try to le squat there that's all
uh well i so the last thing i've got from him about work work was the nineteenth of october that said he uploaded some changes that you wanted
that's
oh so you didn't get that
it was me and him
but presumably the he put it on the wiki
so
so he's just telling us 'cause he things we probably don't read wikis
and i'll just check
yeah it was after it was after that that uh there was the thing about um w w why the parallelogram was the was a mirror image
yeah
yeah i mean i considering we get an email from uh the i think it got sent through saying that he'd updated the the whatever it was on the wiki
so you do he'd he'd uploaded a ne a new zip file and overwritten the old one
mm-hmm
yeah
so
well i i haven't replied to him about yeah i really don't have anything more more recent from him
s i haven't replied to him about um
you know how to submit costs and stuff like that
so um but that suggests he's at at the end of things but w we could just ask him
i mean maybe you guys would just wanna ask him directly you're done done right
'cause um it's worth you guys knowing
and then of course any problems that remain you inherit
uh right you know it's worth taking a look at what it does and making sure it does what you want i guess
yep
so th the problem is you want you wanted to construct some models in it for your experiment but you were hoping to get some from marloes
yes
yes or at l least um she was meant to have have some idea of the level of complexity
'cause they d they d have actually run things and to uh get an idea of the sort of style and to check that they'd be alright
ah yeah yeah
but all very quiet
right have you you tried cold calling her
that's what i do when i need things that
yeah
uh no it has just been email rather than uh f f the telephone type of uh request
ach try phone
but
when i if you get 'em today when are you gonna start running
i'm down for a week
what's the seventh is a w a week today i think
oh right
next week
so you have to be you have to be ready by then
um well uh i haven't booked anybody in or anything
yeah or re change the schedule
but uh that's when i'm hoping
right okay
we have been of course put back a bit by the eye tracker going down
uh-huh yeah
makes sense
um subjects you're gonna have d
yep
but uh we're we're needing we're certainly needing some data in the bag by the first of december i think
yeah
so s y y you don't have subjects lined up but you don't expect any trouble getting them
no
um hopefully not
mm-hmm
the only other slight complication is um which will be b i think brought up at the meeting on thursday for all the eye tracking users
yeah
um uh the lab has been block booked again
by
jules from um psychology
um i don't know this person
so they well they need to be serious about it
have di
who who's their is that a staff member or a student
yep
okay
um well we kinda paid for the lab
so it depends but i suppose talking to them sometimes solves these problems
um you might it depends on what sort of staff member is it
is it a
lecturer
right
um i mean presumably he or she is not running subjects the entire
well presumably not
but uh it's sort of quite solidly booked uh for f certainly w what six days from ten till five for two or three of those days
block book for how long
uh-huh
uh-huh
um so uh um ellen's still out of town right
it's just uh y you could try calling this person and see how this works
ellen might be more persuasive
um it's just sometimes uh academic staff have a bit of a chip about um research staff
and since i don't know the person i can't tell whether it's one of those or not
um i wouldn't i no i can probably at least email her and ask her uh if she's really needing it all that time
mm-hmm
yeah and then escalate i guess
but uh you know or whether they can be put off for a little bit or something
so i have no idea how the booking system works
well you're discussing it on thursday right
i i well yeah at the m yep
at the moment there's just a booking system
yeah
when people just uh if they can log on to it can book it
yep
well that's that's one to raise at the meeting
mm-hmm
um i v might talk to ellen about that ahead of time 'cause uh they may have she and martin may have had discussions about appropriate use of the lab
uh i th in theory jast is meant to have it every morning
oh really
yeah but i g don't you guys set up for isn't block booking more appropriate
because
i i isn't there set up involved in changing around for somebody else
um but it uh there shouldn't be any changes in the physical connections or or anything
no
or in the software or anything
no
okay
so there's no cost associated with it being mornings or afternoons
uh no
that as long as p other people don't for some reason i don't know disconnect some bits of the equipment there's no reason why they should
yeah
it's just the
s so in the worst case um you may be able to make an argument if you actually need that week that you can collect in the mornings that week
is this something that's known outside ellen's head
uh yes it's um it's on the p uh it's not on the booking system
it's on the w booking system
it's on a web page that frank created about the lab
oh well
that's something
which i don't know if anybody actually knows is there
uh-huh
well most the time to to p yeah
yeah
mm-hmm
so it sounds like you've got a lot of possible ways of getting what time you need
of course try to be kind to other people
but you would anyway
yep
so
so those are the only things that are worrying you camtasia and lab access
and otherwise no sweat you're happy
should should be
i've also got to get camtasia we well yes the m the model builder
oh and the model builders yeah
i've got to get camtasia working um as a sort of little multi media thing to generate a video of how to mi sort of a an instructional video
oh yeah
h uh-huh
yeah
these this is gonna take a little while
it's what i'll have to do this week
mm-hmm
yeah
well when the whole thing was if it was gonna run a trial that'll give you some some screen shots to work with
and then it'll just be a matter of adding new video f mouse movements or whatever
hmm
so
yeah but you were gonna try and figure out how to overlay something on top of the video that or no
u
you were just g really gonna run a video of the sep of the trial
yep yeah
yeah okay
that's that's much easier
so um with the model builder what do you need to do with it
th the um which one you is gonna look at what it does so far and you'll just t try out do that
uh i'll i'll do that
yeah and just yeah
yeah
uh have a look
if you th anything prob any problems with it um think there's a wiki page up for that f for that piece of uh for yeah for that thing
mm-hmm
mm
so if if you just put just put whatever recommendations bugs on that page and i'll work through them read 'em as and when i can
have a look at uh um hopef hopefully there's not a p a problem
yeah
but uh they said marloes was uh also meant to be checking it and doing things and quiet
yeah
uh-huh
yeah yeah
um how many models were you relying on her for
um
um i've i uh it hasn't been divided up in that sort of way
so are you suddenly gonna be
well what i'm trying to get at is is your start time gonna be delayed 'cause you don't have the models ready if she doesn't come through
but
um depends how quickly i manage to get a grip of it how long it takes me to generate them or how i get on with the camtasia
uh-huh
yeah
well
mm-hmm
yeah
un unsure of yet
um can you draft craig in to build some if necessary
and like these yeah i mean i've used the software and there's not that hard i mean
it it shouldn't the there shouldn't be any great uh problems
uh
just checking that the they're of a suitable level of complexity or or of whatever
yeah
yeah
well you know me contingency planning and all this
i always worry about the worst
yeah
yeah
no quite quite right
if
yeah
so yeah
yeah
so well i can't imagine the building the building the mold is gonna be that hard
i mean i can easily just well however many thousands are on that uh dutch web site you found
just you know pick pick some of them redo them in in the ja in the j. c. d. format
that's yeah
it's pretty mechanical
i can easily d easily do that
so but it's a matter of choosing which ones you need to do
um yeah
which i guess you have to do
well i was hoping for some feedback from yeah
well yeah
yeah well you need to you you and marloes need to sort out yeah
yeah exactly
you can um call a jast telcon between you and marloes
you know i if it's not that see you know
with the cold calling you can usually at least find out whether they're alive and get an an offer to to get something
yes
but you know the next the next escalation is saying no we really need to talk about this
we're gonna talk about it you know tuesday at such such a time unless you
yep mm book a time and i think so
um
right
well i'll try and get ahold of her again today and see what
but presumably whatever it is they've been going through is now over
i think it it was up till the end of october
so presumably today they're now free again
mm-hmm
yeah
or taking a week off to recover
i d
yes
i'd just hate for that to c um to slow you up in collecting stuff that's all
um well hopefully it it won't anyway
it's just if i then do it i hopefully will get the right models
obvious yeah uh okay that's true
that's that's the pro so uh uh it will be generated
well that sounds
it's whether the models are optimal or not that i think that's right
that's quite a small thing she can do for you i guess
you know
it's not like you know w sitting there brain deadly constructing you know some models that she needs to do
mm-hmm
it's just to provide advice about this which must take take less time
yep
well that all sounds fine
you guys worried about it
you worried about anything
we've mostly been talking about the experiment schedule
so
um i don't think don't think so
i mean uh so the the major thing i've gotta d got to do is get this camtasia sorted out
so just waiting for the batteries for that
mm
um if robin's not worried i'm not worried
mm-hmm
um
you're gonna run out of things to um f do that we haven't set you up for any time soon
um p
the g. d. f. sounds like it might take a wee while
yeah yeah 'cause i'll go gotta finalise that format and then once that's done i've gotta start looking at the analysis side of it
mm-hmm
well so it was the whole all the dynamic region part of it that's uh
and that's
yeah
um
yeah but you don't need anything from me for that 'cause that's already sorta speced
i mean again that's the pair of you
yeah yeah
i think yeah
no the the analysis i think the analysis will take a little while
i don't think it's gonna take that long to get its stuff sorted out
it's gonna be how to display it and all that sort of stuff
uh whatever makes it easiest for you to do
mm-hmm
yeah
um but once w
it's just what i'm worrying it w worried about is him being in the lab all day long and you not being sure like what to do for the analysis on or something
'cause you're gonna be completely unavailable when you're recording
or will there be times when you don't record all day
uh n um no
uh well it depends how how many i can book in and get get running
uh-huh
yeah
and before my brain melts it but w when when the experiment's running yeah it's i'll be in the lab
yeah
uh i can't just go in let them get start and then come back
'cause he might oh yeah no no no i understand that
hmm
it's uh so some people can but
it was it was more like oh it was more like you know
you so this week he's got you know the g. d. f. stuff to do
then next week you're planning on recording
and what happens if suddenly you're unavailable all of next week just when he runs out of work
uh th they'll certainly be time because i'm right next to the lab anyway i'll come back just to check my email and things anyway so uh yeah
yeah
so so we'll worry about it then
yeah yeah
um yeah so i still gotta work on the gest analyzer and turn that into the t into a g. d. f. outputter
um and uh oh yeah and i'll i can have a look at the model builder as well
mm-hmm yeah
um 'cause one thing i'm thinking about is w we're looking at the the part building pa type stuff
yeah
uh and it might worth seeing if we can add a little part builder thing into the um model builder
um just just the ju i just gotta tidy tidy up some the code for generating the parts anyway the j. c. t. um parts from from s. v. g. s
what i do don't know is we wanna bother with a part builder
i mean the idea was it wasn't worth the investment right
yeah
yeah yeah
mm-hmm
but i'll wanna have a qui have a quick look and see see how easy it is to add this things to it
'cause um if if i can use it to generate um um the rotsym angle for example and the rotation symmetry stuff for it
yeah yeah yeah
which is what was causing the bugs uh before
or do y
mm-hmm
um so if i if i can use the model builder to automatically do that then that would sa that would save quite a bit of work and it'll d save a few bugs
m yeah but now now that the guy building these models know that they need to do the rotsym some stuff
so
do they have do you have trouble doing it
no
no so
no
it's uh it's just something you gotta remember once the part's been built
mm-hmm
so um
yeah
well g i mean um we might want to um severely cash limit the investment that you put into making a part builder right
yeah yeah
well i'm not not not pl not planning do much on that
so how how many person days would it be worth like if craig discovered it could be done in x. days
mm-hmm
it's just
uh i wouldn't bother more than one or two certainly
right so there's your limit
don't spend more than a day or two on it
yeah
yeah uh 'cause it really isn't worth it
i mean i've i've already i've already got this yeah
you you have to understand there's things about this project we've hidden from you so far that you'll have to learn about
yeah other i saw saw saw saw something about map task like little further down my task list
so it's it's not like you're out of work
oh really
oh that one'll just be a little add on
that'll whatever it is it'll be the same skills as you've learned for something else
right
um and it'll just be i'm not even sure that's you 'cause i think somebody else is doing that actually
but um i'm thinking more of the fact that um at some point we should probably tell you about this n. x. t. stuff
mm-hmm
right
so
yeah well that that's that's just x. m. l. to x. m. l. to x. m. l. isn't it
w
turning g. d. f. and what other bits into n. x. t.
oh yeah yeah yeah
but you know there's x. m. l. and x. m. l. and you know
yeah yeah
it takes stand off links and stuff and it's um some some people if they're not used to linguistic annotation c um uh it c take a little time to get their head around the way the do data data model works
right right
and um you know there's stuff to learn there
um yeah 'cause that's the yeah o other than you have from what i've heard about it is both x. m. l.
so
so the the programming side of it doesn't sound too hard
it's gonna be making sure that it fits what you expect out of the format
yeah yeah
so um but no that's that's fine
yep
so
i'll d i'll have try to find i'll i'll have plen plenty of uh plenty of questions for you once i once i get to the last stage
i'm sure
yeah
so just don't witter away you know weeks on fripperies when we've got the real me meat of this yet to come
mm-hmm
yeah
we'll find we'll find plenty of really really crucial s things for you to do
yeah
i don't think you'll be twiddling your thumbs no
so
yeah we'll
yeah
well the we're gonna get camtasia sorted out this week and then it's concentrate on the on the gest analyzer the g. d. f. stuff
um and then yeah
once once we've done that it's whatever whatever you whate whatever you whatever you want me do once i done the once i've done the g. d. f. i guess
okay
so uh i'll uh remind myself to look at what's next before the next time we get together
yep
yeah so i think the g. d. f. will keep me busy for a little while yet
so um yeah well that's yeah
certainly keep me busy until this time next week when we can start suggesting things that might might need to look at for the next stage i guess
yeah
so you collect on monday
that means you don't wanna meet right
um well at twelve o'clock next monday the lab is technically booked by jules
oh r right it's actually next week
it's actually the week that you were planning on
it
uh it starts the uh on we this wednesday and goes through to next wednesday
oh okay
well i don't know
anyway um you'll tell me whether it we cancel this
mm-hmm
or whether i just talk to craig
in which case we won't be up here 'cause we don't record twos
yep
okay
um what else
uh yeah
my then other complication is two weeks tomorrow i start my teaching
oh yeah
that should be fun
mm-hmm
let's see that's like the
for i've got two weeks of that fo four lectures and four labs
yeah
that comes at an ideal time for you then
yes
that's like the twentieth or something
uh i can't add
uh what's tomorrow is the f tomorrow the f first
monday is the
for the first yeah
so it will be the fifteenth for two weeks
yeah
yeah
hmm
actually yeah that reminds me i wo wo i wo i won't be uh on thursday i'm gonna be over in my induction day
oh you've got your uh induction that's right
so so
oh yeah you have to promise to tell us how that is
'cause people do ask me
fair enough fair enough
i mean uh i don't it's meant to be that in depth
uh yes
from a total waste of time to you know
it's
yeah on a scale of one to seven
yes yes
i mean i d i don't expect to be that in depth
i mean it's fifteen minutes on a variety of different topics
so it's just it's uh it is
yeah
uh yes it is
i'm sure most of it i already know
it's like fire safety
yeah
health safety data protection
usual sort of stuff you get everywhere
mm-hmm
so
it's probably the university'll cover itself legally i think by doing this
yeah you'd be surpri these things do
uh mm-hmm
yeah
well if they were gonna do that then they'd force you to go to it
yeah
uh no i suppose rather than being nobody's bothered so far is it
i would and i would know somebody who'd gone to know
you know
i'm pretty sure they didn't have induction in my day
yeah
so
uh well i don't remember being asked for an induction
so
really
but you only started here
in april
mm
they were supposed to i'm sure
yeah i mean i can remo
i got invited to a um a a a summer garden party for new staff members
but that was but that's all
oh well
yeah i can remember when i start being a st when i was sta starting being a student
i mean ha we had the inductions were compulsory because um a lot of students were doing te were doing teaching
and you couldn't do the teaching unless you done the induction because you had to know about health and safety and fire safety before you could take a charge of yeah
hmm
oh yeah
'cause you were the responsible person in the in the class room
uh
so
so but uh yeah i'm not sure i'm not sure why the why why i'm doing it now
yep
but okay
uh uh
so see how it go
i'll i'll uh give you my report on friday or something
mm-hmm
i have one n. x. t. question which hopefully won't be well it's not one
okay
just hopefully as part of the output it will be something like that
is that correct
so you've got the gaze position of the first person gaze position of the second mouse position of the first
mouse position of the second and i don't know a common mouse action there or something
yeah
does that t just in in sort of layers like that
seems reasonable
so um it'll be like in uh monitor
but yeah they'll all be different tiers like that
yeah
yep
and then there's the language stuff as well presumably
yes uh-huh
m that's that's just the the eye movement uh other sort of stuff yeah
yeah this is the easy stuff
yeah
well eyes and mouse
eyes and mice
uh-huh
and that's enough for you right
i mean that's just the way you want it
it ho hopefu uh hopefully that's yeah i guess it's that's why i dre
course there are lot lots of things that can do that
but it's the language part that's the hard part
as well
yeah mm-hmm
yeah
yeah
so i was just yeah
i was just checking that uh i know the language part because they say l. p. here but uh this would be the the the new part
yeah that's
new stuff
that seems fine yeah
yeah
do you know what the um the sets of codes are
well the whatev whatever whatever you're getting out of the jast analyser
so
uh yeah whatever that is
i mean blinks as well right
um yes i'm not sure whether we need to know exactly where they are just how many there are in each tra um uh p i don't know
oh so you don't want a pa uh part of this data
i suppose it could go in
aye
but
uh i mean i suppose it we're as well to have it if we can
i think you i think you should well there's two views on this
um if you do then the people formulating research questions will ask about them
right
but if you don't they'll probably ask about them anyway and then you'll have to add 'em after the fact
uh so it's probably easier just to s shove 'em in
well uh just say stick 'em in anyway
you can stick 'em in a different um track and uh and then load 'em or not load 'em as you please
yeah
mm-hmm
'cause it's not well i don't know
with is it is it part of so th these are mutually exclusive and exhaustive sets of codes against time right
mm-hmm
isn't blink a part of this
um blink would uh uh at the moment just get lumped in with the sort of previous gaze
yeah
but but isn't that important
mm-hmm
because when they're blinking basically it's like an a nil code
you c can't find out what they're doing otherwise
the way they're looking mm-hmm
so it may actually be important to have the blinks registered in there because you may discover you need to take them into account to smooth some kind of analysis that you're doing
mm-hmm
so it could be that if they only they hadn't had a blink just then they would've been i don't know what
m uh yes mm-hmm
moving somewhere else or is more likely to be uh
i'm thinking more
blinking at the same time as the other person was doing something i think to mm-hmm
that you wanna know about
yeah
oh i hope n not to much relies on missing stuff 'cause people blink
i was thinking more like um you know
the person looks a p a part and they've got a uh fixation before and after and there's blink in the middle
and you know there may be times when you wanna treat that as one thing right
yes
norman normally uh would be just as i say like add the blink time and duration to the previous fixation
oh right
okay
so but in that case
'cause you're not absorbing any new information and that's what the critical sort of deciding factor is
right uh-huh
in that case then um these tiers are already like blink corrected
yes so that they'll include the
and then you wouldn't have blinks as part of this
you'd want blinks as a separate tier if you're gonna have it in
so i i yeah would ha it would be as a separate tier where just to mark
yeah
the actual position
yeah so the key thing is he here is mutually exclusive and exhaustive
mm-hmm
and um the second key thing is um it better be really clear to the people who are dealing with these codes um uh w yeah
what's included and what's n yeah
whether any monkey business has been done around the blinks to correct for that
mm-hmm
um 'cause you know it wouldn't necessarily be obvious looking at that set of codes that
hmm
no not certainly l not looking at codes no
uh yeah i suppose if you know about eye trackers then you'll just know
mm-hmm
but
huh
okay
know what to look for and what not to yeah
so so that mean you need the blink corrections part of the analysis then
um
it i think you're just saying it comes out of the eye tracker already right
they're already blink corrected
uh i there are well they're already identified as blinks
then it's uh i it is at th hmm at what stage
the software that i've used uh p pools uh the blinks so will add it on
i'm not sure what the default
right
so tha tha that's uh that's for the rest of the stuff that comes the eye tracker isn't the analyzer software that comes the eye tracker
yes
yeah so i'm not su i certainly it's listed as a separate event in the stream
blinks are a tag uh from the e. d. f. and and that sort of thing
right
it's registered as a a detection
right okay
well i i if if you want if you want the blinks mer merged into a fixation
but
it might worth making making a cr part of the requirement for the g. d. f. stuff
mm
so to remind me so to to just add that analysis to yeah to to it
mm-hmm
so it's i mean it's easy enough to do just che just checking the times th times of the events
yeah
uh i y yeah
uh i mean it it it won't because of the fixation it will be down to what we define as uh a gaze
so basically the time from when somebody starts looking at an object until they leave it
and so if they blinked a lot within that they're still looking at that object
so it's just the time in to the time out
right
yeah
okay okay
but what we need to know is like at what stage in the eye tracking stuff where it does that and whether that gets through so that um craig gets it automatically in what he's translating or to g. d. f.
mm-hmm
yep
whether he needs to redo the same analysis because something about the data path cuts off that analysis for the eye tracker
mm-hmm
or whether we even like it right and wanna do it some different way
hmm
some other way
yeah
yeah 'cause i think the ascii format as it stands does contain blink information um 'cause uh d d i'm sure i'm sure that's appeared in the in the documentation i've read through
yes
mm-hmm
yep there's a blink sort of event
yeah
but it could be these things are corrected for blinks in this way plus there's blink information
so you know it it treats it as a fixation around blinks and it also just happens to tell you where the blinks are
possibly
possibly yeah
'cause as they were saying they like to use blink rate as measures of cognitive difficulty or something
mm-hmm
so
right
okay okay
um yeah
so might might worth us us having a look at that and just just seeing what dat is what data is already in the ascii format and whether you want me to do any correction as part of the analysis
yep
um 'cause i've gotta do the analysis for the fixations on parts and things anyway
so yeah i d i i i didn't think check for blinks during that
isn't gonna be a shouldn't be a big problem
it should just be a matter of treating a b adding on the blink to the last fixation or something anyway
yeah
yep
um so we'll be
if they're not still fixating on it when they come back out of the blink then
why is that is that the right thing to do analytically
uh well uh the the real reason is um as long as they've been blinking
even if they then open their eyes somewhere else that's when they start absorbing the new information
oh right
yeah you said that
it's basically like a just a long saccade
mm it you kind of have visual suppression when you move and it's the same when you're blinking
you're not taking anything in
so
well but does um the duration of fixations count for anything
'cause it if you're just adding the length of the blink to the fixation you're not treating it as a saccade
uh it it's yeah that yes um that's for the sort of gaze time measure
uh it's not actually the fixations are still um independent
so the they w fixation duration isn't doesn't include the blink in the ascii a output
okay
it's only when we start looking at sort of the total gaze that um the total amount of time spent looking at one particular object
wait
which includes all these sort of multiple fixations and any blinks and that sort of thing
okay
is it it's a a sort of composite uh viewing time
i kinda get this
yeah yeah
mm-hmm
right mm-hmm
so more complicated than i thought
uh yeah i'm afraid uh mm-hmm
i'd forgotten about the multiple fixations on an object
yeah
okay
and so are you looking for a final thing that just sort says between this time and this time you're looking at this object
between this time this time you're not looking anything
yep yep
and
although we'll also still need a count of the fixations just so we can have you you've got measure fixation duration again just to s see if those they spend longer just f amount of more stable move uh eye fixation or not
yeah yeah
uh
'cause i think i think at the moment the g. d. f. format has fixations in it
mm-hmm
um so so i gue i guess that'd be part of the g. d. f. to transformation would be turning fixations into gazes and whatever else
yep
to ye yeah mm-hmm
okay okay
viewing times
well tha tha don't don't uh worry about that just the moment
well it's not okay i mean this is kinda what we were talking about before this confusion about what's in the g. d. f.
but
i mean you might see it as the initial g. d. f. is just whatever straight forwardly translates without
you know without transforms with just the data format changing from the ascii
and then there's a bunch of other things that get added that you might still want to be in um augmented g. d. f. format
mm-hmm
you know like this blink and the gaze and whatever else
and then you translate to n. x. t.
so you might still wanna have everything in this one g. d. f. file format that represents everything
and then the n. x. t. thing is just a splitter
it's not doing any fancy analysis
right yeah
so i see this as you know
a bunch of little routines that take the the g. d. f. without this information in it and add new information into th sub script versions of the g. d. f. file that contains these post process analyses
mm-hmm
well that's partly why i brought this up now is it i'm not sure what point down the data path things sort of happen
but that's what i want out in the end
right
yeah
right
so so so w will you actually be doing much of the g. d. f.
or is are you expecting do most the analysis on out of the n. x. t. stuff then
so whe when you uh when you actually generate your results
mm-hmm
um well the n. x. t. stuff will have the more complete picture 'cause it will include combine all the linguistic stuff with all the movements and the actions
yeah
right
um but there'll be i suppose just some purely eye movement stuff we could do
i s presumably with g. d. f.
uh
yeah
uh yeah
c well yeah
you told that earlier 'cause you could do a quick ana you could do a quick analysis on the g. d. f. stuff without having to before you hit before you do the dialogue analysis type stuff
mm-hmm
so you can get some some results anyway can't you
mm-hmm
yeah
i mean it to some extent it doesn't matter which data format it's in n. x. t. or g. d. f.
okay
yeah
but it makes more sense for the converter between g. d. f. and n. x. t. not to add any data
all it does is do this this stupid data format conversion
mm-hmm
and it it's just you know separating it out in the little steps
so you know there have to be these other scripts that add any um data transforms um not data format transform forms but data transforms
like this idea of um of putting together gazes from fixations
so y you know i if we keep it simpler like that so that it's in little pieces
then it'll be just easier to understand w what the wh the whole thing does
hmm
right
okay okay
hmm
c
'cause you you c you know i if suddenly you discover there's a problem with the g. d. f. to n. x. t. transform
you wanna know whether it's one of these little post processes going wrong or whether it's just the thing that dumps it into the multiple files for the and g. d. f. to n. x. t. transform is c is pretty simple
an
so um you know
right
and uh yeah
that's also why i sent you the mm saarbruecken software f that uh the stuff that takes the ascii sort of format originally and then just uh sort of compresses it and things
oh yeah yeah
the germans don't yeah yeah yeah
yeah the german stuff
uh because that little utility um does things like t well but you can tell it to what to do with blinks
whether just to lump them in or or not
oh yeah
uh what the minimum fixation duration for a stable fixation would be sort of you have if it picks up t fixations less than say fifty milliseconds
you can tell it just to again lump them all together that's not a sort of reliable enough fixation
fair enough fair en
uh you can put in these sort of of things
so that's uh that's a bit of software that's sent and that includes the source code and things as well
yeah so so they they we're allowed to do whatever without without source code
there's no c sort of restrictions on that
fair enough fair enough
mm-hmm
so that's like all the analysis that you need to do to things
are you just gonna copy what they do
or is it documented like why they did it they way they did it
or is it just
uh no there's very little documentation as you might imagine for these sort of things
well it's good starting point right
yeah so i g i uh yeah
so it'd be interesting to see if you agree with the decisions that they made about how to do things
that's that's why
so mm-hmm
mm-hmm
yeah i suppose i can easy look through and start writing up some documentation on it
hmm
that'll gi that'll give us a starting point for us to sort to talk about it to look for what analysis we n actually need to do on it and things
mm-hmm
um yeah easy
c yeah create all the uh switches and whatever else you need to do
so um
mm
fine
good
okay
okay
yeah
so we'll on once yeah
well once i've had once i've had a bit of bit more look at this g. d. f. stuff then start looking through that
start looking through that and make sure that works
mm-hmm
'cause uh al also just filters it
'cause
there are a lot of um strange event tags that the eye link produces that are fairly meaningless i think
and it can stri it strips out a lot of the junk uh as well
yeah
yeah yeah
ah
i've l yeah i've no no noticed that the the the gest analyser knows quite a few things as well
so it cleans it up
mm-hmm
uh-huh
so um but as
well b but we don't wanna build it into our data path
we just wanna learn from it i think right
right
correct
uh b fine
or no
well um possibly
yeah
well uh i use it that useful for generating this g. d. f. stuff
i can easily incorporate whatever functions it takes from into gest analyser when i'm do doing the g. d. f. stuff
yeah
so
i'm just thinking you know like i so this takes the ascii to to a d simplified ascii
yep
and simplified in with transforms in it ascii and it's just it seems to be harder to maintain something that's got that in it if it'd be better to break things up into like steps
mm-hmm
yeah
that you know as part of the the and als well why do i think this
the pr
i don't know because it's somebody else's programme and then they're gonna give us the next version and that's gonna break our entire pipeline
uh yeah
uh-huh
yeah i see what you mean uh-huh
you know
that's the main reason
yeah yeah
i mean but what yeah say what what i'll what i'll plan to do with it then is take the is take to the software
find out what functions are useful for us in that
and then use those functions to generate the stuff that goes into the x. m. l. file the the g. f. format
yeah
mm-hmm
uh yeah i can imagine i can imagine that also requiring some discussion about whether what they do is what we actually wanna do
six or
that should be interesting
yeah yeah
uh
so so the fir fir first part that'll be documenting what they've got and then discussing it with robin
mm-hmm
uh-huh
so uh yeah
well sounds good
so so i suppose pose that that way the
it's it's not quite s it so it's not gonna be quite grabbable 'cause it is it's written in java
right
but yeah well i tr mo mostly yeah
i'm sure i sure most the logic's gonna be gonna be the same
yeah well yes uh-huh the actual uh
so um
yeah
and if in doubt um don't filter stuff out keep it in right
'cause we always dump it to this other n. x. t. track that we don't need to load necessarily
mm-hmm
so um the idea is you just keep stuff unless
right
yeah fair enough
yeah
it's always better than making too much compression to start with and then being out of unable to go back or yeah
yeah fair enough
mm-hmm
well so so it's so long as it's x. m. l. n. x. t. will handle it won't it
lossiness
'cause
oh yeah and it's easy enough to dump stuff into an into separate track
yep
w we gotta teach you about this at some point though
so um but still not quite sure when
fair enough
it sounds like maybe in another week
okay okay
so jonathan made me promise not to um tell you about it when you first arrived 'cause you were gonna get overload about learning eye trackers and no
or or you leave very quickly
it's just too many things at once and it wasn't important that it be then
uh-huh
yeah
well i'm well i'm well g i've got the hang of all the stuff i've been going through
and it looks like l looks like i'm coming to end of the stuff the stuff list there already
yeah
so
so i'm gonna have start looking at that as the next stage
yeah
he's a cool customer
he's ready for it
so
okay
i think we're done right
yep
yep
well i'm i am
oh dear
uh my page is blank still
sorry
oh yeah i don't know
i do not really need to this just says look at the wiki
find out what's next
you could give give craig more work to do
well i ma i ma i may be maybe i want to check out these batteries and things won't i
this one's mine
it
i guess not
so tomorrow
oh yeah well that'll take forever
well that'll be something to do
well well will the will the will will do if the trains are tha as bad as today
that's that's really fun
check your batteries
so
which data
you know i i want everything and then i'll decide what i want
yeah
so this was that face to face meeting
okay
um but it uh it doesn't
there isn't th so there are things in the eye tracker record that we definitely don't want in the g. d. f. format um like the frame rate eye movement
you know we we uh uh i we're if we're expecting the g. d. f. format to be um sort of a parsed version of events
and you know there's just too much raw frame f frame rate stuff coming out of this
you wouldn't prob you wouldn't want it in this kind of format for up translation to the other things
we can get back to it
we can get we can always get back to it
yeah we yeah you can get back to it
we're not th actually throwing anything away
yeah
we're not throwing anything away
and if we decide to re jig this at some finer
this is just the stuff
yeah
mecha method
we'll still have the original and a method of uh of filtering
yeah
but the th but the way to think of this is this is the data that we want to be able to analyse against the other tracks of data
so
mm-hmm
mm-hmm
so the data that we wanna compare with a language or with whatever
mm-hmm
mm-hmm
and um so
okay
as long as the format in which we pick it up is a format which could be generalised to a finer take
because the worst thing that can ever happen to you is you discover that you've done huge amounts of analysis and th you actually had the data but you threw it away because you treated it so grossly
yeah
okay
so whatever we should be able to b you know backtrack and say okay instead of every second every tenth of a second or some such thing
s so in essence what you would then do is
but you know th
well we're not doing frame rate at any frame for well maybe we are
i don't know
well the eye tracker does
i i had thought we were yeah the eye tracker does
yeah
uh five hundred hertz though
but
mm-hmm
yeah
but right
w what w um the kinds of events that we had r uh before talked about putting into the record for then use in elan and n. x. t. isn't based on saying every x. seconds something
you know give me give me what's happening every x. seconds
well you need
it's more like you know give me the fixations and the um the blinks
well one needs to know the duration of these things right
yeah
oh yeah
so one needs to be able to say
durations are in there
but it's not there's a difference between um saying that something is in a particular state every frame
mm-hmm
whatever the frame rate is you know ten seconds a minute
you know that's that's one kind of w way of looking at data
mm-hmm
and um a parsed version of the data which isn't at um any particular length
it relies on this really close frame rate that's underneath
well so there's no real time there's only ev there's only events
what i'm we're trying to figure out is whether we've thrown time away
no no
the time the time is still in there
but you'll get uh what you want is to figure out what are the um the concepts behind that data that you want represented
so rather than saying the eye was at this particular place
you know here and then a tenth of a second later here and then a tenth of a second later here
here
you say there was a fixation from this time to that time and there was blink from this time to that time
okay
and
so one of the formats in which eye tracker data is analysed is percentage of time spent on some target as opposed to some competitor over the first second after some event
okay
so you actually have to be shu have to show at some time slice rate whether the eye was on the same target as the other guy
okay
a similar target what we'd both been deali you know
so we have to b we have all the parts the interesting parts of the screen identified and be able to show distribution of gaze over time
mm-hmm
mm-hmm
alright
now we could be really unlucky and somebody would expect us to do that at the real frame rate
yeah
but i think that's really unlucky
but but my point is that we mustn't throw away in or lose the capacity of being able to deliver that kind of data
right
so there's two issues here
we're not throwing anything away
mm-hmm
mm
but the question is what tool would you use to get that information out of the data
would you be so the more you can plan
s so typically the eye will move right
mm-hmm
so over any one second they eye's actually f fixing on a bunch of different things
and you and so when you say the eye was on this from here to here what's gonna happen is that is that if you use the real frame rate
it's gonna jiggle all over the place
it's gonna be on this landmark
yeah
uh it's on this object that object this fixed thing that fixed thing okay
you're gonna get lots and lots of stuff
and it's percentage distribution that you're going to want
it's not uh i went here
i s you know it's not like person walking
i went here i stayed here
it's it's more like a fly hovering
mm-hmm
so you need to know the percentage of time it was on during that fixation
mm-hmm
yeah
because if you if you take them as separate events you get thousands of separate events
uh m m i uh i yeah but the p sort of start and end times will give you back to that output
mm-hmm
a as a and then you just measure it against you know the c the c yeah the cumulative total time record or something
against bigger frames
okay so the percentage is i i is a cut it's not something you're using for measurement
so
it's a cut off for whether or not it counts as a fixation
well that's the that's the problem
is that
there are two ways of doing it
one is that there's always a cut off right
mm-hmm
but the other is that there will be a time span a kind of reaction to some event span
b uh uh m yeah so i'll i'll lag in some of it during the i suppose there's the the saccadic movement itself for example
right
right
and so i mean there are there are really two ways of looking at this
one would like to know for example the percentage of time overall in which two people are looking at the same thing okay
mm-hmm
and one would like to know sequences of they didn't look at the same thing and then they broke it
or they did look at the same thing and then they did or didn't brea you know
one one could imagine those two categories
that's that's a kind of testing of our hypotheses
mm-hmm
but there's a certain amount of um dues you pay to the way they do things in the literature to get your papers published
and one of the things they will want to know is an event series after some critical event right
what percentage of time is given to looking where the other guy is looking
and what percentage of time over some you know reasonable time span of a couple of seconds alright
mm-hmm
so they'll be they they'll want to see essentially the gaze settling on particular incidents on particular places
so we have to be able to deliver those two things and they're rather different demands
th th th yeah
right
the it should still come out that the little sketch i asked this p for for last week about n. x. t. and whether it would have that sort of tiered effect so you could see the overlap of where one person is looking compared to the other and their mouse movements and things
yeah
that that should ra uh address all that
'cause all you wanna know is whether they were looking at the same object in the period after
mm-hmm
but but because it's also in the i based on the the time course of the procedure you'll be able to basically get the scan path of the pattern of events from that as well
yeah
okay
can we draw it to make sure that that um that this is satisfying ellen's concerns
yeah yeah
so i did have it somewhere
i didn't have it r uh haven't brought it
right
well there's a white board right
trying to remember it
we love this thing
see if the pens work
so um this is um a. 's eyes right
and b. 's eyes
and i think what you're saying you should probably draw this right is that they you know
if um from this time to this time they're looking at triangle one
w what you're saying is that you want to know in the critical you wanna know after they're they're looking at triangle one what's happening in this period with this guy
right
or how l alright
let's let's imagine a typical construction event okay
mm-hmm
there is some part there are there are separate movable parts on the screen ready for use right
there may be or not a construction already begun right
mm-hmm
somebody makes the first move
there's some kind of communication either gestural imaginary or verbal that plans how we're gonna do it right
mm-hmm
before that happens the person who speaks is going to do some kind of visual scanning
while they're speaking or communicating in some way the other person may or may not be looking where they're looking okay
mm-hmm
they may be overlapping gaze at particular objects which are of interest
let's call it the c the construct existing construct which could be zero
mm-hmm
alright
or the um the addendum the thing which is next going to be added
mm-hmm
next piece okay
now in neither case when you draw this he's looking at triangle one which you're actually drawing you know
for a the period of time in which he's steadily looking at triangle one is gonna be very very short right
mm-hmm
because staring fixedly without interruption blink or or saccade is is an extremely short event
the
uh it m it m uh but uh br at that point they're all of it lumped all the individual fixations as long as it doesn't move off that triangle together as a total sort of gaze gaze time on that
that's fine
so it's in a region it's in a region
yeah
so
yep
yeah
that that's a target within the target region
mm-hmm
okay
but even so you're likely to get bouncing in and out of the region right
uh m
so even so you wanna look at if we're interested in how long before the construction move takes place
um how much of the time they spend looking at the same thing
let's call that our measure of alignment
so they're gonna be yeah that's right a. is gonna be on triangle one and various other places
alright
uh-huh
that's right
and and b. um okay
m yes somewhere
and we're gonna look at the percentage of of that time where they're both in the same region
mm-hmm
right
so what i want to make sure is that we don't um simplify do you know what i mean
so
temporarily simplify too much so that yeah
it it sh yeah it i mean uh as long as we're dif r yeah it there shouldn't be anything missing
'cause then you lose percentage as an as a as a d. v.
right
and so b. has some periods of looking at one and all it will which will also be intermittent
that should be alright
yeah
because
yeah
yep
so you know he might get triangle one there and no maybe this one's gonna overlook lap quite a bit
m m yeah
yeah yeah yeah
right
mm-hmm
so what you want to do is be able to define um bigger periods which is the period when they're sort of interested in triangle one overall right
yes
mm-hmm
this is sort of some meta level analysis
when they should be
so we yeah
so we if we have an an event yeah that that yeah the second line then for the second before it
right
and then we can just take that chunk out and do something with it
yeah
but that's that's not a something that you can do in the n. x. t. query language but it you can't do that in any you know
that should i i
okay
this is such special purpose s but it's easy enough given the data format for any of these things to do that
so you could do it on 'cause i it's just a matter of i the hard part is deciding how close together these have to be before you decide that this is a event that you wanna pull out
right
because you know algorithmically you're you're already putting together i mean this is essentially already you know these fixations with stuff in between
yeah
mm-hmm
yeah
yeah
and uh um you know we we've got an algorithm for deciding when that's a look i guess
mm-hmm
you already have that or no
uh well if it's just based on uh like a a stable fixation for so long or or something and crossing into that region
well
it
oh yeah yeah
yeah
so it's all fixations
they're these are all fixations and saccades but within the yep
yep
right
so that's easy enough
what
so the hard thing is they could be moving their eye arbitrarily here right
and you know maybe even having fixations on other things
yes
mm-hmm
yeah
yes because for example for part of that time both b. and a. are probably looking at the construct okay
yep
if if your intention is to move the red triangle to sit on top of the thing already constructed you would tend to look back and forth
yep
back and forward
mm-hmm
yep
right
so um this isn't yeah
and we should be able to to figure that out
but what you need to do is we we can already build into this g. d. f. format these regions if you can give a definition of what you think that is
but i think the right way to do this is to be able to inspect the data in um some tool and play around with the definitions
because you won't get it right the first time
mm-hmm yeah
yeah sure
so so the question would be under what tool should we be looking at these events
yeah
mm-hmm
and uh elan's a reasonable choice for that right
so
what you need is something well no because you need to
to mm-hmm
y you need to be able to see the effects of this
don't know
so i g i guess this is a case of craig writing some scripts so robin having some ideas about what the relationship is and saying
you know add this data a automatically
it i mean it's not that hard right
it's just there'll be a bunch of these
yeah
you'll have some rules about how maybe how long you spend on other objects and w whether the other object is um the existing construction or not right
right
so so essentially there's there's um a. e. is divided into t. r. one and c. and other stuff okay where c. is the construct the existing thing
and so um
ah right
so if they if they uh they had a fixation on c. you wouldn't be worried
but if they had a fixation on
well no
i mean we'd take a separate we'd look at the percentage time i mean i have no idea because i don't know how people look when they're building things together
okay
so there's a there's the addendum and the and the co the existing construct
and i don't know whether they're gonna spend more time looking at one or the other
but if they're whatever it is that one is looking at if the other's looking the same place they're in good shape
yeah they're yep
but yeah they're gonna look at the clock um and they're gonna look at they may look at completely irrelevant
yeah
sure sure
mm-hmm
and that's what the other stuff that's what the that's what the diagonal stripes are for
that's true
mm-hmm
but we c we can one of the things we'll be doing is um categorising people i take it or interactions by the amount of time people spend looking at the clock
we'd expect that if we put people under time pressure they'll look at the clock a lot more
yeah
more
mm-hmm
but that's like a separate analysis right
sure it's a separate analysis
so
but you don't wanna throw it away right
it no no
so so you can define if all of these things are actually categorised by the eye tracker as to where the eye is alright
the so every separate
yeah
you should be able to pull out any interesting category and say alright for this phase it's t. r. one or c.
mm-hmm
for this phase it's um s. q. one or c. okay
yeah
but what we find e what we can get out of the data easily at the moment is at this kind of level right
mm-hmm
mm-hmm
and then it's a case of defining algorithmically all these other transformations that you want
so this is one uh we hadn't thought of adding before but we should right
which is um well how would you decide whether something was the current addendum uh the cu
you have to actually transcribe the thing or watch the film further on
so that's a human decision
yeah
yeah absolutely
mm-hmm
yeah
yeah
um
yeah
so so m so i assume that well once you've that sort of information you well you got the g. d. f. format
but the ex
yeah
you then filter it to say right between time x. and time y. they're they're constructing that having triangle one to the construct
and then you just say in that time period what percentage are they looking at triangle one
what percentage are they looking at the construct
right
does that sound does that sound reasonable
right
yeah that's the addendum in the construct should be you know kind of they they change their true identity
yep
but they're i their categories of stuff now i w my kind of assumption was that that this was j. p. land
yeah
that that's what he was re what he was really interested in was the kind of coding which would define the building sequence okay
well he's really interested in
right
so and
the and maybe he wants to think about that more and say well there were several candidates for the addendum alright
mm-hmm
so which one does
and and it was the negotiation of which candidate was gonna be the right candidate that's actually the interesting stuff
mm-hmm
so i should talk to him about this
he's he's actually um emailed me with a l with a list of things he wants to discuss at length
but we believe
so i w i'll bring this one back to him
but we believe j. p. to be defining that maybe
well this is my question for him
is he gonna define this kind of building sequence in a way that we can get out
or is he so b i mean you know they've been working on construction there for a while
so it may be that they have a coding system that's ready to go and we should just apply it
yeah
okay
um they do a lot of sub assembly in the tasks they've been doing
mm-hmm
so they may well have a yeah
i could believe them yeah no taking an interest in that
let's find out
i mean the general division was language here and other stuff there right
right
mm-hmm
right
that's what i have understood it to be
so wha right
but well i don't know
i'll just i'll just minute that
what well we but we have the now actions i mean actions might mostly be theirs right
but w uh mm-hmm mm-hmm
but since we have the the eye tracker i th we're gonna have to answer their questions about gaze right
oh yeah eye tracker here
yes uh-huh yeah
right
yeah i mean we know that
yeah i right
but um so they'll they'll uh they'll tell us something about that
but um presumably what you piously hope is happens here is what happened with um transactions
right that the verbal analysis and the um and the visual analysis give you the same breaking points the same chunking points
well yeah
but i mean with transaction coding on something like this you would use i y you wouldn't consider it verbal analysis exactly
it'd be verbal plus action
because it's a task breakdown
well i mean what you know
it's just a segmentation
it's it is it is a task breakdown
but for the verbal version there are ways of announcing that now we're doing a new one right
yeah but you wouldn't have you you wouldn't do two codings for task level one you wouldn't do transaction coding in a action segmentation
or that we're finished with the old one
no you wouldn't
but i mean one of the things one of the things you'd like to establish you know
as an as an outcome of this is that you could analyse either end and you'd get the same chunking of the material
the thing which you guys thought to make in a paper
i i don't think that's realistic because i think what you'd actually do is use um the full record of what you have and do a segmentation
i think it'd be hard to understand what was going on if you used like just the language without watching the video to decide whether we're breaking down the task
it's a hypothesis
oh you don't want it to be coding th uh based on that though and then that seems a strange way to go about things
well
i mean this the language events are multi modal right
you know they're they're doing all these things together
they are doing these things together
but one of the things that you one could imagine doing is um sen is you know
having the transcription there and pl just play it back to a bunch of captive undergraduates and say when do they stop and start
wha why do you care whether they can do it just based on the the language
um because because essentially you're looking at um cycling sequences in discourse
is
and if the discourse tells you what's going on that's information
i mean i g one of the questions is how the information is gonna be shared across these media
and if you can get it all out of the speech you know if the if all of the chunking is available when there is speech
okay then it's carrying a lot of the burden
well it seems to me much less important than the other things one could get out of this data
it's saying we are done with that and
but i you know i it's a possibility
mm
but this is but we haven't looked at data like this with this with our old fashioned analyses um you know
it's mm-hmm
we'll
and i it's it would be really nice to know that that much information that chunking of the task information is being carried by the language
because j. p. 's question the overriding question is so what's language for
you know
if people are busy interacting all the time and all of our colleagues don't even bother to control for whether people are talking to one another when they're doing these joint tasks because it seems to them to be irrelevant 'cause language is irrelevant
it would actually be nice to demonstrate that in a place where we're controlling whether you have language or not
you could get the entire chunking of the task out of a language
yeah
well i c i can see maybe wanting to know whether you can do the chunking just based on the actions without the language in cases where they use both
mm-hmm
mm-hmm
mm-hmm
it's more g i can't quite see why it's important to know that they can do it just based on the language when w you know that they had both
because you know it's a self contained system as opposed to a system which is which can't be interpreted without the other system
uh-huh
well i think that one's just bound to fail
okay
usually the claim
almost all studies on language claim that language is a self contained system which will give you everything you need to know
but yeah
really
that's the claim
okay
alright
anyway
i didn't say it was true
i said that's the claim
and so it's worth testing
so back back to this main problem which is yeah
mm-hmm
w the record that we are getting in the first instance is about the m about these you know they're looking at some region of the screen defined dynamically
mm-hmm
and then we need some way of knowing what the you can you can see adding these other analyses about you know
they're they're jointly focused on this region and trying to figure out what s percentage of time they're looking at it as adding new tiers of information to either the elan track or n. x. t.
they're they're both sort of track based in this way
mm-hmm
um but the hard part is knowing how you wanna do that
and i i think in the first instance what we're trying to get into the g. d. f. format is just this
and then we've got no option but to uh figure out a way for like to look at this just explore this data
suggest ways about doing it and um be able to play them back and see um when we think we've got these things right
i don't think we even know what the set of these things are that we want much less how to get 'em yet
mm-hmm
no no
and we won't and establishing the full set will you know take us much of the project
so th
so you know
yeah that's right
so this is not the you know this is something we're aiming for
but this isn't something that affects what craig programs for the initial g. d. f. translation
you can we can announce now
um
fine
my only concern w uh you a as i said when i barged in was just to make sure that we didn't lose the things that we might need to pick up later
yeah
that's all
so let's just return to this question of frame rate
because this is the thing we were not planning to um transfer into this format
so again you know what a frame rate kind kind of coding is ag it can again be seen as a track
but it says it's a coding like this right where you say it's in state a. state b. state c. state a.
every single frame
well
okay
but since the l the definitions of look a thing we're looking at are d um are the ones which get rid of the lower level
like jiggling around in the area of a particular object right
so if we're moving the the green triangle um we've defined a region which is the dynamically the green triangle wherever it is
mm-hmm
we will jiggle around in there
but it doesn't matter where we are in there
that's beneath our level of analysis
right
mm-hmm
so you right
so i'm just you're happy that it's not gonna have frame rate uh like this
s
well
it's gonna have an interpretation like this
well the in that interpretation is definable to frame rate by our by the only way we're gonna use frame rate
what does that mean
sorry
i c well i mean i because i can i can say for how many frames this fixation went is officially defined
so that as long as i as long as it's not a untimed event okay
yeah all all the all events have a start time and an end time
a and an end time
right
so
so it's you know it's fine
i can say it's a long one
or it's a short one
w right
or it's you know it's twenty milliseconds more than that one
yeah
but it seems to me it seems to me that ellen's concerns might mean we need to add more information to these tags because um
that's
you know this thing in itself is th bunch of fixations right with saccades
uh but y y y
you mean to the tags of the data w within it
yeah
so so things like fixation the number of fixations a and
mm-hmm
fixations and the percentage of time those fixations cover you might want
bi um yeah with some some measure of the so we could work out the number of fixations that made and the average fixation duration as well
because having st long steady fixations can be informative
okay
mm-hmm
and okay i'm i'm asking you as an expert
so number of fixations
percentage of
this is this this isn't a leading question
this is a question question
why would that be informative particularly
um if if they're holding their if there's less dancing around the um the cognitive focus tends to be in one sort of part
uh-huh
so uh there is a difference between if they even though they're still looking at the same part
if they're looking around it uh rather than just holding their gaze steady or um and longer on it
mm-hmm
uh-huh
on it
so you think that if for example if they're looking at um one or another um apex of a triangle it would just that would make a difference
uh yeah
they were exploring the thing as opposed to they were simply alright there is it there it is
it yeah it's it's certainly it's it's worth mm-hmm
okay so th um so that really means that we're not throwing away absolute fixations
uh no i wouldn't want to throw out
the screen location of absolute fixations
put the actual location
no no
this is this is still um uh summary data
mm-hmm
they're he's we're talking about just adding attributes to these things that say the number of fixations that counted as that looking at triangle one right
alright
mm-hmm
uh-huh
so y it's possible
as opposed to out of it
i mean presumably
so you so i thought i understood you to mean exploring the figure
because you know your fixation is a point
and the figures are bigger than points
so you could be exploring the figure or you could be just somewhere in the region defined as the figure but not on it
uh if well yes but that probably isn't going to be easy to get out because you'd then have to break up uh the parts somehow
okay
alright fine
the
so you just want to know the variability of the of the fixation
yep
mm-hmm
and wouldn't that differ from person to person
uh it it yes it can do but it's also looking at it within their their own behaviour to see yeah
okay
so it's the number of different spots within that region where the eye has fixed the number of different fix oh ok okay
uh th w i i would say just the number of fixations
i mean it could just be yeah the number of different yeah
yeah the spots'll be different anyway
so it's a jiggle rate okay
'cause i you're not gonna g have the same pixel
yeah
mm-hmm
yep
exactly
right
so
so um we have the option that we can put in an a. fixation thing here right as well
mm-hmm
if you want the smaller if you want the smaller coding in in here
mm-hmm
i mean to
so that it's not just parsed into this idea of which object
but you also have the raw fixation um data
we can put that in as another track
if you think that that's something that you might want to look at in one of these tools that shows you the tracks against each other
well all i th understood you to ask for was the duration of each fixation inside
yeah i d that's all he asked for
it yeah
yeah
yeah
uh if if we've got everything then i suppose it's you can always yes it's you're not throwing anything away then
well i think
you can come back
yeah and in n. x. t. there's no cost right because the y the uh you just don't choose to load those
or
right
all we're doing is dumping it as output that you can load if you choose to
um i g s you know so if they're things that you just know are crazy and you're not gonna want then we don't do it
okay
mm-hmm
but otherwise we go ahead and dump 'em
right
'cause it's easy to dump out the fixations
um yeah
yeah
so it's the number of different fixations
okay
so it's the number of fixations the did you want the you
well actually do you want the average duration
or do you want the number of different ones
uh but uh uh number uh well the uh duration time as well somehow
whether it's the average one or
duration of each fixation in the region
of the fixation
m not e well if it's each you have to d you have to break it down into another tier right
well
yeah
you can't you can say there were three fixations and they averaged uh a certain time
the the average should be alright uh to work with
but you don't wanna
d well what about the the overall sum of the durations
the the
is that i mean which way do you want to
well you've already got that
uh well if you've got the number of fixations in the average time you can then just generate it
yeah then that's that's the way you want it
that way around
yeah yeah
okay
so that's a measure of jiggle in the region roughly
mm-hmm
and uh y did you want the percentage of time fixated as opposed to which is sort of another view of this number
uh
moving
you can have as many of these as
again uh that that should be you should be able to derive that presumably from
yeah
well it's not um the the extra cost of having these as attributes is not high
so um you know
it saves you i uh having to do write scripts to do arithmetic on that later if you know that these are numbers that are gonna be useful to you
okay
right
what's our error of measurement on location on the screen
so to what degree do we actually know whether the two little eyes little circles are exactly in the same place or just somewhere in the same region
uh that it can vary a bit depending on the calibration
but if we're building in a sort of error margin um it it will be based on pixels around
right okay
right
but there'll also be a minimum one
'cause i'm trying to think that it's probably the small the actual mouse icon is so small
mm-hmm
it'll need a slightly larger uh just because if what you have i is a sort of larger error or of b error margin around it
it's yeah okay right
s
okay
so my question was going to be alright the the mouse is a dynamic object right
yeah
the eye track is a dynamic object
or is it only the the piece that the eye tra the other person's eye track is on that's that's an object in this definition
uh no
the o the other person's gaze position as well
is a is an object
mm-hmm
yep
okay
trea treated the same as as the mouse say
with some with plus or minus something or other yeah around it
yep
mm-hmm
some circular area
yes yep
okay
and
um so you can be on the object but not on the other person's gaze
so there can be a triangle which has a. 's gaze in the centre and your gaze actually happens to be here
yes
so if there uh if mm-hmm
yes
you're in the triangle region
mm-hmm
does this
but not looking at their individual and pr fact they probably will avoid looking directly
okay
because if they're looking directly at it it's obscuring
the the part
but it's directly added when when these two in this situation when these two overlap right like this
mm-hmm
yeah mm-hmm
okay
yeah 'cause i think that that's gonna co that's 'cause b the diagram we got there suggesting that they're only looking thing at time
so whether it's triangle or whatever else
mm-hmm
but so what you're suggesting there is they can be looking at the triangle and maybe a mouse pointer and maybe an eye at the same time
mm-hmm
yeah
mm-hmm
mm-hmm
mm-hmm
the
okay okay
well it would come up it would say yes right
i mean because they would be in the same place
i don't know
so if you y you're gonna have dynamic regions which overlap one another by definition
mm-hmm
mm-hmm
if the mouse is on the construct then right right
the m the mouse the gaze and the part are all layered
yeah
yep
yeah yeah
well well but y those are different tracks of information
'cause you get c 'cause you
so what you want is one track of information about which object it's one one about whether or not it's on the other guy's gaze
right
and one about whether it's on um one of the mouse positions
we treat those as as other objects
but the difference between them and the the parts of the c thing to be constructed is that they're allowed to overlap with other things so nothing breaks
okay
yeah but i in in the analysis you should treat those as completely separate tracks of information
if we mm-hmm
because they can be looking at they could look sim simultaneously at somebody's mouse somebody's gaze and some object right
ye
mm-hmm
yes as opposed to simply looking at somebody's gaze when the mouse isn't also there right
so
yeah
and you want to know those things
yep
so the these are independent
right they're i they're independent dynamic objects
so so what we want is whether they're looking at s at the other person's gaze right
mm-hmm
and say they are in this period well i mean uh they're probably not given what i've trying to
okay
so a definition of we're all looking at and touching the same thing
so imagine that we've just added a piece to the construct alright
mm-hmm
so now that's the construct
and both mouse symbols are on it right
yeah
mm-hmm
and both gazes are on it right
yep
so at that point you should have a line up of a. is on the construct a. is on the mouse
a. is on a. is on a. 's mouse a. is on b. 's mouse a. is on b. 's gaze and b. likewise
mm-hmm
yeah
okay
so g so there's there's a lot of tracks here right
right
because well we just added this fixation track
ooh i love the eraser
and then there is a. 's mouse not their eyes is on an object right
mm-hmm
and the mouse might be on triangle one
yeah but the mouse is also a dynamic object
but it doesn't matter
i mean i the mouse we're just saying where is the mouse
that's fine
okay
mm-hmm
you know it's on this object
mm
and then um a. 's eye is on well a. 's mouse i guess right
a. 's eye might be looking at a. 's mouse here
a. 's eye might be looking at b. 's mouse here right
i mean these are all the different ways of taking cross products at the things that could be co located
mm-hmm
right
so you just treat 'em as independent
and i'm guessing from what you say yeah
and then you then you look for combinations of them
yeah
i guessing from what you're saying you want all these tracks
i think we need to
because tha some measure of alignment is looking where the other guy is directing attention
yeah which is fine
there's no problem with that at all
mm-hmm
and there are two measures of where the other guy is directing attention that you get from the visual track
one is where the mouse is and the other is where the gaze is
yeah
so
s so um uh you kinda got the idea here
yep yep
okay yeah
yeah
so so yeah
so so it's just a matter of adding these the two mouse pointers and the um two gazes as extra objects
mm-hmm
um so yeah
as long as as long as they've got an i. d. in there we can just say right at this p between these times they're looking at that object or they're looking at the mouse
right
right
mm-hmm
they're looking at whatever
but the important thing is you don't treat that entire set as mutually exclusive and exhaustive
so
it's just so tha the objects is like a separate level of analysis
yeah that actually true
mm-hmm
be 'cause
if whether they're looking at the objects than whether they're looking at the gaze
right
'cause they can happen at the same time
but that it's also gonna be the case that um whatever region you define as the region of the dynamic object of the red triangle may get to the point where it overlaps the region of the dynamic object of the green square
yep
okay what do we do about that
does that happen
yeah because if you have them close together there's always some fuzz factor around them
uh uh if when they get moved together
oh right
mm-hmm
and so if they're left lying close together okay or in the in fact in the model in the not in the model
it
uh-huh
mm-hmm
in the in the supplies set they're actually neatly packed into a little space
okay
mm-hmm
so what you're saying is like a new problem for us which is i'm gonna change
mm-hmm
two objects close together your eye gaze can actually be looking at the left edge of one and the right edge of the other
that's the bad one
mm-hmm
and they're sor therefore looking at two objects at once
yeah
yeah
so you're saying
squeak squeak
saying they need some new pens
okay
yes
can you write on my pen pad
new pens
just say yeah pens
pens
white board pens
white board pens
so you're saying you know they could be looking at um uh square one at this point
i confuse 'em
'cause they
because the two are so close together that their regions overlap
close together
okay that's a problem for the data models and either of the things that we were using
mm-hmm
mm-hmm
yeah
uh unle uh but it uh unless we just define it as there's only they're they are exclusive
that would
and which ever area m has the greatest overlap is what they're actually looking at
what do you mean by greatest overlap
the greatest overlap with what
well it w if if you've got your sort of eye position
ho ho
and it's it's unlikely to be exactly fifty percent in one object and fifty percent in the other
draw uh my g my uh spacial reasoning is no good
uh
yeah
well i uh uh put these things on
i think i think you're throwing information away
see uh i i'm the one that uses the white board
'cause i actually put the the microphones on
yeah
uh uh what i'm i'm thinking is if you've got say one object there and right
you know so this is
uh this is the better pen
thank you
uh part one and part two
and you've got they're sort of they're looking
there
uh-huh
then that overlap means they're looking at the two pieces simultaneously
yeah
but
but you had a way of choosing which one right
yeah
yeah uh just if this is there's more of it uh yeah i yes
but it may be a bad idea
it may be a bad idea
you've just thrown data away
yeah
uh that's w uh that's that's a decision we'll uh uh uh i'm saying is if they're looking if most of what their overlap is here then we stick with that one
yeah
well thing is that with
j
so you just mean which i is it closer to the is the circle i mean what is this circle
well
they're looking at a pixel or something right
uh that's th we no that because um the gaze position will be a sort of fuzzy area
it won't just be a pixel
it'll it'll be an actual like circle and area
the gaze will wobble
right
yeah
the gaze will wobble
so i i it it that's that's going to be w uh it's it's not just a single point
that's natural
s right
oh so those vary in size
it's it's a it's a sort of lump target
mm-hmm
yeah yeah
and so there'll be a bit of a a sort uh some sort of overlap of two objects
mm-hmm
yeah
or indeed they might be looking from one to another
or b yeah they could just be oscillating mm-hmm
yeah
d or deciding which one to choose or thinking so you don't want to decide it's only one and throw the other one out
they could be
yeah
thing thing is w. g. d. s. formats is wor is working at the moment
it's actually got a separate track for each part
mm-hmm
okay well that's fine
so
that i was going to say that's the obvious way to do it
oh but what pain that's gonna be analytically
yeah
because it's gonna how many parts are there
well each one is yes or no
well the
like
well the the the it depen depends on the depends on what you build in
couple of dozen
there's different parts there's different parts whether you're doing the tamgram or whether you're doing an airpa airplane or whatever
right
um
six to a dozen usually
okay
but th but sa but thing is if if we if we got if we got tracks for each for each part we can we can easily analyse it down later on
i know ways of getting around this analytically
mm-hmm
'cause you c
yeah
i mean i think it's very likely that um if people are considering f mm-hmm
mm-hmm
uh i mean if if they are oscillating though then that's presumably going to st change the weight
so you are actually going to see them flipping between uh when you decide they're looking there mm-hmm if they're really close yeah
well not if the regions overlap okay
if they're really close to each other it's gonna get foxed
if the regions i
yeah
right
yeah
and if you define the regions so neatly that there's that
mm-hmm
you know that we're losing gaze because of jiggle outside this closely defined region when it's in the middle of space then
h yes
i mean i i actually like the solution however ugly it it looks in terms of a data format of having a track for every possible object of gaze
yeah well the
it's not the data format i'm worried about
it's the um the way you do the analysis
because you don't wanna have to say um you know did they jointly look at triangle one
okay
did they jointly look at square one
okay
did they jointly look at you know you need some way of uh uh going over the whole thing
mm-hmm
s a thing
mm-hmm
but i c we can find ways around that
well okay
i think for now we we do it this way and then we we think about what we need out of it in the end
so
it's just you know in elan it that has the side effect that if you go for the naturalistic way of of up translating to elan
hmm
mm-hmm
there'll be a zillion tracks
and it'll probably ruin their viewer
'cause you'll get very sparse data on each track
uh-huh
it'll be like the old referring expression generalis uh uh visualization um the map task
you know where they talk about one object one landmark and then another landmark
mm-hmm
mm-hmm
i always thought that was brilliant
well it's big right
yeah it is big and you do have to scroll through it to see what's going on
but it gives you a very clear picture of what's going on
well we'll see if elan likes it or not
yeah well okay
but so we'd we'd better do a test one and and listen to them scream
the yeah
yeah and we b we better also like have in the representational list of par like even in the n. x. t. up translation a list of parts
with parts
it it affects the way we do the n. x. t. u up translation and make things easier for people
yeah
right
so i mean so
yeah
well the the the the doesn't really list part in the in the g. d. f.
um so yeah
that that that's not a problem
there so that bas basically what i've got is well there there there's places where you got the i. d. though
so you've the an i. d. for a part you got an i. d. for a location on the screen
mm-hmm
so it shows you the target config the clock whatever else
um and then we can easy add i. d. s for the two mouse points and the two gazes
um and from that and ba basically all all the all the tracks are doing is saying at this between this time there's a look at this o this object
yeah th this i. d.
um so uh so it's effectively a track for each i. d.
okay
so what about the point where a part becomes the construct
the th yeah the but but
do you still identify it as a part
i mean i think one should lose that i take it
well wha wha what happen what happens there is that the the two the the existing parts basically cease to exist and a new part with a new i. d. starts existing at the point where they're joined
'cause
mm-hmm
mm-hmm
right
mm-hmm
so you cha so every time a part is added to the construct it becomes a new part
so the construct actually um has say it has six things that are added to some initial thing okay
so if there's just the initial thing you've put it in the middle of the screen that's just the initial object right
yep
soon as you put a part there's a construct
but it's construct one
because when you add another part construct one ceases to exist and you get construct two right
mm-hmm
yeah
so actually defining all of those as the construct is gonna be the trickiest thing
uh i it's also going to be a problem uh because you're going to have one part or a construct forming in the middle of a fixation
well the
right
so it's not gonna be quite as clear if you can't can't chop it off
right
so you're you're looking at triangle one right and all of a sudden it ceases to exist
uh-huh
and then it yes
and it suddenly becomes and there could be more than one construct at a time right
and it becomes construct or assembly whatever two
yeah
oh
it's there is no the construct right
'cause you can build sub assemblies
no
and then you can start again
you can build sub sub assemblies and then link the the part really yeah
also when you when you screw it up you g start again
yeah
what why does it why does construct one become construct two when you add something to it
because the definition
yeah that that that that's what that's what that's the way he's working the moment
because it uh th it's it's generating a new i. d. when you c when you create a new part
i so each
yeah
um
oh and this is because we don't want it to stay triangle one when you start with a construct it's not a construct at all
it's just a one thing
and we don't want triangle one to suddenly have bigger stuff
mm-hmm
well the problem is that all of these things are popping out of existence
yeah
so do we know the difference between um we broke it and it went away and um it's now part of the construct
um yeah
but there there's there's joint events
so if the if a joint event if if if it's there's joint event linked to linked to the item then you know it's become part of a construct
um of um
can we ta can we tag the constructs with what's in them
yeah the the the yeah
yeah yeah there are
wai w i th uh
the con the con the constructs are already tagged with that
yeah
there are
so that i'm act there's actually a s a separate file of the data format which says for each construct
which which two parts made it made that came together to make that construct
which constituent parts
okay
so we could we could essentially well
then we could cumulati or it is a new construct 'cause it has a new list of a new cumulative list of parts right
yeah
but you can still ta you can still track what parts went into it
but we will
right
so
so you can still find triangle one whatever
so some fancy programming's gonna have to be done to say i was looking at triangle one and now i'm looking at triangle one in construct one
'cause the first construct was triangle one and square one okay
yeah
yeah
but but that's easy n uh it's easy to do because the the co each construct has the i. d. s for the pa the things that construct it
alright
so now we have to ask whether um
so l let's imagine this we've made a construct of two parts and we're c i a triangle and a square
and we're considering now adding something on to the side of the square that isn't attached to the triangle
mm-hmm
okay
are we looking at the square or we looking at the construct
yeah
construct
that was the next question i had
yeah
yeah
you'll be looking at the construct
'cause that's the way it's dis defined
uh in this definit should be looking at the construct
yeah
there isn't a way to figure out that you're looking at the square rather than the triangle
yeah
well we'll d yeah well with the yeah d well thing is that we we still have the x. wa the x. wave traces from the ascii formats
looking at areas within it
so if if you want if you want to be able to say i'm looking at a square instead of i'm looking at the construct
mm-hmm
that's it is possible to get that data out
um it's it's yeah
it is
oh yeah
it's it's not doing it's not doing it in the gest analyzer at the moment
but i can easily add it to give that information if you want
well
okay because i mean that's that's the example m f presumably that's the best example of overlapping overlapping areas
'cause if if the thing the two s the two things are now abutted
of course there's an area which is common to both of them okay
mm-hmm
that'll cover most of 'em
um so what i'm trying to run through in my head is that we can always tell the difference between um something going out of existence 'cause it's joined to construct something going out of existence 'cause we threw it away
right
suppose we pick up an we we we screwed up the first time we put the triangle with the square and we threw it away and decided we didn't like it
mm-hmm
hmm
and we took another one
is it triangle one
is it triangle one prime or something like that
it's the replacement for triangle one
i yeah
yeah if if you take it if you t if you crea if you create a new part it uh it gets a new i. d.
it's triangle two
mm-hmm
so if you get if you drag a new part out of the parts bin
well how do i know what it replaces
uh
you don't because that's you'd have to have human coding to do that
yeah there might be multiple triangles that you've broke and you won't know which one they're planning on using it for
yeah i mean the we e
uh w
n n
uh this is true
but if i have triangles one two three right and i throw them away any triangles i take out are to replace one two three
well you know which mold they come from
and so you know which shape they match
okay
but you can't possibly know which one of the ones they're meant to replace
yeah i mean you know whi you know which way they match
except that ex no you don't know which one they're meant to replace
so you can
but you know they're not meant to replace any that are all that are that haven't been thrown away
they can't replace uh the new parts only appear when the previous one's broken
okay
right
so the new parts are replacing those which have disappeared from the screen
yes
and if there's no more t. r. one track the t. r. one track is gone now
they ca they can appear without them
you c
oh so there's no two parts with the same shape
yeah the
oh there are many
uh with same shape but not the same shape and colour
then
same identity
uh same eye
oh same shape and colour
yeah
right okay
yep
oh is that true
you've decided not to make all the triangles red and squares green and
well that's well that's that's what they're at the moment
oh okay
oh okay
so you can tell what it's meant to replace then
uh
right
because it's the same it's uh just a case of the mold right
one two and three
they
yes
so that's the way it works at the moment
uh i just assume that's how ni nijmegen had set it all up
okay
so
th that's that's back to uh tim's day
so there
yep
so shape plus colour
they are individual uh you have different colours for the yep
okay
they're unique
unique yeah
yep
all the parts are unique
so wai hang on
that makes the task a little bit easier right
yes
the tam tamgrams are much easier when you can see
the uh all the lines
mm-hmm
yep
so
it is just a construction task rather than a puzzle
indeed
which kind of leaves you with an obvious way of making the same task harder and easier doesn't it
yep
yeah
but the this also
but but that's hard to code
i mean that's really a thing we might do
okay
so now let's make sure that the coding would survive that
it's just it's a beautifully controlled situation
the construction task is essentially the same
mm-hmm
it's the figuring out stuff that gets harder if everything is purple
mm-hmm
for a just to choose a colour at random here
yeah
mm-hmm
yeah
so yeah
yeah
yeah so i think that anything's loading
there's there's then two triangle isn't there
there's two identical triangles in the tamgram
uh yes
um
it at the moment there are d uh there are two i think two small ones and two large triangles
they're actually the same physical size and shape
mm-hmm
at the moment they're in different colours
that also means in the p new parts list they're there for you know two v large triangles and two small one small ones say
whereas in in the revised edition if they were all just black there'd only be one uh mold in the new parts
mm-hmm
yeah
mm-hmm
we in when you specify these things do you specify the molds or does it figure out what the molds are based on
so is this hard wired into tim's program
or is it just an artifact of the way we s
as far as i know it's hard wired
it just appears so
well yeah yeah
when you when you specify the molds in the in the in the p the file that c that generates the parts like a list of parts
the molds are bas just taken out of the the file that generate that specifies the parts
right
okay
mm-hmm
so so ho however many part however many mo however many parts there are in the file that's how many parts appear in the in the parts box
the polygon one polygon two whatever it might be
so it's hard wired
so if you have five black triangles there gonna be five black triangles in the parts box
or one
if you have five black triangles gonna be five five parts in the fi five black black triangles in the parts box
uh-huh
so minor modification needed for
but what what what but what you can do well if in the in the initial configuration you can re use a triangle
mm-hmm
mm-hmm
mm mm-hmm
so if you so if you only want one black triangle
you just create one black triangle in the parts box and then re use that pa that triangle five times in the configuration
mm-hmm
mm-hmm
mm-hmm
okay
as long as it this is possible
so c that that just is a kind of thing which is so simple
yep
so much like a single one zero variable change that it if it that doesn't already exist
hmm
yep same same pieces
uh but what were the req wha
'cause i'm tr i'm trying to kinda map this onto baufix
um and baufix has has multiple you know all the the
has multiples yeah
mm-hmm
the the v the nuts are are red or and all the um flat things are wood colour something
mm-hmm
mm
no so they they can have different uh nuts there
w well nuts that are different colours
the same part the same part is different colours
but same part in different colours yeah
oh yeah
yeah uh but they don't have enough to make unique
no what i mean there's more than they're multiple pieces that look the same
mm-hmm
mm-hmm
so what
so when you say a red nut or a green bolt or a long green bolt then there'll be lots of them lying around
and i think that's how the robot is set up to there are five five green bolts
yeah
mm-hmm
so i th
mm-hmm
uh here is one you know
i think we've gotten to the point where you know to try to summarise
uh we we think tim's program can do both of these conditions that you want
okay
mm-hmm
okay
but i'm still worried about what the uh effects are for analysis
so
because you were aiming at something in um the g. d. f. format and i wasn't quite sure what
okay
and w
so w uh all i'm i'm doing is kind of worrying out loud about all the things that will happen that we'll miss by th a simple view of for example regions and looking at at triangle one
yeah
when is triangle one not triangle one anymore
so so okay
um does it s keep its identity
so i'll summarise what we said about that part that um every time you cast off a new part from a mold or
mm
you know every black triangle has a different i. d.
identity yes
and you know it's a black triangle 'cause you know which mold it came from
but you don't know which part it was intended to replace on the screen because you can't mind read
yep
mm-hmm
that's true
so how can we define the shapes that people build
what do you mean define
well
if assuming i was for a moment i was j. p. and i wanted to know how they actually went about building the thing
okay
and i wanted to um to look at the strategy
and i wanted to see if the strategy was different when we could talk about it and when we just picked up whatever
i mean suppose i can't talk to you and i'm doing this task with you and i can't talk to you
mm-hmm
um
the thing which is gonna be hardest for me is making elaborate plans with you
i can reach for the next thing and you can go where i reach
but if i have some you know sub goal some long term sub goal
of doing something clever with putting these together 'cause it's hard and then putting these together 'cause it's hard
there it's gonna be almost impossible to convey that to you
and the difference in the history of construction right is an important thing and i wonder how we can get that information back
mm
i think that this is a human coding that is part of the action coding
do you think
because i don't see how anybody but a person watching this can guess why they cast off this thing at this time
no it why is not uh that's that's not the question i'm asking
the question i'm asking is what's the history of the construct
so you have the n the names of the things in there
and you have two constructs suppose we have two sub constructs
and whichever one had two pieces put together first is the earlier numbered of those constructs right
yep
how do you tell the difference between adding a piece to this first construct and creating a second construct
well when the when the f when the final construct the the way the the way the the constructs are defined in the file
mm
you've got like your p your parent construct and the parts that it's constructed out of
okay
um and yeah as i say the
it's it's it's parent child relationship
yeah yeah
so you got parent child relationship and i the child can be a part or it can be another construct
okay
so construct two could b um construct one is um a red triangle and a green square
construct two is um two green squares okay
construct three right is a red triangle a green square and another red triangle
construct four okay
yeah but that's okay 'cause they all have different underlying part numbers
and when you say what a construct
okay
and you can so how are we gonna tell when for example you think we're gonna have to do human coding on when two sub constructs are put together
no that's a definition wherein a construct has a c has constructs as children
no
no no
yes
yeah yeah
yes
'cause uh there's a joint action
okay
the result the t what you need for a join action you need to yeah a construct and a part two parts whate whatever you're taking together
mm-hmm
okay
and then the result of that is a construct
you've got time when that happens
you can see that construct appeared at that time
right
um and you can still track the children of that construct
so we could zip we could zip through this and look at all the um all the interactions in which people build sub construct contstructs first which we expect them to do bu as a wild hypothesis more when they have verbal communication than when they don't
mm-hmm
okay
and we can do that by simply searching for any constructs that have constructs as children
yep
yeah
so we can easily look at things like that automatically
okay
mm-hmm
it's just the why they g why they get new parts that's the problem for us
we can't if they suddenly if they decide to get a part of a mold we don't know we can't know why until they do something with it
mm-hmm
if they do
yeah we haven't actually made a rule that you can't uh collect extra parts right
and the extra parts don't appear
so you can't collect them
oh yeah you said that
yeah
um
there there are a couple of them that it's like greyed out
they really very faint
yeah but you can
so you see the mold is there
but they don't come filled uh until
no no
i mean you have to b you have to break one to get one okay
but you can break you you can but you can break one when you break one you don't cast off the mold yourself it happens automatically
yes
yes
oh okay never mind then
i i it appears in the new p uh like uh suddenly the th th the new part lights up sort of thing and it's there
so they just have to use it yeah
uh-huh
oh but they have to drag it up past the mold line
yes
yeah
they have to bring it into play
mm-hmm
and you can't just bring extras in case you screw up
no
you have to screw up first and then you can bring an extra
nope
that yeah
that that is one think unlike the say the baufix or anything
mm-hmm
we i assume the the baufix
yeah where there's extra parts
mm-hmm
the there aren't any extra parts
mm
mm-hmm
and at the moment the software doesn't a allow for that
i but it does have replacement
yes
yeah
replacement but no superfluous so you can't have a a standard stock with extra parts that it'll never use
mm-hmm
yeah
mm-hmm
okay
there there's a so you so so you appreciate you appreciate the cost of
so this why question doesn't even arise because
mm-hmm
mm-hmm
'cause you know what they're gonna do with it
screwing up
when they decide to move it past the mold line they're p doing something with it probably and you'll know what they're gonna do with it because
yeah
mm-hmm
yeah well by by the by the time by the time they're doing that they must have already broken something
mm-hmm
they do it
mm-hmm that's right
so you'll so you'll know what they're replacing
yeah
yeah
so
right
mm-hmm
okay
so they rejected something or they broke something inadvertantly
okay
is there a way of
telling the difference between intentional and unintentional breakages
intentional um in the sense that they break deliberately when they bring them into the new parts
how would you do that
bec yeah
but they c you know it's like the trash can idea that they bring a
no you p they both put they both put their hands on a construct because they don't like it
yeah but there's there'd be no way of coding that automatically right
how could you possibly do that
you have to hope that there's language and one of them says something
mm-hmm
but that's a human coding right
you c mm-hmm
yep
so that just has to be coded
uh there's no there's there's no way you could tell that just from the the raw movements or or something
mm-hmm
mm-hmm
um not generically
so w
mm yep
because they'll if they're gonna do it by gesture they'll build up a convention right
so uh that's gonna particularly be a problem for j. p. right
what else do we need to know
remember m all the things we're looking at are f with language with and without language
and it's gonna be very difficult to tell whether they broke something intentionally without the language
which means it's probably not
unless they develop a convention
suppose they start off with language and then they they say hey look you know let's do it like this
yeah okay
yeah
but th um this is properly part of the action coding
it
i
sure
so we should well we should make a wish list right as a side effect
absolutely
i just i just wanna make sure that a wish list yes
although
yes
what i'm trying to remember is if the people deliberately break things by moving two pieces together
they they don't both break
uh they do
they both they both
if if if what if one if one person's trying to get a part to a part that isn't that that so the part that's just sitting on the screen that's not being touched
they both break
mm-hmm
so the i intentional thing is when they actually both click on the same object and it breaks
for sure you know that's and l or well n is not necessarily intentional
no they could just make a mistake or screw up yeah
yeah
they could just screw up
yep
yeah
mm
they could discuss deciding to break something and and then one guy does it
mm-hmm
yeah
y yeah
or i don't think that's very good no we'll never get away with that we'll get a bad score
but that's bringing in the the language thing again
yeah yeah
mm-hmm
let's just throw that away and start again yeah
mm-hmm
mm-hmm
yeah
okay
which reminds we have fixed the score problem
have we
uh well yeah
'cause yeah
c 'cause it was through the rotational part
oh uh yes
at the the percentage score
right
yeah
yeah
so our yes rather than the number of penalties or or something
no the the score w uh is fine
was the percentage overlap and that made the score
yeah
uh ye that's that's the way it's worked out
that's when i left
but uh uh the problem was um to do with the m the p they had a relative and absolute piece and uh it's all to s to the symmetry of that
oh yeah well do you know which which which which one was the top right
yeah
mm-hmm
but that's all been fixed
so as long as it's defined fine
that's that's that's back
yes
yep
it wasn't it wasn't a bug
it it it was a
don't tell me it was a feature
uh well
no no
uh yes it was something that had to be defined and the uh dutch lot didn't
it was them just dr uh forgetting to um define an attribute they had to
alright
yeah
oh okay
so that was it was actually their their fault
well whi which is probably a documentation fault right
yeah i mean i'm
oh
so
but um it's not clear enough in the documentation
i've th i've yeah
it's it's in the documentation
hmm
yeah
yeah
but it's like two thirds of the way down a quite a long page
but i it it is quite fundamental and uh causes quite immediate problems if you don't know about it
but
the right
yeah
so
not prominently flagged
yep exactly
okay
yep
yeah
a communication flaw
but um
okay
so we can now that's now just lovely
and there won't be any crazy scores anymore
yeah
is there a y yeah
well while we're on past things is there anything else you wanna tell us about the prior part of this
which is the you know what else is he holding you up from
or oh we're well we yeah
we should should go back to the beginning
the um camtasia was tested last week and initially we were a bit worried because uh in the old version it seemed to interfere with it
oh
i have to use a new page
uh-huh
but uh when you when craig re compiled it and did his new version it started wor wor it seems to work fine
yeah
right
yeah
so it doesn't slow down the eye tracker
um
it doesn't do anything nasty
so we we p so we pay for it and
nothing we can tell
no
no the the the there's there's very small graphical bugs
no uh
but it's it's not it's not big thing
mm-hmm
it's like couple of white pixels uh in the course of a in the course of a the course of a task
so it's there's distracting
nothing important and noth nothing big enough they're gonna look at it right
no
no
alright
so the last i think i'm sorry you know i had as assorted emails from you and i was probably didn't catch everything
the problem was that there are two camtasia records
yes
there will now have to be two camtasia records because uh e each person actually sees a different screen because of the gaze feedback
they don't see their own gaze
they don't see their own gaze to the other person
they see the o only the other guy's gaze right
yep
yeah
so there'll need to be two separate camtasia videos generated
yeah yeah
i know
oh do you need two copies of camtasia to do that
hopefully we won't
huh-huh
you mean officially
or uh
yeah but then the que the que the question is there a licence for camtasia where you just need one editing c thing and two recording things
'cause yeah the r the recording yeah the recording thi pro program is just quite a it's quite a small program
they just gen it just generates the video and so i don't know don't know if it's worth having a look at the licensing for that just to see
okay
i mean
yeah i hadn't thought about the i was assuming we'd just get one and one licence both of us
so you're gonna look into this right
check out
suppose technically we should have two because it'll be two machines
well y c look at the licence conditions it might not
i suspect that it will
it'll be per machine i would think
i c i never pre judge licences until i've read 'em
hmm
okay
i i'll have a uh yeah i'll have a l a look at the actual camtasia licence
so we
um the other thing we're we
so uh well and um hold on before we get go any further
so this has implications for data storage right
because w um it means we've got well no this is three times right 'cause we've got oh no
it 'cause it's now twice twice the size of a
mm-hmm
we're gonna build we're gonna use javascript to build the videos on the fly right 'cause it's fast
so the the permanent storage is just the camtasia stuff
yeah
so uh is that a problem
where are we putting things
is there mm
uh mm
hmm
mm-hmm
mm-hmm
is there such a thing um as um you know dual track video
because you can certainly mix things
um what ideally one wants one doesn't really want to l to have these things
uh um because we're using them for back up and for coding
we don't really want to play them independently
oh we can we can put 'em in the same thing right
we do almost always want to use them in exactly in parallel
time aligned
mm-hmm
you can dump 'em into one video frame if you don't mind losing resolution
but that's maybe a problem right because
well the other problem is uh camtasia has to be manually launched on both machines separately
so the synchronization's gonna be a problem
yeah
um what are we doing for synchronization otherwise
uh during the task there is a flash and a bleep
oh i mean not during the task
uh before
for each task
yeah before the task
yes
okay
so that we'd have to re align them
we couldn't dump them from their start points
yes
well maybe you could
the thing that you're dumping them onto just starts running with the flash and the bleep
you turn on the two copies whenever at different times
but they're still no
is the what what i th what are they i don't really understand the the parts that are operating here
uh camtasia y yeah
two videos are turning on
there is no time stamp that comes from some common source
but
no they're they're on two s the two separate machines and the you you start and end them separately
no
mm-hmm
the they they're not talking to each other
they're just recording
you start it recording and it starts recording what's on one screen
right
and you start the other recording on the other machine
right
so
and they're they're totally separate
okay
they don't know about the other one
these are ba these are back ups
right
so the flash get allows you to hand synchronize them later if you need to by stripping extra video off the front
right is there a div mm
mm-hmm
mm-hmm
as long as you make sure you start 'em before the flash then you're fine
yep
mm-hmm
yep
but it will there's a a cost of having to go to back up which is synchronizing them
mm-hmm
so they'll include things like the um the eye tracker calibration right which is not a bad thing actually
yes
because sometimes you wanna go back and find out if this was just a particularly duff subject
uh yeah
see how how long it took them actually
that's that's true
how long did it take them to calibrate
right
yeah
or yeah
and hand every time we re calibrated the damn thing slipped yeah
how many t how many times before uh the validation worked or something
yeah that's true
oh okay
that actually helps
so you so you should start the camtasia really early then
i uh
i mean that ni
right
well it at the moment the that's what i was assuming on on on doing that uh it's done first
yep
mm-hmm
right
okay
right
no they that actually saves you hours trying to make somebody's data smooth out when it won't
mm-hmm
because yeah
you go back and actually yes they were crap
isn't that the answer
that's a technical term
that's a a technical categorization in psychological research
yeah
um yes
the other thing we were getting sorted out was the the microphones
'cause only one of the uh camtasia videos will actually have the soundtrack
and that's because
uh we're just getting we've got one cable and to the two mics
i suppose we can do it is it would it be worth splitting it
well we need sound we we need real sound recording right
that's that's two track
that's stereo
uh yeah
so the at at at the moment it's ins well
what we've finally just uh at twelve o'clock today looks like we've got it sussed um is to get one channel one microphone being the left channel and one being the right channel to merge into a stereo single file
alright
uh-huh
uh-huh
uh unfortunately the on one machine
on w on what
uh sorry
uh
on one of the
the display p. c. s
con
yeah the camtasia v video
o o it's uh
or m m multi media thing
on camtasia
that's not where you're putting it
mm
i mean u
that's our only sound record
yeah
yes
well okay you've got the proper sound record
but you're not dumping it through camtasia to record it right
it it's
you're
yep
it's camtasia that's recording it
what before we were gonna use camtasia at all what well what we were gonna do what were we going to do with the sound
mm
mm-hmm
uh-huh
yeah
so uh ha wou is there any sound degradation that comes about from putting this through camtasia rather than running it out straight
how good is it
yeah
have to really question
no you got you
yeah you got exactly the same access to sound quality as you got from anythi anything else on the windows
mm-hmm
so you can you decide whatever quality you want
so got a bit of
okay
so what you're planning on doing it is bunging it on one of the camtasia tracks and then splicing it off the camtasia track
it's an easy bit of yeah
and then you're gonna bung it on the other camtasia track too if you need it right
and then then they can do sound analysis on that
but we'll just we're gonna store all three separately then
and the sound is going to start at the same time as one of that arbitrary one of the camtasia videos
but you'll know when the real experiment you'll know the relationship between that and the eye tracker timings
uh yeah
because the the synchronization the audio and vi the audio visual synchronisation comes at a specific point in the eye track file
yeah
no human intervention required
it's time stamped
no it's yeah th it's i i sta stamped into it
so it's just after just after it prints the line starting experiment uh uh yeah
i'll i'm pretty sure it's just yeah
yeah
yep
but ho hold on
do we need that
i mean it i i thought the way that tim had this set up originally
um the audio uh w the time stamps used there would be joint time stamps between the audio and the eye tracker so that you know
uh the audio record ten seconds in was the same as ten seconds into the eye tracker record so that we didn't have to do any extra hand work
you know any uh chopping the starts of audio signals to get there was nothing okay
so we're relying on your matlab script to get us the chopped version of the audio right
uh well the well the matlab script uh bas just sa uh just says uh yeah
gi gi gives you the times of the audio beep in the s in the signal
right so we can either adjust the eye trai track data or we can actually chop the audio signal to take off the first whatever however many seconds
so i just
oh okay
yeah
right
so we there's gonna be a way to sooner or later to align the eye track camtasia one camtasia two with two sound channels
yeah
yeah
but uh but d um the uh lining up the camtasia two is gonna take we w he's working on a matlab script for the sound but not for so the one that's got the sound on it
right
that'll also tell you where to chop the video to get it to line up
mm-hmm
the one that doesn't have the sound on it it won't
ah the bleep we'll find
oh
so it's just got the bleeps
oh yeah
oh okay so w no hand synchronization required at all
um as long as the scripts work right
yeah
'kay
how confident are you about the finding these things
pretty confident
but you you've you've seen them
mm
it it was it was
so we just have to w hope we don't have an any subjects with the odd vocalizations
right
yeah
yeah i don't see him with ten he kilohertz
right
right
they uh they also tend to have a funny funny shape beeps
so
yeah
yeah
okay
mm-hmm
yeah
'cause this this is the drop out test
mm-hmm
yep
okay
yeah is there an end signal
when you decide it's all over does it ping you back and
yeah the the the there's a signal at the start and the end of every trial
yeah yeah
right
okay
so
so when you've when you've pressed we're finished it pings back at you
yep
yep
okay
it's just that all kinds of crazy things happen when you're running things
and so up saving a percentage of a trial is sometimes a good i you know being able to do that is sometimes a good idea
mm
okay
oh yeah
yes it's a stereo jack
it's a stereo jack
i know but so you g you got a solution for that then
but it's a mono but it's a mono uh microphone
mono mono recording on microphones
line in
uh sp going going through a line in
oh right okay
so it's a so it's a lit so it's quieter because it's not as though it's not powered
yeah
but it's still think yeah
we we still pick up a signal
can w
you're sure there's not a better solution that involves
yeah can we do can we do something better than that
like having
'cause you know people might wanna use this for speech recognition or something
yeah
you never know if it's the data is there then
yeah i mean it's it's crazy
we're in an anechoic room which we specially yeah built an anechoic
you know
but you know sound room which we specially built for this
yeah
and you're gonna want forced alignment
we're d in good circumstances
we shouldn't screw it up more than we have to
is there anything we can do to improve this
yeah
oh no
yeah
well no no
no
no no
better to collect and sort
do you have a powered microphone or something
well the the when they are they are the the they have batteries in them
uh well it's the mono
but i there's not doesn't
but doesn't seem to be powered because the because the line in input's so low
wait wait w i i thought the sol that a better solution was fixing this problem with the mono microphone socket
right
sound card
so you said the problem was the m it the m m i is expecting a mono microphone input
the so the sound the sound the s
that the line is stereo the input is mono
right
is that what you said
well the yeah the the yeah the the the the jack that is that it's plugged into is stereo
right
is ah
but when you plug in when it's recording from microphone it records in mono
so is that fixable
like is there any way yeah
that's somewhere in the sound card
and yeah
a new sound card is fixable
uh i think a new sound card sounds a better solution than monkeying about with trying to filter white noise out
yeah
als think we we have a well i suppo i suppose it well one th one thing you do is uh re is record the sou speech signal separately for each for each person
but then you'd have to pull the two pull the two sounds together
which isn't hard
yep
but hi but it's only got one input right
so if uh so if i i if each machine recorded its own with a recorded the recorded like the the p th the uh the user on that one
its own track its own video
you have to align the videos anyway right
yeah
i
i believe it's easy to put two monos into a stereo signal
yeah
oh they yeah
and then the so the yeah
so th
yeah it's easy
yeah
easy
well i'm not the technical person who would do it
so
if if nothing if nothing else you h uh if nothing else you can do it in a matlab script
but i know who to ask
you just write read read file one read file two
mm-hmm
yeah yeah
mm-hmm
and then you just yeah
so is there any reason why we wou don't do that
yeah but then the the the matlab the matlab script will tell you how l it will tell you how far apart they are
but it's the same as
'cause you can do you can just measure the drift between the two of them
'cause you got a l you got a list of where the where the beeps are
and then you say right this stream is like i don't know nought point two five seconds behind the other one
mm-hmm
says robin thinking about cutting and splicing yeah
yeah
yeah okay
well
it's in the old days we probably would have want a little if they'd been in the same room we would have had a little stereo thing in the background as backup as well just to make sure
mm-hmm
mm-hmm
'cause it's slightly dicier you know if his scripts don't work then you don't get the overlap
yeah i wanna see several of them
i wanna see i wanna see one of them um look really nice before we start running subjects
can we do that
it doesn't have to be a real trial
yeah
it just has to be two guys talking in the two bits
yes that's right
and then
i just wanna know it works the way you expect it to work
this is not a a gesture of mistrust
this is just experience that um if anything can screw up it will
yeah
we've both been so badly bitten in the past
i i'm trying to choose my language carefully because we're being recorded
but you'll hear more choice language at the point when we've all done a lot of work and and then we discover we can't use the session because of some thing we didn't think about
mm-hmm
yeah
right
yeah
but this this sounds reasonable to me
so then
um
i so i think
mm-hmm
mm-hmm
mm-hmm
yeah
right
and then then we combine
do do they both have the same sound card problem
i wouldn't count on it
they've both got the same sound card
okay
so yeah
yeah
yeah
yeah
'cause 'cause 'cause
it's probably worth mentioning this to the to the guys in the garage in toronto right
to say mm-hmm
yes
mm-hmm
mm-hmm
yeah
so the the external version's got plugs that size and that that is stereo microphones
mm-hmm
uh-huh
right
but yeah
the other one's plug's like the smaller size and that isn't stereo
so the colour the colour can do it
oh
it's just that the connectors on the the connectors at the back of the computer can't
well uh yeah
i think tell the guys
i think that's a if the documentation said it w could record in stereo then i think we should talk to them about how they've done this
is you're not sure from the documentation what it says it can do
to yeah yeah
mm-hmm
yeah
but as as far far as we can and find the the web site of the yeah the the creative labs web site and the review of it
um and they weren't entirely clear
but they both suggested that it is there is a mono that there there is a mono microphone
yeah
mm-hmm
yeah
yeah it's just the way they wired it
so um it's getting late and i've got a two o'clock and i've got a nice lunch
right
okay
so i wanna eat my lunch today
uh what did you wanna get through today more
okay
i mean i think i think it was useful going through your expectations about this
mm-hmm
'cause um that's quite a bit clearer in my head at least and but i think mostly we leave you to go away and re design the g. d. f. or add new bits to the g. d. f. along these lines
yeah i'm
yeah
so and basically out the output the g. d. f. is just gonna be a whole series of events you know with start and end time
and then w
yeah
right
and the event's gonna have whatever all whatever the object uh is that's being looked at and things
right
okay
um and then yeah and then it's a matter of we're gonna put whatever filters you need after that
so you can say right
right
i just want so you can say from the time where they picked up triangle one to the part time it became part of the assembly
find out how it's how m percentages of time they were looking at it or whatever
right
right
okay so when you i mean uh given that there are these events recorded
we can use any of them as the beginning of any of them as a start point for example right
um there are also motions being recorded of objects
yep
so yeah
right
so you got mo yeah
yeah yeah yeah
there there's move events
there's look events
there's fixations and blinks now at the moment as well
mm-hmm
right
um and yeah and oh yeah and see uh looks at looks at objects and looks whatever else
mm-hmm
so um s
okay
but i think the thing to do is um for you to go away and think about it this way with the different tracks for the different objects and the um the kinds of things we've added about whether they're looking at the other person's gaze and what have you
and and try to change the spec so it it reflects this and maybe um oh maybe by that point there will be some sample data or something uh and the right thing to do is for us to look at the sp the spec the way you understand it now and some data
yep
yep
and then ellen'll have new ideas about what's needed or about these post analyses you know the and then and we can add 'em in
right
yeah
yeah
yeah i will
so i'm right
but it's gonna emerge over time
i mean that's clear
uh that that that's great
i i'd before we break up for lunch i just wanna make sure that tha that i know how long it's gonna be before we're in run mode okay
so the sound thing the sound thing is stands in our way we need to be recording sound online
oh so the spec to the other conversation yeah
okay
so that's a thing that has to be solved
the shape thing is solved
yeah that's that's solved now
mm-hmm
we think
yeah test
we believe
we have to test
right
so that's that that that should be done this week
yep
um in fact like tomorrow for example
um the shape all the shape problems are solved
generating shapes no problem
um scoring shape overlap no problem
nothing is problem there
there are no visual display problems
well you don't have your models or do you
mm-hmm
yeah they had their
they had their inspection last week
um j. p. staggered away from it and
ah
yeah
yeah
well uh anything you actually need fixed
mm-hmm
you know
yep
okay
s
joe doesn't live here anymore right
so
well i but he wasn't gonna be booking any time to us after the thirty first of october
so um
that that means that any bugs that need fixed are now craig's responsibility right
you don't know have any change on that right
okay
fair enough
um i haven't i haven't had any discussions with him since
'cause he that's what he said to us originally
so i would assume you know no more contact with joe
it's not fair to get work out of somebody for free
so you know ask craig instead
okay
well he's ph he's physically here
yeah
if we want to pay him for some more time we can do that
would that be a just better use of our time in get
i don't think
yeah
well w he wasn't paid in advance
he's being paid in arrears
so it doesn't matter
right
uh i think it's
but m he he he is around and i believe
and if if the if i if it's a
i think it's better to have all the software
i mean it's not big things it's just maintenance at this program at this point and
right
but if um if everybody has a lot to do and you know
joe could give it a couple of hours which i is what it might take just to fix it
then let's do it because starting run time is now getting to be fairly urgent
yeah
i if he can give it you know like because the problem is you gotta have an immediately when you discover a bug in that
mm-hmm
and we can make craig shift all his other priorities to do this 'cause we bought him
mm-hmm
right
right
right
but we can't we can't make joe do this ec alright
yeah
so it's a kinder way
so there's uh some trade off between availability and speed from start to finish given that this is somebody else's code
it yeah
yeah
so you know
but it sounds like you don't think there's anything that actually needs fixed at the moment
well yeah
yeah
because w we only need this to work well enough that you can use it for something and you got work rats
right so we're we're b we're building models
so
right
we're we um
and how many models do you need to completion
and how long does that take
we have the design somewhere
and you got
mm
hmm
well
and you know about complexity
you're waiting on marloes
mm-hmm
okay
you can cold call her today this afternoon
yeah
i think so
'cause um i have to check back with
with j. p. fairly soon
okay he wanted to kn um
the eighteen the next eighteen month plan great
deliverables great
progress with the experiment well that's what we're doing now
okay
so what do we think if you have a fairly hectic week are we looking for subjects next week
okay
ads go up
yeah i do
i do
but i think ad should probably go up this week
we want people for n for next week
mm-hmm
is that okay
is anybody now terrified at the thought that we're live next week
there are people coming in here one after another
or p two two after two more likely
that's her job
yeah
yeah
okay is the is this is this generalised is this generalised anxiety robin
come on
or do you have a specific thing that okay
yeah
so aside from the usual angst which we all suffer when we go live
so we w we wanna do some piloting at the end of the week
yep
right
yeah
so we'll we'll get we'll get the get the audio stuff tested you know single microphones
um yeah
get that tested next couple days and i assu i assume that's not something you need me for t in terms of that
okay
right
s
right
oh yeah
she's using but she's actually relaxed that somewhat
okay
yeah
mm-hmm
mm-hmm
ostensibly booked time which isn't
so you can dash in there for half an hour at a time
doesn't sound very useful for you
uh-huh
okay well
okay
we've but we have we have a solid booking for all the mornings anyway
you guys sort it out
right
and l except by permission of us alright
we own it
mm-hmm
um so we can change that
i mean they everybody acknowledged the the other week that we that we had priority
right but it would be kind to tell her ahead of time which of your morning sessions you're bumped
oh yeah
yeah yeah yeah
oh yeah yeah
yeah
oh yeah yeah
don't worry
um there's there's a booking system right
so it's public what's booked and what isn't
mm-hmm
i thought that was the problem that your mornings weren't sliced off on the booking system
okay
no
alright maybe w should get on there and book mornings as far as the eye can see
alright
uh-huh
'cause you know i if you're sa told use the booking system
yeah just a well we think we spoke to all the people who who used those facilities the other day
but we could be wrong
so
huh
yeah
right
and what are the instr what are the people upstairs downstairs have um i you know as rules about who you hand the keys to
um well the two key holders are here
'cause you know we like people to know to ground the oh i thought the the lending for the booking system caroline
oh i see
from caroline
or the general office
the general office
see 'cause you're supposed to uh have training in
i see
but no they need a they need an account on this machine to actually to use it
they need account on these machines so that they could book
oh okay so that's the safety
they couldn't actually log in
and you control those accounts
mm-hmm
oh okay that's fair enough
okay
okay
we're also working on a way of making sure that the matin that the machines return to zero state when they're when you come off them
uh-huh yeah
that's safer
because the it's the people have been leaving var um well people have been leaving various bits of who knows what around on them
'cause then they learn the first time
right which which we think is what's critical
yeah yeah
okay
i really have to get out of here
okay
so um what else is important before you run
um piloting piloting piloting
nothing right
you have we have to build the things
you got uh willing heads
we have to try the machi th things
we have to check them with marloes and j. p. that they like the representation the variables right
how about uh you have any time on friday
oh i don't think i brought my diary up
uh but maybe
i get a email back
why
maybe you and i should be the pilot subjects
first pilot subjects the ones who um know which questions we wanna ask
and then we should get another pair who are naive to the whole thing
okay
so
okay
yeah
mm-hmm
this is generalised floating anxiety
no no
it's it's it's wisdom
but yeah
well um because actually we can i mean uh you know if we make comments they feed back in a lo into the development
hmm
so do you know what time of day you might want
'cause i should c i should check that
okay
you don't you don't need me involved in the pilot do you
so well unle unless unless it's a bug report yeah
you all have to b you'll have to be there to when it falls over
i'll w yeah w i'll i'll i'll b i'll be around
but yeah i'll make sure
but ho hopefully it will run smoothly and yeah i can relax
yeah
so
okay
so that all sounds f good fun
well i can just leave you guys here you know
why not
okay
right
um well this is the kick off meeting for our our project
um and um this is just what we're gonna be doing over the next twenty five minutes
mm-hmm
um so first of all just to kind of make sure that we all know each other i'm laura and i'm the project manager
do you want to introduce yourself again
great
hi i'm david and i'm supposed to be an industrial designer
okay
and i'm andrew and i'm uh our marketing
um i'm craig and i'm user interface
expert
great
okay
um so we're designing a new remote control and um oh i have to record who's here actually
so that's david andrew and craig isn't it
and you all arrived on time
um yeah so des uh design a new remote control
um as you can see it's supposed to be original trendy and user friendly
um so that's kind of our our brief as it were
um and so there are three different stages to the design
um i'm not really sure what what you guys have already received um in your emails
what did you get
um i just got the project announcement about what the project is
mm-hmm
designing a remote control
mm-hmm
that's about it didn't get anything else
mm-hmm
yeah that's that's it
is that what everybody got
yeah
did you get the same thing
okay
yeah
um
so we're gonna have like individual work and then a meeting about it
and repeat that process three times
um and at this point we get try out the whiteboard over there
um
so uh you get to draw your favourite animal and sum up your favourite characteristics of it
so who would like to go first
i will go
that's fine
very good
alright
so
this one here right
mm-hmm
okay
very nice
alright
my favourite animal
is like
a beagle
um charac favourite characteristics of it
is that right
yeah
uh right well basically um high priority for any animal for me is that they be willing to take a lot of physical affection from their family
yeah
and yeah that they have lots of personality and uh be fit and in robust good health
so this is blue
blue beagle
my family's beagle
right
lovely
well my favourite animal would be a monkey
then they're small cute and furry and uh when planet of the apes becomes real i'm gonna be up there with them
right
cool
there's too much gear
you can take as long over this as you like because we haven't got an awful lot to discuss
ok oh we do we do
don't feel like you're in a rush anyway
okay
i coulda told you a whole lot more about beagles
ach why not we might have to get you up again then
boy let me tell you
i don't know what mine is
i'm gonna have to think on the spot now
impressionist
can't draw
is that a whale
um
yeah
um well anyway i don't know it's just the first animal i can think off the top of my head
um
yes
big reason is 'cause i'm allergic to most animals
allergic to animal fur so um fish was a natural choice
ah
um yeah and i kind of like whales
they come in and go eat everything in sight
alright
and they're quite harmless and mild and interesting
mm
okay
god i still don't know what i'm gonna write about
um
superb sketch by the way
tail's a bit big i think
i was gonna choose a dog as well
but i'll just draw a different kind of dog
yep
m my favourite animal is my own dog at home
um
that doesn't really look like him actually
he looks more like a pig actually
ah well
i see a dog in there
do you
yep
oh that's very good of you
now i see a rooster
uh
what kind is it
um he's a mixture of uh various things
um and what do i like about him um that's just to suggest that his tail wags
um he's very friendly and cheery and always pleased to see you and very kind of affectionate and um
uh and he's quite quite wee as well so you know he can doesn't take up too much space
um
and uh and he does a funny thing where he chases his tail as well which is quite amusing so
is he aware that th it's his own cha tail he's chasing
it is
i think it is
he only does it after he's had his dinner and um he'll just all of a sudden just get up and start chasing his tail 'round the living room
hmm
it's an after dinner dog then
yeah so uh
probably when he was little he got lots of attention for doing it and has forever been conditioned
yeah maybe
maybe
right um where did you find this
just down here
yeah
okay
um what are we doing next
uh um
okay uh we now need to discuss the project finance
um
so according to the brief um we're gonna be selling this remote control for twenty five euro um and we're aiming to make fifty million euro
um so we're gonna be selling this on an international scale
and uh we don't want it to cost any more than uh twelve fifty euros so fifty percent of the selling price
'kay
um can we just go over that again
sure
uh so bas at twel alright yeah
okay
so cost like production cost is twelve fifty but selling price is is that wholesale or retail
all together
like on the shelf
um i dunno
i imagine that's a good question
our sale our sale anyway
i imagine it probably is our sale actually because it's probably up to the
yeah okay okay
the um the retailer to uh sell it for whatever price they want
okay
mm-hmm
um
alright
but i i don't know
i mean do you think the fact that it's going to be sold internationally will have a bearing on how we design it at all
yes
think it will
mm-hmm
um
mm-hmm
hmm
well right away i'm wondering if there's um th th uh like with d. v. d. players if there are zones
oh yeah regions and stuff yeah
um f frequencies or something um as well as uh characters um different uh keypad styles and s symbols
yeah
okay
hmm
yeah
well for a remote control do you think that will be i suppose it's depends on how complicated our remote control is
um
i don't know
yeah
it does make sense from maybe the design point of view 'cause you have more complicated characters like european languages then you need more buttons
yeah yeah
yeah
so possibly
yeah
okay
and then a and then al the other thing international is on top of the price
i'm thinking
the price might might appeal to a certain market in one region whereas in another it'll be different so
what just like in terms of like the wealth of the country
just a chara just a characteristic of the
like how much money people have to spend on things like
just
or just like basic product podi positioning the twenty five euro remote control might be a big hit in london
might not be such a big hit in greece who knows something like that yeah
aye i see what you mean yeah
marketing
good marketing thoughts
yep
oh gosh i should be writing all this down
um
right away i'm making some kind of assumptions about what what information we're given here thinking
mm
'kay trendy probably means something other than just basic something other than just standard
yeah
um
so i'm wondering right away is selling twenty five euros is that sort of the thi is this gonna to be like the premium product kinda thing or
yeah yeah
like how much does you know a remote control cost
uh-huh
well twenty five euro i mean that's um
that's about like eighteen pounds or something isn't it
mm-hmm
or no is it as much as that
sixteen seventeen eighteen pounds
yep
yeah i'd say so yeah
um i dunno i've never bought a remote control so i don't know how how good a remote control that would get you
no
yeah yeah
um
but yeah i suppose it has to look kind of cool and gimmicky
mm-hmm
um right okay
let me just scoot on ahead here
okay
um well d does anybody have anything to add to uh to the finance issue at all
do we have any other background information on like how that compares to other
thin
no actually
that would be useful though wouldn't it if you knew like what your money would get you now
other
yeah
hmm
mm-hmm
mm-hmm
yeah interesting thing about discussing um production of a remote control for me is that l as you point out
i just don't think of remote controls as somethin something people consciously assess in their purchasing habits
yeah yeah
it's just like getting shoelaces with shoes or something
oh
it just comes along
five minutes to end of meeting
oh okay
we're a bit behind
do you know what i mean
yeah
like so sort of like how do you i i mean one one way of looking at it would be
yeah
well the people producing television sets maybe they have to buy remote controls
or another way is maybe people who have t. v. sets are really fed up with their remote control and they really want a better one or something
i know um
my parents went out and bought um remote controls because um they got fed up of having four or five different remote controls for each things the house
but
right
right
so um for them it was just how many devices control
okay so
right so in function one of the priorities might be to combine as many uses
yeah
right so do you think that should be like a main design aim of our remote control d you know
i think so
do your your satellite and your regular telly and your v. c. r. and everything
yeah yeah
yeah
well like um maybe what we could use is a sort of like a example of a successful other piece technology is palm palm pilots
they're gone from being just like little sort of scribble boards to cameras m. p. three players telephones
mm-hmm
everything agenda
so like i wonder if we might add something new to the to the remote control market such as the lighting in your house or um
yeah
or even like you know notes about um what you wanna watch
like you might put in there oh i want to watch such and such and look a oh that's a good idea
yeah yeah
an
so extra functionalities
yeah
like p personally for me at home i've i've combined the um the audio video of my television set and my d. v. d. player and my c. d. player
so they w all work actually function together but i have different remote controls for each of them
mm-hmm
so it's sort of ironic that that then they're in there
um
you know the sound and everything it's just one system
but each one's got its own little
hmm
part
um okay uh i'd wel we're gonna have to wrap up pretty quickly in the next couple of minutes
um i'll just check we've nothing else
okay
um so anything else anybody wants to add about what they don't like about remote controls they've used
what they would really like to be part of this new one at all
and you keep losing them
you keep losing them
mm
okay
finding them is really a pain you know
mm
i mean it's usually quite small or when you want it right it slipped behind the couch or it's kicked under the table
mm
mm-hmm
mm-hmm
yeah
yeah
w you get those ones where you can if you like whistle or make a really high pitched noise they beep
yeah
you know
that's just really good id
yep
there i mean is that something we'd want to include do you think
uh sure
dunno
okay maybe
i remember when the first remote control my my family had was on a cable
actually had a cable between it and the t. v. and big like buttons that sort of like like on a blender or something
my goodness
and um you know when i think about what they are now it's better but actually it's still kind of
i dunno like a massive junky thing on the table
still feels quite primitive
maybe we could think about how could be more you know streamlined
maybe like a touch screen or something
s
something like that yeah
okay
or whatever would be technologically reasonable
uh-huh okay
well i guess that's up to our industrial designer
'cause it could b it could it could be that f it could be that functionally that doesn't make it any better
but that just the appeal of of not having you know
it looks better
these days there's a r pe things in people's homes are becoming more and more like chic you know
yeah
um nicer materials and might be
okay
okay
be worth exploring anyway
uh
right well um so just to wrap up the next meeting's gonna be in thirty minutes
so that's about um about ten to twelve by my watch
um so inbetween now and then um as the industrial designer
you're gonna be working on you know the actual working design of it so y you know what you're doing there
yep
um for user interface technical functions i guess that's you know like what we've been talking about what it'll actually do
um and uh marketing executive
you'll be just thinking about what it actually what you know
what requirements it has to has to fulfil and you'll all get instructions emailed to you i guess
okay
um
yeah so it's th the functional design stage is next i guess
and uh
and that's the end of the meeting
so i got that little message a lot sooner than i thought i would so
um
before we wrap up just to make sure we're all on the same page here um
mm-hmm
do we we were given sort of an example of a coffee machine or something right
uh-huh yeah
mm-hmm
well
um
are we at ma right now on the assumption that our television remote control may have features which go beyond the television
or are we keeping sort of like a a design commitment to television features
th
okay well just very quickly 'cause this we're supposed to finish now
i i don't know
yep
um i guess that's up to us i mean you probably want some kind of unique selling point of it so um you know
yeah sure
okay
i think one factor would be production cost
okay yeah
because there's a cap there so um depends on how much you can cram into that price
yeah
okay
mm-hmm
okay
um
yeah
i think that that's the main factor
okay
okay
right okay we'll that's that's the end of the meeting then
alright
um
so uh
thank you all for coming
cool
is that alright now
okay
sorry
okay everybody all set to start the meeting
okay we've got half an hour for this one um to uh discuss the um functional design
could you plug me in
okay
thanks
all ready to go
okay
okay
um so hopefully you've all been working away and i've put the minutes of the last meeting in the project folder
um so i guess just to to recap on uh what we did last time
um kind of uh got to know each other a little bit and uh got familiar with all the equipment and started to discuss um a bit about the project
you know cost wise how much how much money we had to s
um just want to tell you that you have three new requirements
um which is the the first one is that um uh the company's decided that teletext is outdated uh because of how popular the internet is
nobody uses teletext very much anymore so we don't really need to consider that in the functionality of the of the remote control
'kay
um they've also suggested that we um we only use the remote control to control the television not the v. c. r. d. v. d. or anything else
i think the worry is that if the project becomes too complex then it'll affect um how long it takes us to get it into into production
the time to market
okay
so um we're just gonna keep it simple and it'll just control the t. v.
and the other thing was that the company want the corporate colour and slogan to be implemented in the new design
um i'm not entirely sure what the corporate colour is
it might be yellow because there seems to be a lot of yellow everywhere
and the slogan like the actual written slogan or just to embody the idea of the slogan
well that's the thing i'm i'm not sure um
uh th because on the the company website uh what does it say
'bout putting the fashion in electronics
uh something
yeah i mean do they is that something they want actually written on it 'cause it's quite long
mm yeah
um or yeah just the idea but i'm not sure
so that's something we can discuss as well
so those are the three things just not to worry about teletext uh only control the t. v.
and um and uh incorporate the uh colour and slogan of the company
um so is everybody okay with any of that or do you want me to recap at all
nope we're all set
right um time for presentations then
who would like to go first
i'll go first
sure
okay cool
alright um can i st steal this from the back of your laptop
oh yeah of course yeah
uh
g go on ahead
so this is the technical functions design
um
right to do the um the design i have i've had a look online
i've had a look at the homepage which has given us um some insp inspiration from previous products
mm-hmm
um i've had a look at the previous products to see what they offer and um i would like to ask you guys for um your ideas about the design at the end of the meeting
um unfortunately we're not allowed to talk outside the meeting room so
okay
right
um having a look at the existing products i found out that um it tends to come in sort of two extremes
there's either um a very complicated one that's got lots of buttons lots of colours very confusing you don't know what you're doing
um in that case the the labelling tends to be very bad
um there's an example i'll show you at the end um sh show you now
uh
here um the button there and there
alright
this one's prog
sorry
that one's perg and that one's prog and it doesn't really tell you what it does
um not sure if you had a a look at the other um control in that example
um it's a very simple one
it's got only the basic functions mm but um it's the same size as the the hard to use one
oop
uh it looked a bit clunky
they're very big and not very much use for buttons
um and it's just very hard to access the advanced functions
there's there's nothing for instance for a slow motion button
um my own preferences i prefer the the clunky one
um it's very easy to use
um but unfortunately it does lack the advanced functions which i i quite like having on the controls
um so i believe the the advanced functions should maybe be hidden in a drawer or something like tha from the bottom of it
so now i'd like to ask for your preferences
um not sure of how long we've got uh
um
well we can chat away for uh for five minutes or so i think at at most
mm-hmm
just a couple of minutes anyway
m yeah
like a lot of a lot of what i've um read and prepared for this meeting fits in really closely with what with what craig's just gone over
so in part i could i could give you some of my personal preferences but i could also th add some to this which is just about sort of um sort of market research
mm-hmm
but anyway um we might come to that later
shall we sh well we'll stick to kind of your area for now
which which is the clunky one the one on left or on the right
um the clunky one is the one on the right
okay
yeah
um clunky in what sense like um h heavier
larger
um i think it's supposed to be the same size but um it's got much fewer buttons
it's you know it's very spread out and kind of you know i get the idea it'd be sort of about this size
i see so it's more just basic
looks kind of yeah
right okay
yeah
got very few buttons on it and
yeah
sure
well i think it's a valid point
i mean like the one on the left looks quite um quite complicated and that p. r. t. p p. r. o. t. thing is incredibly confusing
um so i see i see why yo you know you might prefer the simpler design but yeah you don't want to lose out on
you know what it does so maybe you know you know you get a lot of remote controls where you kind of flip the thing open
mm-hmm
i think that's a good idea
mm-hmm
i think it's a good idea
mm-hmm
mm-hmm
um do we have any functions that um we'd want on it
i mean so far i've got um on and off um switch the channel up and down and put the volume up and down
mm-hmm
uh-huh
um they're just the the very basics you could use for a t. v.
uh-huh and then actual numbers for channels as well yeah
okay
um you say that's a h a required one or a requested one
which was that
would you like um the channels like the the numbers on thing um
up the numbers or the up down
god i wou i would say that's required
i mean there's no way anybody's gonna buy a remote control these days when if you can't actually individually select channels i mean would anybody disagree with that
yeah
yeah
um what else uh so don't need to worry about teletext don't need to worry about v. c. r.
uh any kind of like display controls at all do you think we need to worry about you know like brightness and contrast
we don't
no
yeah
well i think i think es essentially what we're doing right now is we're categorising
we're saying well we want this to be a product that offers all the sort of more tricky features but we want them to be in another area
mm
is that right
is that what we're we're doing
yeah
um yeah
we're kind of like sorting them an or are we actually eliminating things we just don't want the product to have
um
i think are you are you maybe kind of thinking what we absolutely have to have and what would be nice
uh to start with um sort of a bit both
um we need to find out exactly what we have to have um and after that we can add things if they're possible
mm-hmm
okay right
well do you wanna maybe just at this point decide on what we absolutely must have as a p as a function of this
yeah
yep
um so so far just to recap you've got volume and channel control and
there's um on and off um volume and channel and skip to certain channels with the numbers
right okay
um
well one one way i would look at this um would be that we a approach the different controls in terms of um like control types
so that for the user it's very clear what they want to do where they go
mm-hmm yeah
uh and also think maybe a little bit about sorta w w what would just wanna be acc easily accessible
for example if we had audio controls those could be something people set up very rarely
oka
maybe they're un they're they're they're in a little area but covered up um things like channel and volume um are used all the time
mm-hmm
so we just have them right out on top um very just very sort of self explanatory
um so maybe we need to think about having three or more groupings of controls
you know like one which are just the the habitual ones that should be right within your natural grip
and others that are uh also available and then others that are concealed
something like that
okay
uh well just to to wrap up quickly on this this little section have i just lost oh no
um uh do you think maybe that's the only kind of uh essential requirements
and then maybe just things that would be nice if it could do would be things like audio set up and display set up and things like that
maybe like a mute button that sort of thing
yeah
any of you anything to add to that at all
no
no
i'll add it later i guess the presentation
okay right
mm-hmm
yeah
um okay if we can move on to next presentation then please
sure
um
do you want to switch places
do you wanna
can this can this pl reach
can this plug come across
no
probably not actually
no
no
so why don't i just pick up and move then
yeah
here i'll just
why don't i just
mm er can you go up behind me
just just switch them
kinda this is so this i'm all in a knot now
bit complicated
it'd be nice if everything was wireless wouldn't it
okay
right
um
so i can i can say already
i dunno whether this is for good or for bad but there'll be a lot of kind of uh redundancy in the in the the issues and the the uh the things
oh like overlap between what you said
yeah yeah
oh well for all you know that that'll happen
which is ma not necessarily a bad thing
but may what i've already started doing is cr i created a slide in in my presentation here so um so that we kind of think well what's the cumulative effect of what we've taken from your ideas and and mine
because certainly i i have a hard time separating separating things completely
obviously obviously what you've just told me what you've just told me impacts a lot on what um like market research mm that that i've been so how do i how do i get this up
mm hard to know what where your role ends yeah
okay
um function f. eight
uh pr yeah press function and f. eight yeah
okay
okay
alright
so
f. eight
function the blue button
next to the control on the left
oh and f. eight
yeah
mm
you have to push it together
okay
mm-hmm
yep
okay i think that that's doing it now
nope
try that again
uh again
think maybe the the wire in the back might be loose
wait
okay
yeah you wanna
um okay great
oh oh here we go
yep there we go
there you go
okay
just um before i bring this up what i'll just say is um what i've what i've done is tried to collect some information so that i can then relay this to to you guys so that it's now becomes a collective thing
and then kind of lead us in the direction of deciding 'kay what what are our options
what should we decide and do you know what i mean so
increase that 'cause we can't see the
um
okay
okay
that's much better
right
can you um
there you go
right okay
okay
alright
that would be
okay
so um does that make sense
so what i basically got is i just looked into some information and sort of th tried to think about how how we could review it and how we could and what kind of decisions we could take away from it and then maybe by the end of just looking at some of these things we can think about what are our priorities
'cause certainly there's lots of different information to go through
so um i'm thinking here about uh primarily about customer needs that we start with the customer
and w you know what they want and what are issues with with um existing products
uh to think about trends and also about try and connect that as you see with the company vision which is about fashion in electronics
um and then as i say uh w we'd like to prioritise our design features from this and um
bouncing on top
dunno
okay
yeah
um
so this is what i've found here um a lot of this is new to me so we'll just read through together
um users dislike the look and feel of current remote controls
so they find them ugly
most people find them ugly
um the vast majority would spend more money for it to look fancy as well we'll see later
the vast majority would spend more money for um slightly more intuitive control such as voice recognition
mm-hmm
okay i'm gonna we'll look at that in a second
um most people use only a f a very slim portion of all the controls
so i guess what we're looking at here is people want this h technology
they tend to use the most simple controls and overall they find remote controls to be something they don't doesn't really appeal to them
mm-hmm
so i think what we're doing is we're trying to take like if for me this is sorta like three different different um inspirations
you know one is that we want uh something that's high tech but we want it to seem easy
and in spite of the primitive side of it and the very high tech side we want it to just be an appealing piece of equipment in people's hands
um frustrations
they get lost a lot s as it came up in our last meeting
um takes time to learn how to use them
this is uh why i mention when craig was uh showing us some ideas that we actually try and group controls
so d it doesn't just look like a big panel kinda like when you you look at
you know a new computer keyboard or something that is quite explanatory
if you want audio if you want visual then you have those
um
and i will admit i don't know what r. s. i. stands for
repetitive strain injury
is installing a new remote control something that people
uh no that did not come up at all
um so here here is another um sort of a a review here of the main things
i also found that most people would uh adults at least would pay more for voice recognition
now apparently we do have access to all the tech cutting edge technology in remote control
so i dunno if that's possible we might consider getting into it
um
and and again here as we sort of move m sort of thin start thinking about how we wanna sell and market this
i think a recurring theme here is the company wants it to be wants us to make something that's fashionable and sleek and trendy
mm-hmm
um people uh additionally aren't aren't liking the appearance of their products
so we wanna think about as we take all the sort of the techie features how we can um put that into a unit which is which people like
you know they like the aesthetics and the ergonomics
okay
so want something that looks good and is easy to use big priorities
yeah
yeah
okay
so you know just c looking at what what craig um craig's i uh ideas are s sorta tell me that maybe what we wanna do is try and um separate the different things that we wanna include in this
so if we do say well we want there to be all the technology will we try and make that almost be like optional technology
you know it's like like i find a lot of t. v. s these days
something really like about 'em is if you wanna just turn 'em on and off you can
but they have little panels where you click and there's just like tons of features you go through
mm
so it you wanna group all the different kind of types of functions together you know
yeah
that's i think it's a good idea
yeah
that's s that's sort of the um but i i'm my hope here is that i'm putting out this information so that we can then say okay
well how do we collectively move on with it
mm-hmm
um i i haven't brought out one specific marketing idea
okay
although my sense is that what we should try and think about is what are the current trends in materials and shapes and styles and then use that
mm-hmm
but not let that confine us technologically
okay
so
right
alright
any um comments on all of that
well um one of the things that we have to decide on by the end of the meeting is who we're gonna be um who's our our target audience
that's uh
our target market
yeah
um so if we want something that that looks good and is easy to use
but has y is fairly powerful product whatever who do we really want to aim that at
okay
i mean
where's the money maybe
yeah who wou who would have the money to spend
yeah
well i if if like twenty five euro is our is our selling price then you can imagine
and who watches t. v.
mm-hmm
well i don't i'm not really sure how much that will retail at
mm
but you want it's somebody who's not gonna just use the remote that comes with their telly i suppose they're gonna actually go out and buy one
mm-hmm
yeah
so who do you think we're aiming this at
um i think it'll be the mid range to the high end market in terms of people
'cause twenty five euros for a remote how much is that lo locally in pounds
it's about sixteen seventeen pounds i think
is that too is that a lot of money to buy an extra remote or a replacement remote
yeah okay
mm-hmm
right
um so maybe not the high end range but maybe middle middle up ish
okay
kind of
you know how much
i dunno i guess you pay what ten ten quid for a remote
okay
like a simple replacement right
yeah
i mean if you lost your remote and the first thing you just wanna go out and get would you how much would you pay
yeah yeah
yeah
this this kinda touches on your comments there david
these are the age groups which we have information on and these are this is a table of h what people would pay more for a certain feature
yeah
just gives us a rough idea of where the w the will to spend money on t. v. equipment is
okay
okay
mostly focused around the twenty five age group
yeah so do you think we're we're aiming at a fairly young market then
yep
sort of young professional kind of
yeah okay
mm-hmm
um
um do you think then uh voice recognition is something we should really seriously consider
what what do you think craig
well did you not say it was the the adults that were going for the the voice recognition
sort of the the older group
uh yeah it's the
yep
uh f
it does it does fit with the market that we're sort of identifying in terms of
n yeah
i think we are gonna have to narrow it down to say let's target these people and give them what they want and 'cause you know
okay
yeah
sure
there needs to be some kind of selling point to it
sure
yeah
so um anybody anything there to add just kind of young professionals
uh th like if we are going to include speech recognition it's kind of between fifteen and thirty five seems to be like a really high response to that
mm-hmm
so we could say that was our target
i i think twenty five to thirty five is is is fair to add that in as a group as well because that's more than half your group of people who are willing to at least try and use your technology
yeah
mm-hmm
yeah
yeah yeah
mm-hmm
okay so fifteen to thirty five look fairly young
yeah
yeah
you know they have bit of expendable income to spend on this sort of thing
mm-hmm
i think perhaps that age group is significant as well because those are people who use the computer
mm-hmm
who are familiar with their with computers in in their everyday work
yeah
mm-hmm
i think people who are maybe about i wouldn't say thirty five
mm-hmm
but people who are about forty ish and above now would not be so dependent and reliant on a computer or a mobile phone or something like that
mm-hmm
mm-hmm
but yeah
yeah
yeah sure
so
mm-hmm
so these are people who are gadgety right
people who are u growing up used to you know in schools and in universities
yeah
when you go on to their working lives people who would you know regular yeah
yeah
so they'll not sh not shy away from something quite high tech
yeah
yeah
that that's that's a good point
mm
um okay so um so shall we make the decision uh to include speech recognition if we can
if we can
i i think one thing we should try not to avoid is not to say we have to use speech recognition right now
yeah
yeah
okay
because um based on what you've go y everybody's saying right you want something simple
why is that
you want basic stuff and you want something that's easy to use
speech recognition might not be the simplest thing for somebody to use
right
okay
could it be an on off thing
um but what i'm saying is that we're we're trying to lock ourselves into a s particular kind of technology
like if you want it on yeah
where you can activate it and deactivate it
yeah
yeah
rather than focusing on on exactly what are the features that we're gonna say and then
yeah
okay
you know say speech recognition is good for this speech recognition is not good for this
sure
sure
so maybe we should i suggest that we think about speech recognition anyway it's a it's something that can be used to fulfil a function
okay
yeah
sure
but at end of the day we don't look at the technology but we look at the function first
uh-huh
yeah
okay
sure
yep
uh okay
well do you wanna um give us your presentation and then then we can i don't know um might have been a good idea to all deliver our presentations and then discuss
okay sure
yep
yeah it's good well it's good to get ideas out while they're fresh in mind
but this is this is how we're yeah exactly yeah
um
oh it's something that's just occurred to me as well is if we make it um speech reco if we incorporate speech recognition
that's appealing to people um maybe with a physical disability as well
not
yeah
um
and not losing
and also it helps in terms of people not losing this you know they they're saying oh it's i lose it in the couch
yeah
yeah
like we're kind of what we're b sort of getting in into here is mating different uh design features together that they
mm-hmm
i reckon one problem with speech recognition is um i've actually seen one of them used and uh the technology that was in that one wasn't particularly amazing
so you end up yelling at the control for hours
really
right
channel up
oh really you've seen one before
do you think maybe we need like further advances in that kind of area until it's worthwhile incorporating it though
um
i think it'd probably quite expensive to put in
sorry do you mind passing me my notepad
mm
course not
thanks
cool um
there you go
okay
um
right
well this is just the working design um
mm-hmm
well this is just what how i would go about it
um i guess i try to define like what we're doing now try to define what we're trying to get done
um i think in a practical way we kind of know what it is
right
we've used it we're familiar with it but we're we can't n we haven't narrowed down um exactly what the things we're trying to fulfil
like besides the basics i think back in the back of our minds we know what the basics are
has to change channels has to change volume but in like specifics right which one of the basics are you trying to target
mm-hmm
um are there certain parts of the basics that are more important or less important than the basics
um and i just the idea is just to get everybody to um i usually have a have have a design that's there as a basic
so you know things that to start everything going
but i guess everybody does have some idea so i don't think um there's a need for that
um okay this finding things is a little bit confusing so i'll go into the diagram first
it just explains how the process goes through from a from the basic technology point of view
mm-hmm
the basic steps that you need um in the diagram and in this slide probably works better
um okay you need some power source
'kay a battery or something to keep it going
mm-hmm
um and that power source is important because it ties you down to um how long the device will last
uh-huh
um it ties you down perhaps a bit later on in terms of the technologies um how far you can transmit the signal or the complexity of the functions that you want
mm-hmm
like for example voice recognition right
that might be constrained because that you might need to power a microphone you might need to power other things so that's one perhaps constraint there
um
th okay the basic thing is there's a user interface where people punch a button or talk into it or smile to it or blink their eyes whatever
hmm
you know and that um picks up an input from a user
um uh a logic a series of logic has to decide what the user is telling the device
and the device has to r you know based on you push button a. so i will do something with button a.
so maybe button a. is the power button okay
mm-hmm
mm-hmm
um and then it needs to be able to send the signal out to the device itself which is the receiver here
um and i think that's about it in terms of my design um
it's fairly general um and i guess the purpose of this is also not to restrict you in in the way you're thinking like um voice recognition
mm-hmm
right um if it's something which is important then we just add more power rather than having a thing that we don't have enough power
so it's not really a constraint in that sense but i mean these are functionally you know the base what the technology has to do
okay
mm-hmm
mm-hmm
okay
okay
mm-hmm
um so i guess the rest of it i think we should maybe you you wanna go back to what the functions are
i think that's more relevant to a discussion
'kay
uh
well do you wan do you wanna finish up your your whole presentation then
sure
sure
yeah w i'm done
are you are you all done
more or less
yeah
ps oh it's just putting the rest of it into words but it's essentially the same thing
yep
mm
um you have a transmitter an input device logic chip you know stuff like that
okay
okay
right
um
right
and like on the means b since we're on the topic of the technology uh are there any like what are our options
i guess this would be
yep
alright what's what i in is this the only way that we go about it or are there other thin
um these these aren't technology options in that sense
right
this is just um a basic principles and basic components that are needed
the basic principle of
okay
'kay
right
mm-hmm
for example if you needed um if you needed to add uh a voice recognition right
then your user interface would be split broken down into more components right which you have a microphone the v. r. and stuff like that
okay
mm-hmm
oh
okay
so this just show how we're kind of modularising the whole thing
uh
yep
okay
yep
so each component represents one function but i think the basic functions are the logic the transmitter
mm-hmm
um and the receiver okay and the power are things that you won't have to care about
mm-hmm
mm-hmm
yeah
um and those are things that based on what your user interface requires then we'll add more functionality to it
mm-hmm
okay
um there might be one other consideration which would be that the the transmission between the remote control and the t. v. for example
okay
okay
okay um are we gonna restrict ourselves to using the traditional technologies of infra red thing
okay
because that's something you need to actually be physically be pointing to
okay
right
right
well well a worry that was was expressed in the new requirements was that if we made this too complex it would e it would effect um how long how long it took us to get this to market
so i th suspect it might be a good idea just to restrict our kind of our creative influence on this on the user interface and not worry so much about uh how we transmit it um because i mean it it's tried and tested intra red
yep
so we could stay with tha
there might be one other problem with the transmission um in particular right now since we're talking about voice recognition
um if somebody's gonna h talk to the device you ideally want them to hold it to them
mm-hmm
oh yeah
i it you may not require that but you know um it's it's it's something very natural i guess
right
right
yeah mm-hmm
you know to hold it to signal to the user and push a button maybe to start s talking about it
okay
then you need to send the signal out so because if you're using infra red the line of sight um say the t. v. 's at that chair
mm
mm
and i'm standing in front of here and the transmitter is here it blocks it
yeah
okay
so in that sense there's not really a restriction but it's something which you may have to think about later on in the process
right
okay
not so much further down
okay
and um just a clarification before we finish this
uh does c is our controller is it have the option of being um on a standard uh frequency as all of the other equipment
so that the one controller can control several pieces of equipment
there's there's not much specific specific information but i think that um one indication of infra red mean that you're just targeting traditional devices
w
yeah
okay
because infra red is something which everybody has
w well well we've um in the new requirement spec they said just to focus on the t. v. so that's what we should do for now i think
just to t. v. okay
okay
something i was wondering about was the power
um is it worth considering like having like a charging unit as opposed to just regular batteries
i mean is that something we really want to go into do you think or should we just consider running on regular batteries
there's a there's okay from from a from a component point of view there's added complexity
uh-huh
and you add cost to it um and then there's probably the fact that you need another physical component
uh-huh
you need a docking cradle for example for you to put it in to charge
mm-hmm
yeah
mm-hmm
okay
or you need to get the user to plug it in
um and most users are very f use already used to the idea of buying batteries and putting it into the controller
okay so
yeah
but unless the controller's gonna consume a lot of batteries like he's gonna run through like twenty batteries a month
yeah
then i don't think rechargeable is something we should you know we really need to care about
yeah
okay so just stick to to regular
um
okay
um right
so basically the um i'm just gonna just recap uh what i said at the start
was that um the the whole point of this meeting was to f absolutely finalise who we're gonna aim this at and what exactly the product's gonna do
okay
okay
so um just to recap on are we all happy about the idea of um aiming the product at um the fifteen to thirty five bracket
yeah that's good
um and also the funct the the actual functions of what it's gonna do
do you wanna recap on that craig
um
i think we just say that it was gonna be the the most basic stuff possible
um on off up and down channels up and down volume and uh skip to a channel
okay right
ta
and is it going to include any of the uh the more advanced features or are we gonna eliminate those
um i think we include mute but apart from that um i think we just we'll go for the simpleness
okay
okay
okay i think
r is it is it is it s is it not an option still that we include some things just as a sort of under like sort of under a door or some
yeah it's as optional functions
yeah
'cause what what i'm i'd be a bit worried about is if someone was h had previously developed habits of expecting to control surround sound or this and that with their controller and then and then they
you know w they get ours and w it's doesn't have that
i dunno if that'd be a problem
okay
another thing that you were saying about categorising the controls
mm-hmm
um maybe i could suggest we we break them down into three simple categories
yeah
okay
one would be audio controls one would be video controls and the other one would be a device
mm-hmm
okay
um this may not map very well to advanced functionality especially but i think that um from a manufacturer's point of view from a person designing the device
yeah
but i think from a point of view of a person using the device you know a t. v. is something they see and something they hear
mm-hmm
um it's something they do other things to like turn it on and turn it off
yeah
i mean like so what we could have is like three buckets right where we could throw things into like if we want this feature
right
let's throw it into there and then from there decide whether it's basic or it's non basic
yeah
'kay okay
i mean it might help with the visualisation
like that
okay
and it would actually help with the component build as well
mm-hmm
okay right
mm okay great
um okay well i gotta kind of got five minutes to wrap up now
um next thing we're doing is having lunch
whoohoo
um and then we're gonna have thirty minutes of working on the next stage
um so i'll be putting the minutes of this uh this meeting into the project documents folder
mm-hmm
um so uh i guess just to just to confirm that we know what we're doing in the next well in the thirty minutes after lunch anyway
mm-hmm
um for uh our industrial designer you're gonna be thinking about the components concept
um user interface designer gonna be thinking about our user interface and marketing you're gonna be thinking about trend watching
um and you'll all get specific instructions as well
so um i dunno just just to to ask now if you've got anything else you've thought about while we've been talking
um do you wanna start with david
anything else to say at all
mm no not really
no okay
um yeah just i just wanted to ask then before we wrap up
andrew
shall we agree for sake of um sort of clarity and when we when we r resume that we'll u use this idea david's proposed
where we think of these three sort of buckets and anything anything we discuss about them is sort of okay we're talking about this
yeah yeah i think that's definitely a good idea
uh-huh
shall we do that then
mm
yeah
okay great
um just about the three buckets um what would go in the the device functions one
um things like on off
because they don't have anything to do with what you see
yeah
i me mean in terms of picture and the entertainment value you know um so um and channel
okay
and and channel
right
because the on off also goes you know like on off like power not on off sound
not on off video
yeah
although you don't turn off the video on your t. v.
but um you might wanna you know turn off the sound say you wanna pick up the phone there's a mute button right
okay
so you you have you have a choice of putting it on to um others or a device
okay
device is basically anything which we can't categorise right
okay so you're gonna have um audio which is gonna be like you know your bass settings and actual volume hi okay
we put it out
mm-hmm
yeah anything to do with what you hear right
mm-hmm
you you put that into audio
okay and then visual
mm-hmm
and then video is anything that you can see
mm-hmm
okay so brightness contrast things like that and then just actual device things
um
yep
colour yeah
yep
like what channel you're watching turning on an off stuff like that
sure
sure
yep
okay
okay um
and then k i suppose quite likely what would happen is in the d device category there might be some which are just like the habitual standard and then others which are maybe a bit more yeah
like random which we have no other place to put but we need it somewhere there
mm-hmm
yeah
sure okay
okay
okay
um even even if it doesn't map very clearly what happens is that people at least have some in their mind
it's easy to use
i think that's one thing that um and i guess from the component point of view it's easy to build as well 'cause things are like fixed
okay
okay
okay
um so yeah i guess just things to think about are you know like the fact it's gotta look good
because of who we're we're you know targeting this at
um something maybe kind of quirky in design maybe
mm-hmm
make it kind of ergonomic kind of to hold you know things like that
mm-hmm
um so i guess i guess that's it
great
that's the meeting over
whoohoo
then we get to go find out what was picked up for lunch for us
's to do now is to decide how to fulfil what your stuff is so in that sense so it does kind of make sense yeah
yeah
okay
yeah sure
okay well
it kinda does make sense doesn't it because when we get into the end of meeting we're kind of talking about action and design as opposed to background
yep
okay
everything i have is kinda background
okay we all ready to go
yep
well how um on the in this meeting then if we um
i'll just just recap on the minutes from the last meeting
and we uh decided on
yep
decided on our our target group being fifteen to thirty five and we decided that it was gonna be non rechargeable battery powered
mm-hmm
that we're gonna group our audio visual and other functions into into those categories um
and i told you guys about the three new requirements about ignoring teletext ignoring everything except the t. v.
and trying to incorporate the the uh corporate colour and slogan
um so that was the last meeting
is there anything have i forgotten anything
mm-hmm
no
uh that sounds
is that everything
okay
um so if we have the three presentations and then if you have anything to kind of that you know you're gonna want to discuss
maybe just make a note of it and we'll have all the discussion at the end
that might be a better idea this time
sure
and so if we start off uh with andrew and then craig and then david if that's alright
okay
sure
um and then after that we'll have to make some decisions about stuff right
yep
yeah cool
so if you wanna take this
why don't i get that
hmm
screwed in quite tightly
uh what did uh how did we leave it with speech recognition now
we did we say we were gonna try maybe incorporate it but we hadn't made a definite decision on that
mm-hmm
right
oh i should also point out that um the you know the kind of final objective of this meeting is to reach a decision on the concepts of the product
okay
so um that's kind of the end result hopefully
okay
um alright so c is it function f. eight
uh-huh
hopefully appear in a wee second
hmm
come on
i think it's working
up there we go
okay great s so let me just start this
okay great
so um uh s move on
uh-huh oh where'd it all go
oh no
it's not good
okay lemme just see where i can find it
this looks more like it
i think i just opened up the template
sorry about that
oh right
okay alright so let's have a look here
okay so this was the method that um i've taken
here we go
uh basically what i wanna do here before we get into it uh too far
is i want to show you all the background information i have that i think we need to acknowledge if we want this to be successful
okay
and uh and then sorta g go through some of the way that i've dealt with that information
and then sort of bring us all together into it to see sorta see how this fits in with the overall vision
um so i've tried to take a whole lot of market research and summarise it for us
and then ide identify uh trends that are are sort of in sync and are important to our our uh p project plan that we have so far
and then uh initiate a kind of discussion on design options so that it sorta helps us to to narrow in on on aspects that will inform other uh other elements of the of the project
does that make sense tha that sort of strategy
mm-hmm
yep
i thought that that will impact on the rest of what we do so that's why i suggested we get in this
aye a fair point definitely
okay so out of um different uh figures and ratings ob uh of people in general
um consumers in general the number one thing that was found was that uh the br t television remote control
a fancy look and feel okay and not it specified not a functional look or or feel uh b f f fancy
okay
um however this is where we kinda have to be very i think creative about it
number two was that it be innovative
okay so that tells me that we have to find a way to be innovative without a adding just unnecessary um sort of functional bits to it
uh and third priority uh for ease of use so again that kind of gives us a general picture of how it has to be
um quite user friendly while still having technology
so it i'll just say right away as a bit of a foreshadowing into how we proceed with this in terms of m marketing
is that i think um what we should think about is how the um
about how the innovation uh contributes to the look and feel and not so much to the functionality of it
for example like when you pick it up and push it like it all lights up or something you know what i mean like
aye right
or it's got something else to it that just seems innovative because obviously the thing that the message here is ease of use
uh-huh
so how do you make innovation make something more more easy to use
well that's i guess where we're gonna go with this
okay
okay then there's the other aspect of the back the the market um
research i have here is on fashion style okay which as we've agreed is a priority
uh top european fashion trend um that i read about says there's this emerging theme of fruit and vegetables okay especially in clothes and furniture
and when i first saw that i thought hmm well do we want to actually try and think about this trend and how we add something to it
or we get right into it or we completely steer away from it do you know what i mean
okay okay
so my my feeling is that we w do want to observe this trend
but we want to think also about the fact that it sort of has to fit in with something which is not specifically electronics
um 'cause i think what we're in what we're in is partly sort of home decor partly something like a computer
um so i think we might wanna be careful about how you know how quickly we create like a remote control in the shape of an apple or something
i think that would be pushing it
and then in terms of m material trends are for things to be soft and spongy and sort of you might say ergonomic or or friendly to handle
which is which also in indicated that last year this was this was not the case
so um probably a lot of the competition on the market will be still in last year's mode
so if we try and really capitalise on that i think that'll be in our favour
um
so these this is the summary of everything
um style is number one uh thing in the in the market of who we're selling to
uh innovative design technology's also a must in that it's seen it'd be seen to be uh cutting edge
uh but ease of use t has to be insured throughout
that was like the number three thing
and then at the end there are vibrant natural colours um
that's the way i interpreted it anyway softness in materials shape and function
and so i've written at written at the bottom to give us sort of a context of discussion
mac ipods something which is i'd have to say very high tech
mm-hmm
ten gigabytes whatever but when you hold it in your hand there's like no buttons
you know what a mac ipod is
mm that's true yeah
i'm thinking however mac ipod is sort of last year's because it's very hard and sort of glassy and glossy
so i'm thinking if we imagine that we're taking some of the features of a mac ipod and we're then making it s more of like a more of like a comfortable type of or more of like a
maybe more vibrant to friendly thing to have
um and then so this is w with all that information what i'm what i'm suggesting in this slide here is that we we take these ideas
and as we get into more the more um techni like sort of production side of things
that we think about shape materials and themes or series that go throughout
sort of like a
i dunno like um we think of some kind of a thin theme that unifies it all that we agree on uh sorta like a marketing identity
um
does that make sense
yeah
so so like i threw out a few ideas there just to kinda get us thinking along those lines like lemon
lime i dunno green colours pe whatever it's just an idea
'cause i'm thinking that some of these ideas will seem quite coherent if we use them in terms of their what people associate this them with in terms of texture
shape colours things like that
mm 'kay
great
like um the ones the ones which i'm most fond of in terms of giving like a theme to it would be like um like lemon or something like that
you know something which is like you see a lot in in other areas
like i see lots of websites and things that seem to associate with like lemon and lime and
okay
so anyway it's just just an idea
yeah
i'm thinking maybe we could incorporate some of these features into a fairly um into something which is which seems to have something to it which is almost gimmicky because like um like something to do with like lighting within it
like you know just within the simple sense when you pick up a phone and touch a button it uh lights up q usually the buttons light up
ah
how can we build on that
maybe like it could light up in different colours or something or or people could buy the buy the control and then it comes with different like
covers or something so
okay
anyway those are that's all i have but uh hopefully we can we can revisit those ideas when we get into
that's great
uh-huh
okay great
um thank you for that
uh craig do you wanna
yep
uh plug yours in then
is it working
mm
not quite
did you press f. eight
it's probably not sending
yeah
oh something coming now yeah
yep there it is
there we go
and so think of this concept
um to research it i've um had a look on the the homepage again
it's provided me with more examples of um previously existing c remote controls
um there's a wee bit of discussion about the other existing ones there
um so i've taken the um suggestions from them and tried to incorporate them into this um
so then this we're looking for um suggestions on size th um size of control and the buttons
um the shape of the control and whereabout the buttons should be located on the control
mm
um what i found from the research is that most the current controls are just basically big bricks with loads of buttons all over them
um they're not very attractive to look at and they're not very comfortable to hold
they're i just hold 'em like big bricks and they're very easily lost
um they tend to be very dark colours so if there are shadowy places down the side of couches you can't really see them
mm-hmm
um the the controls themselves tend to use a very inconsistent colour scheme
um for instance the stand by button isn't always red uh it really should be
it's uh something the user then uh identify with
this is a red switch off that's how it should be
um i'm not sure if there's any other examples of that but something to look out for
um there's a problem that i've i've got couple of preferences for the the end control um i get 'em with the the red colour button for stand by and s the other examples of that um
the buttons should be large
they shouldn't be tiny little things like you get on some mobile phones
they should be easy to press very comfortable
um one of the examples given on the homepage was um there's an up and down volume button but both of them have a v. on them
so the up volume button looks like it should be a down volume button that's kinda confusing
mm-hmm
um should avoid s things like that
um if the the corporate colour scheme allows it we should have a very bright colour so that it can be easily identified anywhere
okay
um obviously trying trying to avoid being tacky there but it could um tie in very easily with your your lime and lemon idea
yeah
okay do we have a corporate colour scheme
i think it's yellow because like the website is yellow and there's a band at the bottom is yellow so yellow
i didn't know
okay
and the play doh 's yellow
okay
lemon you know definitely food for thought there but keep going and we'll discuss it after
fantastic
okay
um
yeah
any extra features we add beyond the basic ones should be m hidden
they shouldn't be on the um shouldn't be visible without something be opened or some sort of special extra effort
mm-hmm
um if we did decide to go for voice activation there sh should always be a button as alternative
possibly hidden in the the opened up section um making that something is wrong with it or with somebody's voice maybe they got a cold or
um we should definitely avoid the big square block look
that's just wrong
mm-hmm
mm 'kay
and um we got an email uh from i think it's the the research department
and they've said th the voice control um can now talk back if you ask it a question
mm
so it sh it could be good to have them um confirm any action you take
aye that's a good idea yeah
and possibility
right and these are problems i've had with it
um i don't know where the slogan should go or really what the slogan is
i think it's um fashion into electronics
yeah
and we don't know how flexible the colour scheme is
i mean you say you wanted the the corporate colours but they don't say you know if we can use any other colours at all or
mm
mm
okay
that's it
cool
okay
great
lots of good information there
yeah that that was very good and uh now with david
mm-hmm
mm 'kay um
i think i'm cool
it's a shame the cable wasn't just in the middle of the table huh
i know it'd be handy wouldn't it
just um
oops
do y do you wanna sit in the the line of sight of this um
yeah okay
let me just get this going first
yeah
ah there it is
it takes a second doesn't it
'kay that should be it
okay um i guess the same thing again i started with something very basic
so just so you guys have some idea of what's involved in my process
mm-hmm
um and then you can just work through it and we 'll either modify it or start from scratch um depending on what your needs are
um the components are exactly the same
mm-hmm
um i think like what you guys said um the most input that's needed is basically in the user interface
the rest of the components um they do have an impact in terms of cost and complexity
um like you said time to market was a problem um and how many components are physically in there in cost
and the power is basically a factor of that
um and the lower components the power the logic the transmitter and the infrared um they affect you in terms of the size of your device
um and that would have some inte impact on how y i think more how you hold rather than um the actual use using the the remote control because um like we've said we've defined
like we only want the basic things that to be visible and the rest of them we try to hide
mm-hmm
so um you know it's just a matter of working out space
so i guess three things um cost um complexity and the size
these are the three things that um will have an impact on you
so just go through it in the components
um these are the options that are available to you
um i'm not very sure about the voice thing 'cause i got another email and it was in fact quite sketchy on what n the voice options are
right
um it said it could talk to you but it never said anything about being able to listen
i it said something about a sensor but never clarified that
mm
hmm
so maybe if you well i could see the other email that they sent you
um 'cause they got back to me with like different requirements or different offerings of what components availa
okay so your basic components are buttons okay and you have a wheel available like a mouse scroll wheel
right
mm
mm-hmm
okay there's an l. c. d. display um i think these are quite standard things
they're standard aren't they
no um they're well in the sense that these are all the options available for you
i'll explain to you the complexity and the cost thing again a bit later
yeah
okay um then there's um how the case actually looks
it can actually be flat or it can be curved
um and then the different types of materials that you can use um i don't think you can use them in a combination
mm-hmm
um but um i could check back for you but i don't think you can actually use them in a combination
we you couldn't have like plastic and rubber
um i think plastic and rubber would be fine but plastic rubber and wood i wasn't i'm not very sure about the titanium
yeah
they had some restrictions on using the rubber and the titanium
hmm
mm 'kay
um the rubber was a restriction on the kind of power source you could use
but the titanium had a different kind of things on the shape of the thing so i think that there is some restriction on um
okay
i think you could probably group plastic and rubber together wood and titanium
mm-hmm
but you know it might be easier from a cost perspective and a complexity just to use one
mm-hmm
mm-hmm
you know as opposed to two
mm-hmm
um and the other components are logic chips um again i'll i'll go back to the component chips
the com how complex or how easy the logic is it depends on how many functions you have on the on the unit
um and that impacts cost
um i don't think the logic chip has a issue about size 'cause they should be about the same size
mm-hmm
mm-hmm
power consumption should be about the same
um i think the main impact is complexity um and the other thing is um the power options
hmm
um the first one is a standard battery
okay the second one i think is more of a gimmick then actually a useable thing it's a wind up you know a crank
i'll clear one of these things for you
just by moving it yeah
hmm
yeah but that that might be something i think that's more of a look and feel decision because i don't think you can have one power source if you're using the alternative power sources
i think whatever it is you still need a battery 'cause i don't think anybody wants to keep doing one thing
mm
no
okay the other ones are a solar powered cell
yeah
which may not be a great idea in europe or any country that has seasons 'cause half the year you'd be dead
so like what i said you probably need like a battery and something else
mm-hmm
mm-hmm
um and the kinetic one i guess for me is the most interesting one because it's movement and people like to fiddle with their and it's a nice sales gimmick i think
mm
from a marketing gimmick it it's a technology thing it's a shake it it doesn't work shake it knock it or something
mm-hmm
you know you know you have you had those balls you know those stress balls where you bounce the ball and it and it lights up and it goes
w yeah
hmm
uh yeah yeah i see
yeah
you know that might be a gimmick combined with rubber
hmm
you know just to if you get frustrated wi remote control you can throw it kind of you know just uh you know um so
yeah
hmm
i know what you mean yeah
um okay my from my role i don't think that personal preferences but role preferences i think um something comfortable to hold
mm-hmm
um small and slim i guess that's more in the sense of small and slim in terms of comfortable not so small you can't
you know like a phone or something too small phone
mm-hmm
um and the other thing is from a production point of view um the less components we use and the simpler the components means you reduce your cost and you increase your profit
mm-hmm
um and also the time to market and the complexity of developing designing and debugging it um so
mm-hmm mm-hmm mm-hmm
mm-hmm
um okay let me just go back and talk about some of the restrictions
um
the user interface restrictions basically means that if you use more complicated features
like the buttons are standard okay the l. c. d. panel and the scroll wheel you need more complicated logic
mm
um the case okay with a rubber case you can't have the solar panels
okay with the titanium case let me just check that um titanium case can't be curved it has to be square
okay
okay um there's no restriction on the plastic and it can't be curved on the wood
it can't be curved
okay
so that's again i don't think you can use them in a combination um especially the titanium i i suspect they're very fixed to a particular need
okay
right
so um mixing them may not be a good idea um yep
okay
right can i
that's it
uh question on can i ask a question
yeah well yeah it's just i'm quite keen to get the discussion going with the time we've left so but yeah you c ask away
okay
can we uh power a light in this
can we get a strong enough battery to power a light
um i think we could because the l. c. d. panel requires power and the l. c. d. is a form of a light so that
mm
okay
so maybe one of the things we can just try and include is a really good battery
why what kind of light do you want are you thinking of
well
i mean i'm thinking it might be
that for uh this to be a high tech thing it's gonna have to have something high tech about it and that's gonna take battery power
uh-huh
yeah
and to make that to make that a realistic goal i think one of the issues that will come up later is can the battery power it
are you thinking are you thinking of of a light in the sense of um a light light
or a light in the sense of it glows kind of you know frankenstein it's alive
illuminate the buttons
yeah it glows
well m i'm thinking along the lines of you're you're in the dark watching a d. v. d. and you um you find the thing in the dark and you go like this
okay
and that's what everybody does
oh where's the volume button in the dark and uh y you just touch it or you just pick it up and it lights up or something
yeah yeah yeah
okay
like a phone yeah like the backlight in a phone
okay
like a phone yeah yeah
okay cool
whereas with phones people charge them once a week
yeah
we're gonna need to put in a really good battery so people don't have to charge their r remote control every few days
um that's why i think the option of the the kinetic thing which basically means as long as you shake it like a watch like an automatic watch
but are people gonna wanna shake their movie controller
mm
um it's probably sensitive enough when you fiddle it
right
so you could trigger that to a light like i said the bouncing ball thing
sure
mm
or you could trigger that to use that to power the light as opposed to so when they pick it up
okay
okay
right
right and then that that sorta triggers the
okay
mm-hmm
right okay um well let's just go right back to the marketing ideas for a start
glowingness
okay great
and just giving an id idea on the time we've got about fifteen minutes to play with at most
okay
so um yeah so just t to bear in mind that the ultimate goal of this meeting is to reach an decision on the the the concepts of the product
okay
so back to your idea about um incorporating the idea of like fruit and veg and the corporate colour and things like that
yeah
yeah
um i mean what does everybody think about
does anybody have any ideas of about how we can fit all that in together
i mean that's kind of the user interface type of thing what are your thoughts on that
um i think we could go for like um maybe not a p a fruit shape but a very sort of curvy type shape
um you could have the same sort of texture and colour as a fruit
so maybe do y are we thinking something that like s could sit in your hand comfortably or do you th you'd hold onto comfortably or
um probably something that s sits in your hand comfortably sort of feels right in your hand
so something quite curvy
okay um right okay
colour wise i mean you made a re uh was it you or uh i can't remember who made the point about how if you've a nice bright colour you'll not lose it
was that
whose about how if you have a bright colour you'll not lose it so much
i think he made that
what's that
yeah
um and when the corporate colour is yellow i mean maybe we could think about about the colour of the whole product being yellow i don't know
okay
um
and then obviously the uh the materials when it has anybody got like an overall picture in their mind about what what might work
well i mean i'm thinking that what we need to do is have something that kind of unifies a lot of the different concepts
that's all
and if we think that what we are w our number one marketing motive is um the look and feel
mm-hmm
mm-hmm
so for the look and feel to seem coherent and not just sorta bits and bits and pieces of of concept and technology or or whatever or fashion
then we should have it kind of come back to one thing that we kind of all sorta can visualize
um maybe what we could do is t th think about a concept which touches b back to the on the um the colour you said company colour yellow
mm-hmm
i mean if we think of something like i was saying also lime and lemon you know
mm-hmm
what can we come up with something where we we try and associate it with with like the series
we just come up with something like that we kind of use it as a theme to inspire the
okay
shapes and things
right
is there a particular shape that you're interested in
like does marketing have any research on does it need to be long
does it need with a square thing wha
oh you know like in circular in shape or
yeah 'cause that will n help narrow down the choice of
yeah
choice of material yeah
like fruit
'cause i i i was kinda thinking about as well you know how you get these shock resistant mobile phones
i'm thinking fruits in my head but that's tacky
see i'm
and they're plastic but then also have like rubber on the outside and it kinda feels it feels kind of warmer to the touch
it feels a bit more comfortable and maybe we could incorporate plastic and rubber
yeah
into it
and then then we could have curved shapes 'cause wood or titanium yeah
it's gonna have to be boxy and rectangular and i think we might be moving away from that you know so um
well i'm do we really want it in like the shape of a lemon or no i don't think we do either
no no no not at all
it's more more just that we we think about like
what it is we're trying to achieve so and then we have one one sorta theme that we stick with
do you know what i mean
okay right well um so thoughts about the actual shape of the thing
i'd quite like a sort of uh snowman type shape
a snowman shape
um so a p sort of larger bit sits in your hand and then you got maybe another bubble at the top for just any other function you need
uh-huh
that's quite a distinctive shape that would be good wouldn't it
right sure
yeah
yeah so yeah should we go with that
um can we yeah like to and wha like do you have a
do you wanna draw it on the board
can you like yeah just t we can visualize it
um something like that um you got two groups there um maybe it could fold up and you get a third group inside or uh you have volume controls about there
okay
ooh that'd be good
okay
mm-hmm
yep
so call it the snowman shape trademark
yeah that's cool
um and i mean colour wise what does everybody think
i think it is quite important to get yellow in there somewhere
i mean do you want the whole thing yellow maybe like yellow and white do you want something
mm
so i reckon it'd look quite nice if we just had um this here
had a sorta background yellow and then have sort of a nice bold colour for the buttons
uh-huh
okay cool
um and also i mean how are we going to incorporate the slogan in
the fact that it talks to you i mean it might be quite cool if when you first start using it it says
what is it putting fashion into electronics or something i dunno
or when you like or if you turn it off or something if it can speak if it could actually say the slogan it might be a bit more powerful than just having it written on it somewhere
i think that might scare me
i d i d any thoughts on that at all
i think that'd probably scare me
you turn it on your control possessed s
i know
um unless an a i mean if you also would that work if we wanted to incorporate um an l. c. d. display where would we put that
would we put that on the inside or
um
do we need an l. c. d. display
what what's the functionality of that
it's bound to increase the cost of it a lot i would've thought
yeah but the question is what are we using it what would we what would we achieve from it
what would it achieve
putting in lights is cheap but putting in an l. c. d. panel just to make it glow is a bit of a
well
l. c. well i'd when you used to mention the l. c. d. i'd think i wonder what that would be about
and the th the thing i could see it helping with would be if it was somehow connected with um listings
so as you scroll through 'cause we said we might have a jog dial
yeah
so as you scroll through your stations you can y it actually tells you what it is
mm-hmm
i think that will be a problem because we don't have an input device to get the listings into it
right okay
so um it's a bit nuts to get the monday tuesday wednesday you know
mm oh yeah that's true
yeah
so so no need for an l. c. d. display
mm-hmm
mm-hmm
um i i'm not saying there's no need for an l. c. d. display but um it's what's what what would it tell the user
i think that would make it very complex
'cause the l. c. d. tends to be an output as uh as opposed to an input so um does the remote control need to talk back to the user
yeah
yeah
mm not real
we have the option of the speaker as well the sa the same thing goes for the speaker
is there a need for the remote control to to talk back
i don't know if there is really no um
mm-hmm
nah
um
i would say no need for a talk back
uh does anybody disagree with that
no
you could put a game on it
no
easy
when the t. v. dies you can play with the remote control
mm mm
okay um right so you're gonna have the three different sets of of functionalities
um i mean do you wanna group them into s head of the snowman body of the snowman inside of the snowman is that what you're thinking
um well i think the advanced ones the the ones you don't usually use could be hid inside
okay
b um i think the we had were fairly basic ones they'd have to go on the the front somewhere
okay right um what else do you need to talk about
well i i was just
where would you physically position the buttons
um i think that that has some impact on on on many things
yeah
yeah
um
um maybe you wanna draw onto the
so i'm just gonna um pop this in here 'cause i have a slide about decision making which i'd forgotten about
yep
oh sh god we've got five minutes um okay uh back we go
um energy what do you think that's suggesting we're how we're powering the thing
i really like the idea of this kinetic thing where you'd have the back up of the battery
yeah sure
but have have kinetic power i mean what does anybody think about that
um i've had kinetic things before
and the the the one issue we need to keep in mind with them is that you're committing the user to moving it and watches yeah
no like i said we have a h hybrid kind of thing so it's not gonna charge the battery it's just
sure okay right okay
okay
support for it
i mean just it's just worth pointing out because like i've i've known i've known people to have kinetic watches that they wear all the time
yeah
mm-hmm
and it's just like magic because it's always powered and there's no battery
i've also known people to have things like like a jewellery watch they wear from time to time
and they eventually just say it's just too much of a nuisance because i don't wear it all the time
yeah
yep
like remote control is similar you're away on vacation i dunno whatever you something and it just starts to get worn down
yeah
so we should think about
well i suppose that if you're if you're away and you're not using it then you're not using any power either
so you'd have the battery as the kind of to keep it ticking over idea i'm really sorry we're gonna have to wrap up quite quickly
yeah
we don't have as much time as i thought
yep
um so i think that's what energy is referring to here
chip on print is that that's an industrial design thing is it david
yes yes
okay um as for the case kind of discussed that
and this size here i'd suggest this be small like quite small
yeah i know we're gonna have like rubber buttons that feel kind of
yeah i think so yeah
okay
um just a a lot of the um
i mean one of the things running through my mind right now i realise we're being efficient to wrap up the meeting and have lots of decisions made
mm-hmm
um but we are leaning quite a bit to the side of being low tech rubber buttons plastic frame
it's almost like we're reproducing the same old remote control that's out there
mm 'kay
should we think about how we are actually getting this high tech user friendly uh um theme like what is it that we're u we're using to to achieve those goals
like
could have things like backlighting the buttons and stuff like that
okay so so backlighting that would be good
or even a clear case
um you know a a glowing a a glowing yellow type case where the yellow is showable but in the dark it sort of it's alive
yeah clear that'd be
aye that would be a good idea
okay
yeah sure
um in in a slight subtle way
s so like cur slightly transparent case so it's yellow like tinted yellow but you can maybe see through it
yeah that'd be really good
yeah yeah
yeah
yeah
is that what you mean
or or there might be a light running through it like a mouse
sure
you know you have cordless mice and they don't eat that much power right
yeah yeah
so the power the battery in that sense maybe you have one or two stratig strategically placed lights that sort of
yeah
sure
yeah they they emanate a light through it
okay
yeah but because the case is transparent so it gives it a little bit of a glow doesn't make it freaky
lights
'kay
yeah mm-hmm
okay
um and then the other thing that we we're s we've committed ourselves to achieving is simplicity
and so i'm thinking maybe should we try and think about having something like um some kind of an innovative concept about how the um the volume and the channels are controlled
'cause that's the main thing people will f wanna do
mm
could we use like a jog dial like a nice just sort of round somewhere on it where you just roll it
the question is when you're rolling it how do you wanna roll it
or
do you want 'em to roll it like that
do you want 'em to roll it like that
'cause in a mouse your hand's in a position to roll it
mm
yeah
yeah
whereas the other thing about having it jog dial this way it tends to get moved accidentally
mm-hmm
yeah if you are holding it in your hand you could you could do that couldn't you
well why don't we do it like a mouse then
if you're holding it in your hand you could
that's a very unnatural motion to yeah
do you think
okay
can you imagine you have to scroll a lot
um it might work for volume and maybe some of the brightness controls and stuff like that but not for channels right
yeah
mm
if you have a telewest box you've got like you don't have to buy all the channels you've about fifty channels can you imagine trying to
mm-hmm
yeah okay okay um
yeah
yeah sure
um and i don't think having that you know too quick too slow kin it's confusing to the i dunno
mm
well but then for um for skipping a large amount of channels you do have to uh to skip the channel button the number part
yeah
but users tend to tend to want to use that and once they lose out on the user experience they're like
yeah
okay
uh but
because that's becomes the most accessible thing in front of
okay
but that's not a bad thing is it
just
because when you think about it the alternative is to go push the button
yeah
yeah
jog dials are much easier than that
okay um right well wouldn't it we do need to make a decision on whether we want to incorporate a jog dial in nice and quickly
you just roll
um i'm all for them actually i think they're quite you know th very quick to m to use
yeah
yeah
so does anybody oppose the idea of of incorporating one into the design at all
no
and the other thing was um can we think of any way of getting the slogan into this thing
yeah like i mean if we if if we keep coming back to this board here
uh-huh
i wouldn't be surprised if we could take this idea imagine that i dunno that it's within the shape of the hand it's quite small
uh-huh ooh okay we really gotta wrap up so yeah
i dunno
yeah
it's small and that we've got like the the l slogan somewhere like on the casing at the side
okay well if we can do that great
and that yeah well i mean isn't that what we just h said said we s just have to decide now
yeah okay
yeah let's let's try and get the slogan on there um and
yeah
and then like a jo
so you wanna expand the shape of the
and then like a jog dial somewhere that fits in with the shape of it like i dunno like here in with the
that that might have one problem in terms of um in terms of whether you're left handed or you're right handed you might be locking yourself in
it would get bumped it's doesn't really fit with your hand
yeah
mm
or maybe just fit it in like down the middle here
mm
could i just could i just jump in and suggest something quickly
okay
right i'm gonna have to i'm really gonna have to hurry you on here 'cause we're we're actually over time
a jog di
yeah
it's kind of yeah
um is there anything anybody's unsure about
just for in closing just the next meeting's gonna be in thirty minutes
and so you can see in the screen here what each of you are gonna hopefully be doing
yeah
uh i know that the designers are gonna be working with play doh on that
so um that'll be that'll be good
huh
um and i'll get the the minutes up as soon as possible
anything at all you think we haven't discussed that we need to
is everybody kind of happy about what they're gonna be doing
um
um i think one thing would be the jog dial 'cause that's gonna have quite a big impact on the thing um
yeah i think the jog dial you know it just after you drew that what if it was flat and you just spun it that'd be great
yeah that's what i was thinking the a slide because then you you don't have to put the hand
yeah
yep
i think incorporating a logo is quite straight forward
there's lots of space for it um
okay
that's kind of a design thing that you guys can can discuss yeah
yeah but it's also a a marketing and a function
sure yeah yeah and materials we sorta said we'd do plastic and rubber didn't we
okay
yeah
yeah
and i think maybe we should try and stay away from just the big protruding rubber buttons 'cause that'd just be so standard
to make something flush with the case
something a bit more flush yeah or maybe have rubber incorporated into the case as well
okay right
so that it has and also t plastic i've seen can get really textured so you can get plastics that actually feel soft in your hand
okay
sp kinda grippy
feel like fruit
okay
fruits kids
they feel kind of like um you get pens now and then that you'd think that they were rubber but they're not
no like
yeah yeah
they're actually just plastic that's textured kind of a little bit like
yeah yeah kinda like that yeah
okay i'm gonna have to i'm gonna have to call this to a close 'cause we're way over time
so um that's really good like we've s had much to talk about that um pretty much run out of time to do so
okay
so off you go and design stuff wooh
okay
play doh time
yeah quite jealous actually
you got to choose first
no we're kidding
okay can i just swipe your power cable i don't think it matters
okay lemme okay i'm gonna pull everybody out first and then put in whoever needs to be left
it's you
argh
this is a real hassle and a oops
i'm gonna take the microphones 'cause it's too lazy t take them off again
cool
okay we all all set
right
well this is the uh final detailed design meeting
um we're gonna discuss the look and feel design the user interface design and we're gonna evaluate the product
and the end result of this meeting has to be a decision on the details of this remote control like absolute final decision
um and then i'm gonna have to specify the final design in the final report
so um just from from last time to recap we said we were gonna have a snowman shaped remote control with no l. c. d. display no need for talk back
it was hopefully gonna be kinetic power and battery uh with rubber buttons maybe backlighting the buttons with some internal l. e. d. s to shine through the casing
um hopefully a jog dial and incorporating the slogan somewhere as well
anything i've missed
no
okay um so uh if you want to present your prototype go ahead
uh oh
this is it
ninja homer made in japan
um there are a few changes we've made
um well look at the expense sheet
okay
and uh it turned to be quite a lot expensive to have open up and have lots of buttons and stuff inside
mm
mm-hmm
so instead we've um this is gonna be an l. c. d. screen um just a a very very basic one
very small um with access to the menu through the the scroll wheel and uh confirm
um button
mm 'kay
uh apart from that it's just pretty much the same as we discussed last time
and there isn't uh d it doesn't open up to the advanced functions
so the advanced functions are still hidden from you but they're hidden in the sense that um they're not in use
where are they
um they're in the l. c. d. panel and the jog dial
ah right
okay 'cause
great
so w what kind of thing uh is gonna be
the l. c. d. panel just displays um functionally what you're doing
if you're using an advanced function right like um c brightness contrast whatever it will just say you know it's like it only has four columns
right
okay
it's a very simple l. c. d. like whereas many the minimum amount we need that the user will automatically know like this is brightness or this is contrast
right
mm-hmm
right 'kay
okay cool
it might even be one a bit more complex l. c. d. panel with pictures like maybe the sun or the
okay
you know the the symbols of the various functions
mm-hmm and what is this here
oh right okay
cool
that's a number pad
okay so the number pad is 'kay great
where are we gonna have the slogan
um they're al along this yeah
you know just like right inside there
okay cool
you have this space here and then you have this thing on the side as well or at the bottom
okay
'cause slogans are usually quite small right they're not like huge so they're s
mm
yep
say a button's about say a button's about this size right so you would still have plenty of space for a slogan say even for that
okay
looks good
yep
mm-hmm
so if this isn't to scale what kind of
dimensions are you thinking about here
well we want the other buttons to be big enough to push easily with a finger so we reckon maybe that'll be about the same size as the palm of your hand
mm-hmm
okay
yep so that would be about a centimetre for a button so one two three
four centimetres
plus maybe half o five
mm-hmm
about nine in total
six seven eight about yeah nine total
six seven eight nine ten
so we're talking about ten centimetres
that sounds good
yeah
that would be good
yep
so ten centimetres in height
nine ten
yep
okay um
that'd be good in fact a pen is about ten centimetres usually
so that would be that sounds like a really good size if you see it there
yeah
that's great and it's very bright as well
mm
so um okay
is it possible uh i'm just gonna bring up the idea of colours
is these are these the colours that of production or is this just what we had available
well i'm
we're gonna have again the the sort of the foggy um yellow from last time that lit up when you pushed the button
right
um
okay so just could you just list all the things that it does s so i can write them in the report
but um this button um because it's red it's sort of very prominent
we're gonna use it as uh it can be the power button if you hold it for maybe two seconds it'll send a stand by signal
excuse me
mm-hmm
um apart from that it's gonna be used as a confirm button for the l. c. d. screen and you use this as a jog dial
sure
okay
okay so that's like an okay button right
mm-hmm
oh we've discussed how h high it is but how wide is it
i don't know
okay
how high is it
no as in the height but what about the width
yeah
didn't put five centimetres
oh oh like depth of the actual thing
do we need five
i don't think five is be about th three and a half
um
okay
something by there
oh is this k to get an idea of scale from your from your thing there okay
yeah yeah
sure
so you can power on and off what else can you do
three and a half
um you can skip straight to a channel using these buttons
okay
um were gonna have the volume control here
but um because we've got the the l. c. d. and the jog dial we just thought we'd um use that as the volume
okay jog dial for volume
and what else do you do with the jog dial
mm-hmm
um you can use it for um more advanced functions like contrast colour and
contrast brightness yeah and anything else
um yeah
um just whatever else we wanted to include as the advanced functions um we didn't actually go through and specify the
well of the designers what are they
uh what can a t. v. do
okay things like um brightness contrast um maybe tuning the channels
uh-huh
okay channel tuning
um
that's a good one
what else
um the various inputs
are you having a v. c. r. are you having you know which input do you have
mm-hmm mm-hmm
okay auxiliary inputs
mm-hmm probably colour or sharpness
um
yep colour sharpness
sharpness
um a lot of these things will have to be um free and open for users to define them
mm-hmm
okay what about uh sound settings
uh d can you change any of those at all
audio
audio we have like your basic y your base your mid range your high range
um
the the balance hmm
um
yep left right balance um maybe even pre programmed sound modes
like um the user could determine like a series of sound modes
okay
and then what could happen would be um when you click on that then it would go to that setting
mm-hmm
okay is there anything else at all it can do
mm 'kay
yeah
that 'cause that's that's fine
just need to know so i can write it down
okay um right i g i guess that's it so we can now um
we can now have a little look at the
the excel sheet and price listing and see if we need to
mm-hmm
um if we need to rethink anything at all
so um for this first part here power wise have we got battery
the battery
do we have kinetic as well
no
no
okay just battery
um
we need an
and that's because of cost restraints is it
yep
yeah
okay um what about the electronics here
yeah advanced chip
we need an advanced chip i think yep
advanced chip
let me just confirm that
yes i think so
yep
okay um the case what does it mean by single and double do you know
um i think single would just be sort of one sort of oval whereas double is this sort of thing
yeah
so we want double curved
yep
okay
um
plastic
is there any rubber at all in the buttons or any
i think we're gonna have to skip the rubber
okay um and we wanted special colours didn't we
um
yep
so i'll have to put that oh no wait we ho how many colours have we got there
for the case itself one colour
it's one special colour
just one colour okay
'cause the case unit itself the rest of our components go on top of it
okay so interface wise is it this third option we have the two of them there
mm
yes
one and the l. c. display
okay and then buttons we have what two colours
how many
um we have um got some push buttons as well
or even clear
we've got push buttons as well
like uh oh wait so push button and integrated scroll wheel push okay
'kay
so i reckon we've got one button for this thing 'cause it's just one big sheet of rubber
uh-huh
i'm not sure if that counts but
okay
okay let's just be safe and put like say four buttons for that one
okay
okay um and maybe a special colour for the buttons so maybe four again
four
you can see we're we're all very far beyond the
so w why are we arriving at the number four
where does the number four come from
'cause that's one button by its the complexity of twelve buttons
okay right so we're writing down four
so we're just estimating that yeah it would be less
okay
how about these
are we wanting them in no they're just is everything gonna be plastic
no
yep
yep
okay
so we're w w quite far over
now we're gonna something's gonna have to go
um we're at sixteen point eight and
uh how mm-hmm how are we going to achieve this high end product if
well we h something has to go to the tune of two point t three euro
we only have very sparse
so let me see what are we i mean oh yes sorry four point three
two point three
four point three no
my maths is all out
well we could take out ones by making it single curved just fill in those bits
yeah
and then where is the
how much would that save us
how much would that save us
that will only save you one
that is one
one
the other thing could be that um you could take away the l. c. d. panel and the advanced chip together um because when you
do something on the t. v. the t. v. responds and reacts as well
mm-hmm
so the user could be looking at the t. v. and pushing his thing so we may not need to so when we scroll we need just some way to get the t. v. to respond
that's fair enough yeah
mm-hmm
mm-hmm
okay so
mm-hmm
which i think is a technically doable thing so
mm-hmm
so w what's our reviewed suggestion
um take away the l. c. display
yep
and the advanced chip goes away as well
mm-hmm
to be replaced with a regular chip
regular chip
yep
mm-hmm
okay
so what that means is that um
and so we've got point three to get rid of
um and we ha where are the four the four push buttons are where exactly now
the twelve buttons that you see there
twelve buttons
that's um one piece of rubber but it's gonna have twelve button things underneath so
yeah
functionally you're gonna have to intercept so four is a good estimate for
do you think
yeah so you can't actually cut it's like three times the number of buttons four eight twelve
like is is that one big button or is it twelve buttons how can it be something in between
it it needs to be more than one big button because if you open up your phone
underneath there's actually one button underneath it's just that the panel itself is a single panel
mm-hmm
mm
mm-hmm
okay well we have point three to get rid of somewhere
we just report that it has to be over budget or the colours you could take away s colours for th for the buttons
mm
no can do
yeah we could just go with um
yeah w
normal coloured buttons
well do you want colour differentiation here
no that's not the button we're talking about
um
oh yeah sorry yeah then
that's the buttons only refer to the pad so
right so
should we take that off uh
ah
hey it's back to the original
that's it
hmm
um so then these just become normal coloured buttons so that might be some some way of cutting the cost
mm-hmm
mm
okay ach that's a shame
um right so take away that completely
ah
and now we're under budget
so we do have point five euro to play with if we wanted
so i reckon
um
how about with embossing the logo isn't that going to cost us some money
doesn't say so
yeah
that's a freebie
reckon that probably counts as a special form for the buttons
yeah
yeah that's a good idea
just one
does that mean that one button has a special form or
i think there's just one button so handy
yeah okay
well well there we go
so i'm just gonna have to redraw this now
so we're not gonna have the l. c. d. anymore and we'll just gonna have an on t on the t. v. it'll show you what you're doing
which i think is fair enough and so this is gonna be one big thing here
um
was the goal in your in your prototype design that it be as low profile as possible
what do you mean by profile
yeah
sort of flat as possible
no
you see i envision it as being um quite deep sort of deep enough to be comfy to hold in your hands rather than being wide and flat
yeah
yeah that's what i was thinking to sure okay
we didn't have enough play doh to make it three d.
yeah alright yeah fair enough
okay just thought i'd ask
so there's one more dimension to the thing which we need to to add
mm-hmm
and you might want to add in the report length width and height
right okay
yeah
so just to well to be thorough then width wise we're looking at about what three centimetres or something
yeah
okay and then so height wise
hmm
how how tall do you envisage it being
about that big
yeah it works yeah
two
about two centimetres okay
two's not very high at all though
maybe a bit higher
this is about this is about two
slightly more than two so
yeah
see about that thick
okay
maybe closer to three even or two and a half
ach that is yeah
okay
okay we'll s we'll say two point five
okay um so we have it within cost anyway
um so yeah project evaluation is this point
um
mm-hmm
right uh
okay so can we close that
this is what it's the final spec that it's gonna be
mm-hmm
someone is gonna have to yeah that's fine that's fine
um it's probably just i dunno if it's worth getting into
but um just in in that we want this to be stylish should we think a little bit more out of the box in terms of a button grid
because i've seen there's lots of devices out there that that instead of taking your standard nine nine square grid
and they have it sort of stylized or in different concept that that
i think that's something that's very hard to catch so you you restrict the number of people who wanna try something
yeah
sure okay
the the look and the colour is something which is cool
yeah alright
but i think that there's also that factor of if it's too unfamiliar then um because when you put it on the shelf
okay sure
what about button shape
square buttons
yeah button shape might be a good idea to change rather than rather than positioning
okay
yeah
'cause i think positioning is we're kinda engrained into the the telephone kind of
sure
yeah
yeah
okay
pad
right um
so at this point we uh let me see discuss uh how satisfied we all are with um
with these four points with the room for creativity in the project and leadership and teamwork and the stuff we had around us i guess
mm 'kay
um let me see uh
do you want me to d um
do you want me to do my um design evaluation last
yeah i wasn't really sure what that was
maybe we should do the design evaluation first
or
yeah yeah go for that first
evaluation
i wasn't entirely sure what uh who was supposed to be doing that but y you go for it
okay
sure
um alright so the way this works i'm gonna need to plug into powerpoint i'll try and do it as quick as possible
okay
okay
um this is um i'll just go over your head if that's okay
yeah
i don't think you need the power so
what's that
no that's okay that's okay
i don't need the powerpoint
no the power cord itself
oh course yeah that's true
yeah so then you have a bit more freedom to
let me get that
a bit more
okay so what this is is a set up for us to um uh use a kind of a like a
you you still have your blue fingers
is it
you killed a monster
the idea is that i've set up i've reviewed all of the um the points of discussion from the beginning
and used that as a criteria of evaluation for the um uh for the current design uh th or the plan and uh so we can review that
uh i think it's gonna end up being sort of elementary because we're sort we're in n we're not gonna probably use it to change anything but
doesn't seem like it's going does it
oh there it is
yeah okay great
uh and i'm gonna write up our results on the board
so this'll be a way for us to go through and decide if we're um sort of review where we stand with it
okay so um
so to sort of b bring together two things sort of design goals and also the market research that we had uh when we rate this
one is v high in in succeeding or fitting to our original aim and seven is low okay
mm 'kay
so these i these i th are the and um we've been asked to uh to collectively rate this
so what we can do is try and just y work on a consensus system so
we just come to an agreement
okay
okay
so the first one uh stylish look and feel
i rate that pretty highly
well yeah i mean compared to most remote controls you see that's pretty good
yeah
yeah
i dunno like a six or something
yeah
yeah um me uh my only reservation with it was that we basically went with yellow because it's the company's colour
what does anybody else think
mm
and i don't know if yellow's gonna really be a hit
mm
but
okay
i'm seeing five then
what do you guys think
i would say five or six
okay
david
yep i'm fine with that
okay let's go with five then
okay
fi oh uh just actually the opposite
it's one to seven right
the so it meant three okay
oh yes sorry then then i would say two or three
wait what's the scale one to seven right
one's high ish isn't it
yeah
yeah one is high
ah okay so yeah two or three
'kay
okay it's upside down
let's go with two point five then
okay um control high tech innovation
well it has the wee jog dial but
we had to remove
yeah so we've had to remove a few of our features we wanted but jog dial
mm
's good
i'd go with three or four maybe three
say it's more
eight three
medium but going towards a little bit higher than medium kind of thing
okay three
yeah about three okay
yep
okay um
style reflects a fruit inspired colour design
i shouldn't have said colour but just
lemon
well that's kind of
okay the blue the blue colours and don't re don't actually represent the colour
yeah
sorta
except for the b the the red button they because for want of a
yeah
okay
but the yellow i mean it could be a lemon yellow colour couldn't it
right
yeah could be
yeah
yeah the the yellow is more representative of the colour but the button itself the blue can be anything else
okay
yeah
okay so we'll go two
mm-hmm
yeah
okay and um design is simple to use simple in features
well yeah i mean it's really basic looking isn't it
f f yeah f fairly basic you guys think
i mean i'd give that nearly a one
yeah one
yep that's fine
yeah one
okay
um soft and spongy have we achieved that
we've used mostly plastic in the end so it's going to be quite a bit of a compromise for price
yeah i think it's about five
five
five
yeah well we have to use uh plastic so it's probably gonna be
that's really low
well
yeah i suppose mm 'kay
that's
um
yeah company logo
could we have used an entirely rubber frame to it
was that an option
i think i'd probably increase the cost
i think it'll be cost prohibitive yeah
we've only got like what ten cents left so
it would cost more than plastic
okay logo we've got it in there haven't we
yep
yep
gonna have that on the side aren't we like there or something
huh
and um it's within budget yep
it is isn't it
yeah
okay so we can say then that uh out of a possible or what would be our goal here
out of forty nine i guess
yeah out of forty nine with with zero being the highest
we are at uh two seven eight ten fifteen point five
's pretty good
so it's pretty good
translates to something like about approximately seventy two percent efficacy
of our original goal
right
uh yeah
i think 'cause if you turn that into
a hundred
it would be about
twice that about thirty one
about thirty one and then invert that it's
so yeah ab well yeah about sixty nine seventy percent yeah
oh right about seventy yeah seventy percent
it's pretty good
okay good
that was just a little formality for us to go through
okay
yep oh hundred pound pen
sorry alright
nobody saw it honestly
no
the cameras did
hmm
is that you all have all finished or
yeah that's that's me
i did have one other um one other frame i thought i mean i i d not knowing how we would deal with this information
i thought okay in theory this kind of a process would be about refining our design revisiting our original goals
uh-huh
it's not something i need to p push through but i thought should we thinking more about the dimensions
um sort of like more of a three dimensional shapes as well as opposed to just that flat um
mm-hmm
could our design involve a series of colours so that it's more of like a line where we have like sort of the
yep
i don't know like the harvest line or the vibrant
i dunno the whatever just some theme and then we have different tones lime green lemon
okay
it's just discussion
i mean obviously we can just abandon this it's fine
i'm just thinking about what we originally set out to do
um yep so there
right
that's all
okay great um are you submitting the
the um evaluation criteria or am i
i don't know what your instructions have been
um i think to record it and uh i haven't been asked to submit it yet
yeah
okay uh just wondering if i need to include it in the minutes because if you're submitting it anyway then okay great
i will yeah
it keeps getting too big
cool
um right uh well next up then because we've done finance is the project evaluation
'kay i'm i'm listening i'm just trying to incorporate the logo into the the thing so i'm playing with the play doh as well
oh right okay
just in case you're wondering why is he still playing with the play doh
huh
just about right l. e. g. o. lego
my leg
right okay
um well do you wanna um just individually say what you think about about these four points and or not those four points
my four points sorry forgotten that
you got a different uh
yep
i like those printer cables that just have the two little butterfly clips like that
oh yeah they're good aren't they yeah
it's really quick
right okay um yeah here we are
to use
uh as a note we'll do this
alphabetically
um do you wanna start andrew
sure um so what is it you're asking of me now
i don't know just um your opinion on those four those four points really and how we used them
or sort of our work on setting this up
yeah
yeah
well is it uh okay i'll just go through your system then
the the room uh
is fairly institutional but um the main thing is i think
um our use of this space is more just to report on things as opposed to be creative and constructive and it would probably help to um have l sort of a cumulative effect of we have ideas and we come back and then the ideas are still in discussion
you know as in other words this this room is sort of a centre point of creativity
uh-huh
whereas in reality as we've gone through this it's not really the centre point of creativity it's more just a
well d do you feel though that that you were able to have quite a lot of creative input into the thing
d debating
yeah yeah but that's just the thing is the quest in terms of the the first point there the room
it feels as though the creativity goes on when we leave
and then we come here and then we kind of put out our ideas and then you know
but i don't i don't think it means the room as in this room
i think it means like you know
oh oh right right oh right okay room for creativ oh right i just looked up and saw okay whiteboard digital pens the room
yeah
room
oh yeah
no of course yeah
well i dunno do you th i think it means um i think it means did you feel you were able to give creative input so
sorry
huh
yeah
yeah i th okay on th um yeah dif answering the question uh in those terms i'd say that actually there's sort of a tease of creativity because we're asked to work through this
but actually the guidelines are fairly contrived in terms of um okay fashion trends
mm-hmm
say fruit and vegetable colour scheme but then i then we're told okay use the co company company colours
mm
so what do we do
we're told okay um think in terms of style and look and feel and technology but build something for twelve and a half pounds
okay
so actually the creativity was more more of like a um a f sort of a f formality then an actual
you feel like you're caged within whatever y it's like a balloon in a cage it can only go so big and not hit the side
okay
yeah within the constraints the
yeah
yeah yeah
the constraints do come in very fast
okay uh do you know what actually let's take each point and everybody discuss it i think
so
yeah
yeah
so still on the topic of room for creativity uh next up is craig
um i agree with his point it's um it is quite a lot of fun t to go and then you have sort of hit the end then go right
gotta cut everything out 'cause we don't have enough money
yeah
yeah
yep
i think another point is that the meetings um are more brainstorming sessions than meetings so time is also a very s um strong factor and structure
yeah
yeah
yeah
because for a brainstorming meeting you want a structure that allows you to allows ideas to get tossed
mm-hmm mm-hmm
mm
um to be evaluated and to be reviewed and to get feedback and come back
yeah yeah
and i guess that point about the room not being r very friendly to that i think that's a very big thing
yeah
and i think the fact that we're wearing these things restricts i feel it 'cause i wear m my glasses
yeah sure
yeah
right and that but that irritates me right it it it does actually you know affect how w whether you feel comfortable to communicate
yeah
new creativity
i feel like i'm hiding behind the equipment rather than the equipment is helping me and you know
yep
right
so you think a more relaxed atmosphere would be more kind of conducive to creative thought or
not not so much an atmosphere the atmosphere is very relaxed
but the the gear yeah you know that creates boundaries to that um and and the time the time given also restricts
yeah but actual environment
mm
mm-hmm
okay
mm-hmm
okay
very good
um what about leadership
i don't know if that means like if i did a good job or something
i don't really know
yeah well well i mean my sense on that is sort of what kind of guidance and direction encouragement
from like your personal coach person and stuff like that do you think maybe
yeah from and you as well i think just sort of acting as team leader
okay
um yeah i think i think it's i think it's good
excuse me
i mean my personal views on on leadership is that effective effective leadership sort of um gives people a certain room for freedom and delegation
but then to come back with something that they take great ownership and
mm-hmm
you know innovative thought with
in in reality i think here the the different elements of leadership such as the the original b briefing and then the personal coach and the and then you know having having you with your the meeting agenda is actually quite a quite a quite a con confining framework to work within
and so it is leadership almost to the point of sort of disempowering the the the team member so
uh-huh okay
but it's not bad leadership it's just sort of s fairly strong you know
it turns it turns the individual into more of like a um sort of a predetermined mechanism as opposed to a sort of a free
so you think maybe a little too controlling or
yeah oh yeah without without a doubt
i think controlling is not the right word i think the interactions are very structured
yeah maybe not co confining
i think structure is probably what you're saying that each individual is structured to one particular task and one parti rather than controlling
yeah
yeah yeah
mm-hmm mm-hmm
okay
i don't think there's a sense of control 'cause all the decisions have been made in terms of a
mm-hmm
mm-hmm
like a consensus right we go around and we think about it
mm-hmm mm-hmm
but that you know process actually says you have to do it in a certain way
uh-huh
mm-hmm mm-hmm
mm-hmm
okay
it doesn't tell you you know some ways that you might wanna be a bit more creative in terms of the process you know not the
mm
mm-hmm mm-hmm
yeah
okay uh what about teamwork
um did you wanna comment craig
uh reckon that was a bit hard because we could only discuss things in the meeting
yeah
yeah
if we could just go up to somebody outside the meeting and have a quick talk with them that would've been a lot easier
yeah
okay
fully agree
i think you tried to use the common share folder to to to to communicate
but um it just comes back to us so slow in the email um it it doesn't have a you know a messenger will go
yeah
mm
did uh did you guys get the email i sent you
yeah
not just yet
yeah
oh that's alright
yeah got the email
i was wondering if that got there okay
okay
okay um so um to s to to summarize the teamwork issue saying that if we could communicate outside the meeting
you know just like quick questions quick thoughts whatever it probably would be bit easier
yeah
yeah in it
i think the tools that they were given the tool set that were given to us are fancy but they don't support collaboration i think that's the word
mm-hmm mm-hmm mm-hmm exactly
they don't support the team working together you know they're still very individual tools
oh right okay
yeah i mean if you
yeah i mean sort of taking upon that idea
w the way i see this i is that it's uh the the s the structure in which we've we've approached this whole task is quite contrary to the p principle of teamwork because the the tasks were d d sort of um divided
and then the work went on in isolation i i don't know what you guys did while you were together maybe that was a bit different
mm
but um yeah but um but actually if you if you imagine not entire the completely same task given to us but us said okay
we had play doh fun
first thing we have to do is come up with um let's say um a design concept
and we sit here together and do it well that's what teamwork is
yeah
to s to say okay go off and don't talk to each other it's actually p sort of predisposes you to quite the contrary of teamwork
yeah
okay
um not that we haven't done i think the best we could have done
okay
i'm not dissatisfied with it
right uh anything else to say on teamwork at all
no not really
okay um what about the you know how we used the whiteboard the digital pens the projector stuff like that
um did anybody think anything was like really useful anything was pretty un f
mm-hmm
unsupportive
i think the whiteboard for me is the kind of thing i would use all the time
but it's um not quite as useful as to us as it could have been maybe just in the way that we we use it
in the sense that once we have an idea out there or while work was going on in between meetings
that could have been up on a board uh you know as opposed to in like in text
mm
um and then we could then keep our ideas sort of building on that
i know that people who design cars and you know in aviation they quite often just have a simple like fibreglass prototype and it's completely you know um abs abstract from the final product
mm-hmm
but they use it as a kind of a context to sort of walk around and puzzle and and point and discuss and and and in a way everybody's as we discuss things in the in theoretically and out of our notebooks
yeah
and point at
yeah
we're just we're actually just each of us discussing something that's in each of our own minds
it wasn't until we had this here you know
yeah
like at one point i peeked across and looked at craig's paper and i'm like now i know what he's thinking 'cause i saw his book
ah
but the b the b whiteboard could've actually been this kind of continuing um
so do you think producing a prototype earlier in the process woulda been a good idea
think could be yeah
i think um the the focus of it a lot was the powerpoint as opposed to the to the whiteboard
yeah
yeah yeah
and i think that m um is also does you know hinder us and things i think
yeah
yeah yeah
mm-hmm
it will be cooler to have the whiteboard rather than the the powerpoint
mm-hmm
or maybe the whiteboard and the powerpoint in the same place you know in the centre of the
yeah
yeah yeah
okay
yeah because the powerpoint was provided to us while we had time to prepare whereas i can imagine if i'd been encouraged to use paintbrush
for example or whatever i would've actually used it um 'ca you know
alright
just 'cause that's sorta how we what we were set up to to use while we had our time
okay uh
i think that there were too many powerpoints in the meetings
mm-hmm
yeah
'cause the plug in and the plugging spent we spent a lot of time doing that
yeah
yeah
and a lot of the information on the powerpoints i don't think you know we needed to actually it could have
yeah
no not quite
we could have gone through it verbally especially my slides i felt that they just you know as opposed to having to present them
yeah
yeah
okay
yeah
what about the digital pens did you find them easy enough to use
yep clunky
sure yeah
oh they're a bit clunky
agreed
yeah
yeah
yep
clunky okay
mm
um
having to tick it before you go off was a bit hindering as well
mm
'cause you're half way through a thought and then you run out of paper and then you have to jump
yeah
i know i think at the very start of today i like wrote a whole load of stuff
yeah
didn't click note on one then went back and wrote one tiny wee thing on the another page
but then did click note and so i'm quite worried that i've just written over the top of it or something
hmm
hmm
mm-hmm mm-hmm
but they'll have my paper anyway um and haven't done that since
hmm
but i think the pen is v is very intuitive everybody knows how to use it we don't have to worry
mm-hmm mm-hmm mm-hmm
yeah yeah
so i think the pen's good
it's about the best thing
and o on the topic of the technology
it just occurred to me that we actually didn't need to move our computers because each computer has all of the files
yeah
it just occurred to me that they all
yeah we only needed one computer and
we only actually needed one computer
yeah that's true
if there had been a fifth that coulda just been sitting there ready to go the whole time
good point
and the computer may not um be conducive to a meeting because um you tend to look at your computer and wanna have the urge to check something
yeah
yeah
yeah
yeah
you know it's useful but
do you think the computers just provide distraction in a meeting
i think too many computers are just distracting
yeah
okay
um
i know i i like to have things written down in front of me actually
mm-hmm
like a lot of the stuff that was emailed to me i ended up you know like writing down there or something so i could look at it really quickly and not have the distraction of all of that
yep
mm-hmm
yep
mm-hmm
um i don't know about anybody else
mm-hmm
um what else uh any wh i do i'm not really sure what they're looking for when they say new ideas found
um i don't know is could you think of like anything else that would have been helpful today at all
is this for the project or
well the w main one for me is that uh the process
na in a natural f context would not have been interrupted by this necessity to discommunicate ourselves from each other
mm
so that's kind of a new idea for me is like just sort of that idea
yeah if we just had uh
well you know it's kind of s hard to keep f working forward on a team a team based project when when you're told you must now work away from your team
mm-hmm
yeah i i dunno i think it was quite good that we had time limits on the meetings because they really could have run on and like my experience with meetings is that they really do
oh yeah
and you can spend a lot of time talking about the only thing is though like when we had our meeting about the conceptual design
yeah yeah
i thought there maybe another fifteen minutes would have been useful there but um yeah
mm-hmm mm-hmm mm-hmm
i really thi i i think maybe if we'd like all been working in the one room
and they just said you know like every hour or something everybody make sure yo you know just have a have a short meeting and then just c just to have like something written down
mm-hmm
mm-hmm
mm-hmm
just like you know a a milestone if you like um rather than having meetings but
there you go
hmm
um so in closing i haven't got my five minutes to go
thin oh there it i five minutes to go
wonderful
okay um are the costs within the budget yes they are
and is the project evaluated yes it is
so now celebrate
great
so it
and we have ninja homer
so now we
oh yeah
well apparently now i write the final report
do we know what the other ones are
what are you guys doing now
i i don't know
you dunno
oh wow
hmm
that is lovely
hey yeah i said ninja homer
what did you call it
ninja homer
see it looks like homer simpson
huh-huh
but it's electronic so it's made in japan
so is that j is that just is that just a logo or does it do anything
logo
yeah it's just a logo
just a logo and then like ninja homer right okay
huh
ninja homer
mm
the the red is supposed to represent the whatever else you wanna print on the side of it
mm-hmm
i think it's quite nice
fashion technology or something
you can wear homer you can throw homer when you're frustrated doh
hmm-hmm hmm
oh no that's cool it's got i'm kind of i'm slightly gutted that we couldn't get plastic and rubber i think that would have been nice
hmm
it's clunky
yeah yeah
ah well maybe from now on real reaction should give us more money
mm-hmm
oh i did learn something new play doh is useful
hmm
play doh s
no it is it is
it is useful and in in in in in in in um conceptualizing in being creative
huh
huh
really
'cause like you say it's something you can put your hands on and feel and touch and get a sense for
yeah
yeah
like we were playing with the play doh and the ideas came with the play doh rather than with everything else
did they
you might wanna write that down
yeah
it's just i'm just fiddling with the play doh and i'm going yeah yeah it's kinda cool
okay
play doh
no it's true yeah
guess i'd forgot how good s play doh smells
hmm
yeah it smells funny doesn't it
and some play dohs are actually i think edible aren't they
um
no all play doh is edible
yeah like the stuff for i think it has to be yeah
i think they're all non toxic 'cause it's aimed for like two year olds
it's just wheat it's the stuff that your mom could make with preservatives and uh
wow hmm
yeah um so to wha what are your summarising words about play doh
it's helpful to the creative process
huh
um it engages all your senses not just your sight but your sense of feel your sense of touch
okay
yep
and it helps you to understand
taste
dimension as well
yeah
i think that that's very helpful because it it starts to pop up whereas on a piece of paper on a computer on a board
yeah
yeah
mm-hmm yep
um even with a three d. graphic thing it still it requires a lot of yeah tangible that's a nice word
yeah
yeah it's not very tangible
yeah
mm-hmm
mm-hmm mm-hmm mm-hmm
it becomes tangible
mm-hmm
tangible
okay uh
mm
i don't know if there's anything else we needed to discuss
nope
that that's about it really
just sit still i guess for a little while
do we retreat to our to continue our
i think we could probably do it here as long as we don't collaborate
um
r reporting or what i
well i dunno
um i'm sure the little uh the little thing'll pop up any minute now
can we turn off the microphones
yeah yeah if the meeting's over then yeah i guess so
okay well i think we're ready to begin
right my name's adam duguid we're here because of real reaction um we have in the group
oh ebenezer ademesoye
would you like me to spell that
s
um yeah go for it mate
um n. e. z.
n. e. z.
e. r.
ebenezer
and your role is
i'm the marketing expert
you're the marketing expert okay
next we have
tarik rahman
t. a. r. i. k.
t. r. i. k.
and your role in this is
industrial designer
industrial designer
and lastly we have
uh dave cochrane
and you're going to be the user interface is it
user interface defin designer yes
designer
okay
right
this is the agenda for today's meeting
as you can see w opening acquaintance tool training project plan discussion and closing
um we already got n through opening and partially through acquaintance
so the reason we're here we're gonna design a new remote control as you probably all know
the very broad overview is original trendy and user friendly
course we'll have to go into a bit more um detail than that
but uh personally i think that the original is gonna be a very key aspect to this design
um there's a lot of remote controls out there anyway so we're gonna need something that's really gonna set it apart
this is how today seems to be going to work
we're gonna have the three kay phases as you've probably already been told the functional architectural and the detailed design
um
first one's gonna be covering the user requirement spec technical functions working design
second seems to be conceptual components properties materials and the last one is a detailed analysis of our design so far
of course you've all got the similar emails i believe right
what can i say
ebenezer you wanna have a you wanna draw your favourite animal
sure
whiteboard
'kay
s okay
i will make this quick since we don't have much time
um
'kay so it's not the best picture in the world
here we have an elephant
first point begins with an e. same like ebenezer
also elephants have a very good memory much like myself
and i can't remember back when i used to live back in nigeria but i think i used to have a pet elephant
so elephants are big strong and gentle and they have great memories and they begin with the letter e. just like ebenezer
brilliantly done
thank you
thank you
tarik would you like to have a shot at a bit of artistry
oh
oh um you can clip them to your belt
oh oh i think you ga
do we take them off
oh right okay
you should also l um have your the lapel mic on as well
the little
ah ha
the the
oh that's good we can clip them on
okay
yeah there was this microphone as well that you
now where do i put the
just um somewhere
yep the it's just across there that's it
yep
is this supposed to be clipped as well
i think so
yeah
it'll follow you if you
yeah
there you go
you can probably just stick it in your pocket for now i wouldn't worry too much
should have good range
uh destroying your elephant here
uh here we have a tiger
uh
i've always loved tigers
they're just they're big they're biggest cats
uh i did a project on cats in the wild when i was a kid and uh it was my favourite cat
just 'cause it was looks the best the stripes orange
my dad used to talk about he's from bangladesh so he used to tell me all about them when he was when i was a kid
and uh they're just the most feared of of uh animals in the wild
so uh that's why i like them
didn't say an anything about me really but
excellent thank you very much
dave if you'd like to uh
have a dash
um
um the monkey um
the one f uh in fact this is a somewhat oblique reference in fact to uh well my i have a three uh three y year old daughter who h who who who is affectionately known as miss monkey
um monkeys have attitude
which i think is a good thing
and i mean fr and from uh from the point of view of sort of the study of human evolution they and other primates are terribly interesting
um so i like monkeys
and and th th th th thi thi this one seems to have perhaps more attitude than most
cheers
hardly what i'd call the best drawing in the world but it'll do for now
also not quite as feared as your average tiger but uh cats are one of my favourite animals they're very independent
they're snotty as hell at the best of times and uh what can you say you got to love those qualities in an animal
right
i think we've all managed to master the whiteboard there by looks of it so on to it
project finance
as you can see twelve point five euros per unit
that's not a terrible lot as far as i'm aware and we're hoping to sell them for twenty five
if we're aiming for fifty million euros we're gonna have to be selling an awful lot of them
oh that was profiting that was an amount so that's the amount made okay
yep
well fifty million and if you're making twelve point five euros on each one then awful lot need to be sold
yeah
okay
now we better actually just get on with the uh the meat of the project
so i'm gonna guess that we've all used remote controls
any ideas of where you think a new remote control could go into this market
well one thing i'm aware of is
th there uh um at the sort of v very high price end of the market there's there's a em emerging market for sort of touch screen l. c. d. remotes that can be uh programmed in m much more sophisticated ways than sort of conventional models
so you get the sort of you get um you you can redesign the interface to your own needs you can programme in macros
and you get a much greater degree um um i mean you get in these sort of three in one five in one whatevers
but you can get integration between the different uh the the the diff the different things that it's designed to control to a much greater extent
and you can have one uh you know one macro to turn the uh you know turn the t. v. to the right channel
get the uh re uh rewind the tape in the v. c. r. and get it to play once it's rewound for instance
okay
um b it occurs to me there might be a niche for uh for a remote that aimed towards some of that sort of functionality but using a just conventional push button design
and therefore putting it into a um well much lower price bracket
okay yeah tha that's true with the price range we're looking at going for a touch screen would probably be possibly out of our yeah
absolutely prohibitive yeah
oh
but you think uh again something to control multiple units in uh a simple fashion
yeah i mean i wouldn't like to say you g i mean you get ones that you can switch between multiple units
but something that could um operate between multiple units in a more integrated fashion
some and ideally something into which it would have some at least limited facility for um running macros
would the the idea something along the lines of one on button would turn on say the video recorder
the t. v. maybe the sound system as well all in one go is that kind of
for instance um let's say oh oh um
or um you know you pr uh you press uh say the play button for the d. v. d. player and it turns the t. v. on and onto the right channel as well
um
okay that sounds like a a good strong idea
'kay
um
any takes on this
well um i've noticed that uh gaming c is becoming quite popular with television um when i was younger we used to e play games using our cable
using the cable subscribed the cable providers but our remote controls would get worn out really easily
mm-hmm
and the remote control was not a great kind of keyboar um keypad for playing games
so perhaps one that was more um
okay
specialised for game playing or interactive television
they they've recently brought out this new remote control for people to set their favourite channels or um to record things
instead of people entering in what time things start
you simply stri slide a bar to say what time it begins and slide another bar to say what time it ends you know that's
okay
yeah i've heard i've seen the bar code design before yeah
mm
mm-hmm
yeah it's it's taken out the
y you don't have to be uh really clever to use a remote control
i think for gaming you know you want you want some big buttons for up down left and right shoot
uh you wanna be able to change angles in interactive television so you need buttons to change the television angle the camera angles and stuff like that
okay well we're beginning to run out of time now so we've got a couple of ideas we can we'll have to work fast
'kay
yeah
um alright as you can see we've got thirty minutes until the next meeting so we'll have to try and decide on some of the basic functionality
um how the user interface might work
that'll be a key aspect especially if the idea of um some kind of macros facility because you have to program it
you have to have a lot of response back or at least some kind
mm-hmm
um
and we're gonna maybe n try and have to figure out
what the user wants uh
what the user wants yes
okay
um right
has anybody got anything they'd like to add at this stage anything they think that might have been missed so far
well when you're talking about gaming and stuff do you think they should have some sort of
stick on it rather than buttons
oh
okay
like uh control pads you know of games but or is that a bit ridiculous
mm-hmm
i i don't see why not almost everybody is probably used to a console by now and all of them incorporate small keypads on them
in fact even the mobile phones these days are beginning to use them as well so it's probably an interface that most people are used to
yeah
um
and that could allow n easy navigation used as a joystick as well
mm-hmm
the other key feature that uh that would be a good idea built into it is t is is to make something you know fairly sort of ergonomic
something that just fits fits as comfortably as possible into the hand
but of course uh al al also allows for the possibility of a more sort of
slightly unconventional or attractive uh
sha shape for it overall
okay
so small stylish and something that's just a little different
a curve mm-hmm
something sort of sort of sl slightly sort of biomorphic in form
uh which it would need to be to sort of conform to the shape of the hand more efficiently anyway
okay
that's definitely something that we should be able to do quite easily
i would i would have hoped so anyway
um right
i'd say we finish this one up we get started i'll get in
i'll write up what we've um kind of quickly done and i'll get that out to everybody
'kay
yeah
so
okay
um as far as i'm aware we leave the microphones here um unless we get told otherwise and just take the laptops with us
just put it on the deskt desktop
no on the desktop you'll find you should find that there's a project documents link
a well actually just there
project documents yeah
yeah
that's it
if you dump it in there
what's your username
your username
what's your username and password
mm-hmm
sorry
okay
okay
there we go
excellent
right
hopefully that's us ready to uh to go
so
functional design meeting
we'll have to flesh out some of the uh stuff
um
we'll start with the minutes of the last meeting
not a lot thankfully to say
we introduced ourselves discussed the possibility of a macro facility interac interacting the t. v. a bit more um mentioning of bar code
joystick for user manipulation um and ergonomics of the remote control as well
um it's come to my attention the following
teletext has become outdated due to the populat popularity of the internet
remote control should only be used for the t. v.
um
due for uh time to market and possibly also cost issues
um also key is the corporate image should stay recognisable um f uh your colour and slogan of course is down at the bottom there
um
now
just to say quickly uh i would have thought that only being used for a television the macro facility may now not be required
mm
um or at l its functionality would have been of limited use
so to the point in my opinion anyway that it might not be worth pursuing
um if anybody disagrees we can uh definitely say so
um and hopefully we'll just crack on and we'll get everything going
um i'd like to if possible hear from our marketing expert first to help us gain an idea of where we're going to go
'kay
so um i'll just load up your presentation from here if you want
sure
um sh would you like to i'll just do it from here
yep
sorry
uh
is yours the
um try second one maybe
try it yeah maybe
oh sorry
yeah
okay
okay right
oh i thought i put in my last name i guess not but
uh if you that's all right
okay
if you do you want me to just cycle through it for you or
oh yeah that'd be fine that'd be great
yeah
okay
functional requirement by me ebenezer
okay
okay so um we did some research we asked one hundred people their opinions on remote controls
we asked some uh open ended questions just what are your opinions on the remote control
got a lot of re responses and we asked some very specific questions and we got a lot of good feedback
please bear in mind this is only a hundred people so even when the groups are divided into fifteen to twenty five
twenty five to thirty five there's only maybe ten people fifteen people in each group
okay
okay
so we got some the bad stuff we got remotes are often lost
i often lose my remote control the back of the couch some place
and even if it's not lost permanently it takes me a few minutes to find it
most buttons are not used any more like you said teletext is outdated now
i remember trying to load a d. v. d. player recently
and there were so many buttons it took me i don't know maybe ten minutes to to go through each button
'cause you have to press the shift button to access the yellow buttons you know there's just a lot of stuff that no one really uses
and if they do not very often
takes too long to master the remote control
i've seen some remote controls that are big they have a lot of buttons
you have to hold down more than one key at one time to do something they're just not great to use
we just got a lot of bad complaints about remote controls people do not like remote controls
some of the good stuff we got
between the age of uh fifteen and twenty five most people would be willing to pay extra for voice recognition software
now don't get excited yet i've got more to say on that
most people'd be willing to pay for that um most people want remote controls to be pretty
they want it to be fancy th they they want it to be different
everybody has a white remote control with black buttons and a red button and a green button not everybody wants that
finally my opinion
yep
the voice recognition thing is cool
and uh voice recognition the software open source software exist already
it's a bit sketchy at some times uh you're not gonna get good always accurate results
but for a very fixed number of words you know you have
how many different words can you have for a remote control up down left right
channel five channel seven you know how many you can't have that many words
for a fixed vocabulary it works quite well
i'm pretty sure people would buy it
but after a while people may wanna return it
because if you have to to say som i mean most people use a remote control for switching to channels
and they say they do that about ninety eight percent of the time
using the remote control ninety eight percent of the time for changing channels and that's for flickering through channels
so if you have to say up up up up
if you have to do that all the time then people might get a bit fed up with that and they may return it
however oh because the voice recognition software exists already
there's no need to spend money on research and development but this does mean the need for microphones in the
in the remote control which is an unusual feature in my opinion
but if we do have the voice recognition thing there's a lot of stuff that you can uh get rid of
see you could there're two options
either you have voice recognition by itself which i think is a bit impractical for like night time if you wanna be watching television and you wanna be quiet
or i don't know you have a visitor coming round and the remote's only trained for you it's a bit impractical to have just voice recognition by itself
so you can have voice recognition and a regular remote
but imagine you got rid of the regular remote part then you can design the remote to look any way you want it to look
because there are no restrictions on physical size
or shape it it could be as fancy as you want it to be
you know it could be like a lollipop or something like that something weird like that
as long as the voice recognition stuff works that's that's fine
okay yep
so we have the three birds we have the design that we have the the fancy bit
right the voice recognition's fancy it's cool it's different it's radical so
and then we have an extra bit i don't remember so i'm pretty sure people will buy the remote
but is it practical to have a voice recognition system in a remote control i think is a big question
um will people
will people be willing to wait for the the period that it'll take to train the remote
'cause i think it will the remote will uh get better over time with the same user user
but for the first week or for the first two weeks are you willing to wait are you willing to have a bad remote control
and uh what if you have visitors come round they stay the night they wanna use the t. v.
they can't use the remote because they speak differently to you
um how do you account for regional accents and stuff like that
uh will people return the remote control
i think a lot of young people will buy the remote control if they have the money you know so
mm-hmm
do our audience have the money but would they return it after a while because it's not as fast as pressing a button it's not a practical
so
if you could uh
these are things i think we should consider
i think it's cool
sor if you could speed it up a bit yeah
i'm sorry
if you could uh speed it up a bit please yeah
sure
i'm about to end yeah
sorry
cool
i think it's cool
but there are definitely some considerations
okay
so yeah
excellent
right
um
hear from the user interface designer now i think might be an idea
okay
um you've got your presentation now is it on the is it
how did where did where did you get all your in information
yeah it's in the it's in the folder yeah
okay
there was uh a website uh
oh
technical functions
right here
ah okay
g i started making stuff up then i got an email saying
mm
no
yeah
okay
okay this is a brief run through of the um of the technical functions of the remote
as um is uh the the the presentation is uh already slightly obsolete because i had in mind something that would uh be i be aimed at controlling multiple devices but uh there's still stuff of relevance
so
okay
press on
i've looked at looked at a num uh couple of other uh remote control models just for an idea of basic design principles
um
and wasn't really satisfied by what i saw i have to say so this is more sort of springboard for uh how these could be improved on
um um basically the job of the device is to send commands to an appliance in this case the television set
um to save you getting off your backside
um and there's two main trends in th in the sort of design practice
on the one hand and this uh this particularly relates to its sort of earliest models where with you know i so so many buttons on it so about the size of the television set
um giving you every possible function that the that the device has the remote control controls
and most of these functions are not going to be used it creates a rather user unfriendly interface
and on the other hand there's a user focused approach that pares things down to just what what is most likely to get used
um
with uh a and a and of course there is a certain amount of sort of loss of function here obviously but mostly that's relatively peripheral functions
and so you go for something that's fairly intuitive to use
and um well f the for the most part for t. v. remote it's uh tha that would be channel control and volume
um and if you if you if you are wanting to incorporate uh control of a d. v. d. v. d. or uh
v. c. r. presumably into that then there's a play pause stop rewind fast forward record so forth
um
my own view is that we should definitely be going for a user focused design
um but uh the pro i think the problem with a lot of the sort of user focused designs that are about is that they sort of make assumptions in advance about what uh what a given user's going to uh want mo want to do from want it to do most
so something that's uh
something that is more programmable
that uh perh perhaps has the full range of functions available to it but you can then specify yourself what you're most likely to want
um so that those are then immediately accessible through fairly minimal number of controls
um i liked ebenezer's idea of including a joystick in that and uh possibly a sort of fairly minimal number of sort of function buttons
and have a disp you then have some sort of basic display on it so that if you're um sort of cha changing from different modes for the device it'll tell you just exactly what uh you know each direction of the uh
of the um joystick's going to do or wha or what each function button's going to do
um this is actually a again slightly taking inspiration off of uh games controllers
mm
you know the playstation control where you have four basic function buttons that are just marked with um distinctive uh geometrical shapes but the and then dependent on what you're doing with it what game and so on um those uh those functions are then sort of further specified
and so it's taking taking the lead from that
um
okay
yeah
that's it
right
um if we could hear from our industrial engineer or designer
yeah
uh i was still working on stuff i hadn't got it finished
um alright
click to save in where do i have to save it
if you look on the desktop you'll find that there's a link to the project folder or project documents
if you save it in there we can open it up from here
um what i've done with it i'm sorry
shit
um
are you finding it okay or
i'm just closing it now
where i've saved it
well like if you go to one uh whichever one you were working yeah and you just click file save as
that's it there yeah
oh right
okay
uh right i'm responsible for working design uh this is basically the inside going on of the
the uh remote control
so we have the energy source we have the user interface this this is what i've seen
uh the sender will push the button the chip will respond uh and then the dig digital signal is sent to the t. v.
so uh
uh if you go to next slide you'll see you'll see uh what do we need on the user interface
do we need uh many buttons or do we need l many light bulbs that could be easier to uh to realise which appliances are on or not
um or would that take too much power would we need more um components in there to supply the power
um the joystick is another thing if we were gonna add that um there'd be more components to deal with that
mm-hmm
um so uh we need to i dunno exactly what
that's the design of the the the layout of the uh electronic design
but um obviously there'll be more details once we've decided what we're putting on the user interface
okay
so that'll be decided i guess
uh and the next slide
oh yeah
um if you go to the next slide then
oh
yeah
i just used the it was a mess uh i was just putting adding it together at the end there
ah don't worry about it at all mate
uh
uh so you have the energy source obviously connected to the chip and the user interface obviously contains everything
you have the switch turn it on infrared bulb
uh will contact the t. v. and will have whatever device or d. v. d. player the bulb will turn on to say it's on
uh so do we need on the control uh different buttons to decide or different light bulbs would it be easier
um i dunno what we should decide on that
okay
well
oh sorry i'm i'm interrupting you
are you is it yeah
no it's finished yeah
okay
right
um right we can probably skip that for now
so we've had some stuff put forward um
along with the new user requirements
um we've had a lot of kind of input i'd say so far
um
i hear what the marketing expert's saying about um voice activated control
however i've got a couple of worries about that
the power required um and the ability to the cost it seems like for uh an embedded system this could cause us issues
cost
mm
um for example you see that there's fairly robust services on uh computers via uh via voice i. b. m. do um drag and dictate
mm-hmm
but these require a lot of memory and usually um state quite advanced processor requirements
um voice activation could be an interesting idea but i think that our ind industrial designer would probably upon some research say that it's maybe not feasible
'kay
um that's just my view right now
mm
however the idea of a joystick and then maybe an l. c. d. which has been kind of put forward so far it's almost like having a small
t. not t. v. to say but if you can control almost all of the functionality from the display
i don't know how much power an l. c. d. would take but it might be quite low
mm
l. c. d. on the remote just telling you what's on or uh interactive l. c. d. or
i uh
well literally um if you can imagine the display maybe slightly larger than um those on a a mobile phone
something where you can read an an um fair amount of information
mm
traverse maybe quite a few menus if we maybe used mobile phones as a good example they usually incorporate they have the keypad
and then evr all the other functionality is usually associated inside by traversing around
mm-hmm
that could be one possibility
um and then we could have like say the common buttons as you say volume control changing channels
mm
i i was thinking that the remote the um sort of default functions for the joystick would be up and down for uh volume left and right for channels
we
do you think that people will get mixed up like they'll be looking at this screen and that screen and then
you know trying to get everything working would it be a bit confusing
um i think probably for the first couple of hours of using it um but you know muscle memory's a wonderful thing um
yeah
mm
and i think and i think that size of uh display was about what i had in mind
um though
i mean i w i would say that uh we could probably probably be required to um mo most of the mobile phone displays you see these days are colour but we should probably try to stick to black and white
i would agree with you
si si simply to keep m keep the unit cost down
um i mean colour could be a sort of subsequent development but uh you know cost a bit of extra money f w w w w w once everyone's got the first
you know oh colour's out we'll have to replace it won't we
mm-hmm
it does nothing extra
that would be my feeling as well i think we could possibly create quite a useful user interface
um now i mean i don't sorry go for it
sure but the idea of a remote with a menu or and a joystick i think like i h if i was in the habit of buying remote controls then i would want one
but i think we don't have a specific audience you know
like what is our target audience what niche are niche are we trying to market and corner
you know you know what i'm saying like for whom is this intended
everybody
i think it could probably be aimed at most people who've used a mobile
and that might be just another way of saying try to target most people
most people yeah
um if we are if we were to follow that avenue
mm
we might be s you know um we're kind of almost relying on their experience with a mobile phone i suppose
mm-hmm
but that does cover a very large section of the people out there
sure
i think that's fair yeah
um i mean i imagine as well that the actual l. c. d. and maybe to a certain extent the joystick as well would be for the additional functionality
mm
which maybe doesn't get used as often
maybe it makes it easy for them to figure out how to um change the channels as in the frequencies and such for reprogramming it
mm-hmm
um and you can still have the main buttons that allow the people to turn the machine on and off d up and down it depends
i mean maybe we have the fol um the joystick as a separate one for the other functions then
that there's just a a small number of as you were saying uh buttons that have already been defined
mm-hmm
so like we go for the nice standard um up and down for and volume control
so that literally anybody can come along pick up the remote and still know what do do
and they can completely ignore most of the functionality which would be for say the o actual owner of the the t. v. and who would normally use the unit
mm-hmm
mm-hmm
mm
i dunno
i th the thing i like about the uh the uh joystick is that uh you you you then basically you can then basically put it i mean for for t. t. for t. v. remote alone
you could put
um i mean there are like i say the the the main things people do with a t. v. remote control is the volume and the channel
you can pack all that onto was onto a single control
mm-hmm
um
but uh but the but then o uh obviously if uh
you know if you i if you wanted to access further functions i you you then get to sort of menu navigation
i mean with things like ch with things like tuning and channels um you know adjusting brightn uh brightness and fiddly things that no one really bothers with
most t. v. s these days actually have menus anyway so this would be a fairly rational way of integra
mm-hmm
integrating the uh the remote with the device it's controlling
um
concern about our market
um if we are i mean most of the uh
of the replacement remote market is sort of remote control rationalisation
um you've got twenty different devices in your living room you want one wo y you want one that'll do the job of all of them
yeah
mm-hmm
mm-hmm
um if all you're replacing is one of the you know however many remotes you have in your living room
um you know you still need separate remotes for everything else
i just think that uh possibly mm
well this is a requirement that we have to stick to i'm afraid this isn't one that i've just arbitrarily decided on
mm
so um this is this is one of the solid ones that has to be obeyed for now
mm
so i can understand your point and i would agree with you but this is our design spec for now
'fraid to say
um
does that um would that include um access to say interactive functions on digital or cable
yeah
i would say so yes because then we have to be able to control the remote boxes and that is a separate unit
um i think that it i would say that the design spec we've been with is for the television only for now
mm-hmm
and until we hear otherwise we should go with just that
hmm
okay specifically television
okay
okay
maybe we'll hear differently but for now
so the joystick is just for differentness
mm
it would be ease of manipulation of certain functions yes
okay
just a thought
um
um maybe then our market should be t. v. manufacturers rather than the public
try and sell it t sell it to them to supply with
um
there is that possibility yes
b however i don't know exactly where we'll be going with that but it might not even be the avenue of the marketing expert
mm
that might be sales who are not in this meeting
mm-hmm
it's just the way i figure it twelve point five euros per unit we have to sell at least like three million or something like that
mm-hmm
not to account for all the the money we waste on remotes that no one buys you know
like if we made a perf if we made a ks for every remote we made someone bought it then we have to sell a lot of remote controls
mm-hmm
we just
is this gonna be enough to to sell
well something else that you brought up was uh the ability to lose a remote which as you said you've done in fact we've probably all done
yeah
um i don't know if it's a gimmick or not
but have any of you ever seen those odd little key rings where if you whistle it will beep and you tell you where it is
i had one of those and my brother and my dad could have beat me up because it it went off all the time accidentally
mm yeah i've seen them
um
well the other option of course is that um the well i was going to say clapping um
the clapping one
um digital telephones uh for example one unit has of course you have to have that base unit
somewhere where there's a button but maybe it's a button that you attach to the t. v.
to a television
mm
something which you when you press that it would beep to give its location away on the remote unit
yeah
and that could be something could um separate us a bit
yeah i think that's a good idea
yeah that's a good idea
and that way because we're attaching what would be a small button to the t. v. again say what
it would be a small transmitter um watch battery type scenario i would say
or something that if it was problems enough you could actually even just um i don't power that might be something that we could look into
yeah
yep
yeah it's uh putting a lot on your shoulders there so i mean that could be something that separates us a bit from the market as well
i think so yeah
so
to go on from here
um we have to decide exactly what we're going to do with the remote
before we leave this meeting it would be best to say this is what we're going this is the design we're gonna try and get
this is how we're gonna make ourselves look unique
do we go for maybe a remote contro uh sorry we're gonna go for a remote control obviously
mm
do we go for a small joystick that would operate say changing channels
up and down and then what another button that would say that it's now being used to manoeuvre round the l. c. d.
mm yeah
we're just saying volume
yeah i think that's
should volume be important in the joystick do you think
we could use say the left and right for changing channels and the up and down for volume and
yeah
for volume
yep
but we have a frequency of how what people use a remote control for most
okay
um power is used like once per hour channel selection is used a hundred and sixty eight per hour
i
mm-hmm
that's by far the biggest one and then teletext is still here that's like fourteen and volume selection
vol
volume selection okay yep the teletext we're gambling with and we're gonna say it's dead the way of the dodo
no yeah okay okay
yeah um
so we well sorry we could maybe even go as far as saying power button small joystick l. c. d.
and then what maybe is it one more button to say that you're using the menu system
and with the possibility of pushing down on the joystick to say okay
so we're having very very few buttons involved but navigation around a menu for most things
actually how
actually i would say maybe two two function buttons the y we're now using the menus button and um and an og and an okay button
i mean certainly something i've found with the joystick on mo the joysticks on mobile phones is that a lot of the time th the device mistakes you trying to move it in one direction or the other for pushing down for okay
okay
okay
or vice versa
and that's really irritating
mm-hmm
um
the o the o the other dis design constraint i think we should bear in mind is that people are you know very much used to using a remote control one handedly
um so we need to make sure that e even with the joystick
you know something that can just sit comfortably in the palm of the hand and have the joystick just controlled by the thumb
okay
so um we're actually that sounds like a rough idea
do we incorporate the idea of trying to f locate the remote control again via a beeping noise
yeah think so
do you mind looking
um
i think because it's so small it might be an uh i mean if we only have like two three buttons it might be essential to have to have that
the ability to locate it again
yeah
so that would require a um transmitter maybe attached to the t. v. just so that it says find me
and what a basically a small microphone um on the actual unit can maybe hide it in the base
light bulb as well no
oh
sorry
so so a small speaker you mean
speaker yeah
some speaker sorry yeah
and a light bulb
no
to flash
no
um
nah you'd see it anyway if you hear it
e us we might be better with the sound possibly we could maybe incorporate
w those little key rings have both so
yeah
th e the true fact considering the cost of an l. e. d. we could just incorporate it anyway
yeah
yeah
the l. e. d. s can be surprisingly bright now
yeah
mm-hmm
mm-hmm
um
blue ones particularly
plus that's a nice wee design touch
so by the sounds of it with what we're suggesting so far
yeah
your design um the user interface is still quite open you could go for quite an interesting design
because we're only going to have a very few key and you've got
mm-hmm
you know a small l. c. d. joystick
e i think it leaves you open to a a potential wide range of shapes something that can make it stand out slightly
mm-hmm
um if you could look into what we've suggested so far the feasibility of um small transmitter
um and such maybe if an l. c. d. screen requires too much power or such
ebenezer um marketing expert
well i can give you the frequency what people what options people use most often
i guess that's gonna be important in the ts defining the the software side of the interface right
you want the stuff
if yeah if you could maybe as well see what people think about the idea of this minimalist approach that we've taken
where of a joystick to control the very basic functions and then the idea of manipulating it like you would a mobile
okay
okay
i don't know how easy that will be within the time frame but could be something we could maybe look into
mm-hmm
sure
sure
okay
um any last comments that anybody would like to put forward
anything that they think has been missed out
bit of a wide open question there of course
mm
feel free to email me if you think that uh we've screwed something up and wanna get it rectified as soon as possible
sure
'kay
right
yeah
so i should just look at um the speaker the speaker and an l. e. d.
and
speaker and l. e. d. for locating um
yeah and a transmitter
transmitter
transmitter
actually one one wee thought about that
um if we do end up trying to market this to television manufacturers then the um then the transmitter could actually be built into the television
getting the external power source yep that's quite true
um and something that we can can easily be adopted at the last minute as well i'd say
yeah
the electronics could be s either placed externally or internally makes no difference to the final product of the actual remote control so that's good
mm-hmm
uses maybe gives us a new potential market
mm-hmm
'kay
you know i think i mean if it w if we get a major television manufacturer to say y oh yeah we'll have that
p
save us the bother then that's you know vast amounts of sales
quite quickly
oh one thing that we've almost not talked about at all my apologies for that um user interface
we also need to maybe get the slogan in here um it's i'm pointing at my laptop what in god
fashion
real reaction and such
so um
the slogan is yeah the slogan's we put the fashion in electronics isn't it
oh sorry
my apologies
no it could well be i've probably missed that
um i think that's l almost the last minute thing we can just incorporate into the actual plastic on top
's also look cool
so i'm not too concerned a that we haven't gone into depth about that
mm
but it might be something you could consider when you're thinking about shapes
in fact we might like to put a slogan on and um possibly the two r. s to signify the company
mm-hmm
mm-hmm
rather than real reaction
mm
yeah
i thought the uh the d the double arc could perhaps uh be the uh the enter button
sounds good
and i'd say that that's us for now
okay
alright yeah
crack on
okay so we'll start off with a quick overview of the minutes
i think to sum up the last meeting would be to say um the requirements that we've um set out
those are we were going to go for what seemed to be a fairly minimal design based on uh a small joystick
l. c. d. and a couple of other buttons for navigation um with power being i suppose one of the main single purpose buttons
um we were also going to use novelty of being able to locate the remote control again via a small transmitter with any luck
the idea to try and separate us and also because of the minimal design
um looks like we'll be able to be fairly adventurous in the actual physical shape of our remote control with any luck
um that pretty much sums up the last one
so we'll just crack on um like to maybe start with the industrial designer if it's possible
uh uh okay
um uh the con today is the concep today
i'll just
this uh meeting is the conceptual design phase and is um
sorry about this
and is to cover things like um what the parts might be made of um
can we uh outsource these from elsewhere um will we have to construct any items ourselves
uh i have a presentation i just saved it in the uh the folder
yeah okay well i'll just uh i'll load it up then
um
which one do y
uh
oh interface concept
yeah that's me
uh
that's you
we've got trend watching that's you
it's uh
components design
components design
okay
alright
so
uh
the case uh le that's what i wrote first of all could be plastic our plastic
uh but later on we found out that um it can be rubber as well or titanium or even wood
so uh we decide what it's gonna be
probably plastic
uh
we need the infra red transmitter
get that off the shelf
uh joystick we'll probably if we're gonna use it um could be
plastic w or rubber even as well
um
if you go on to the next slide
uh
if you go on to f uh findings it's like two or three slides down
right
okay
so this is what i found we can use
uh
three different types of batteries
um
can either use a hand dynamo or the kinetic type ones you know that they use in watches or else uh a solar powered one
okay
um
now the kinetic one we've 'cause that's the ones where like you the movement causes it
cost is
yeah
yeah
um the bat uh the battery for a a watch wouldn't require a lot of power would be my one query
is a kinetic one going to be able to supply enough power
mm
there's also a watch moves around a great deal more
do you think
uh
yeah
w
yeah i don't think it would
um
and solar cells i dunno about that
yeah
uh
we should probably just use conventional batteries
um
just like in usual remote controls
which i suppose as well would allow us to go off the shelf again you'd say
um
yeah
um
and these are three different types of or two different types three different types of shapes you can have
uh one is a flat one and then more original ones are single curved one or one with a double curved
um the materials are tha there as you can see but uh you can't have a titanium one for a double curved uh which would be
titanium the really strong metal titanium
yeah and light
is it not also it's expensive
uh i think so as well yeah
they make mountain bikes out of that don't they
um
um
so it's really light as well
curious
um i don't know if you'd be able to off the top of your head or not the single curved and double curved
would you be able to give an example
um
um could you maybe draw something
t yeah
i you don't doesn't have to be perfect it's just 'cause i'm not quite sure if i understand the difference between the two
uh
well
for a curved well i was thinking to f for to sit in your the palm of your hand
uh maybe like this with the uh joy pad here
joystick here
and maybe
um
an okay button around here so that the thumb can uh use it quite easily
um i don't exactly
double curved
it probably means this is probably double curved
uh whereas a single curved would be
like that
i guess
or not necessarily
so it might literally just be okay
two curves
yeah like that
whereas this is two curves
um
so i guess that's what they mean by uh double curve
alright
um which obviously it looks better than the single curve but uh you can't have it in titanium which is
uh
a nice material
uh
mm
and for the buttons um it can have the scroll wheel which they use in mouses for com p. c. s
uh but
um it requires a
more expensive chip to use and if you wanna use l. c. d. it's even more expensive
so you have to decide there's trade offs there
um
if you want the buttons to be oh yeah if you have a double curve uh control and it's rubber then you have these rubber buttons as well
but you're gonna ha i reckon you're gonna have to have uh key a number keypad anyway for the amount of channels these days
you wouldn't want to just have to scroll through all the channels to get to the one you want
you wanna enter just the number of it if you know it
so
um i reckon we're gonna have to have a number keypad anyway
do you think
okay that was definitely something we can talk about
um so you've got a little bit about the the chip that we might require as well
yeah
so
depends where
gonna spend the money
if you want the f fancy l. c. d. display
um do you have any idea so far
like when we're saying that we'd need an advanced chip for an l. c. d. does that in shoot the cost up by a drastic amount
or
need an advanced chip for the l. c. d.
is that did i
well i think compared to say just pressing buttons
yep
advanced like three eight six advance
if you press a button that sends a certain transmission through the infra red whereas i think if we're controlling the l. c. d. we definitely require a much more powerful chip
okay
just compared to the chip you would use for pushing buttons i think is the the point being made
okay sure
mm
if i've not over stepped
yeah
yeah i
okay um should i go on or go back
um
mm if we only have twelve pounds fifty
twelve euros not even twelve pounds
twelve euros what's that like eight pounds or something like that nine pounds
well we'd also be relying on the um the bulk buying in producement and such
okay that's good point
i assume
we have to look into the costs of those
so sorry
uh the previous slides just explain what's in the internal components of the uh remote control
if you go to the one before that uh so it just says what it does
translate the key press into an infra red signal and this is received by the t. v.
uh the chip just needs to detect the signal or detect the key press and then uh it'll send it to the tr the amplifier
okay
and uh then the next slide just shows how the uh copper wires
uh interact with the buttons the rubber buttons uh
to uh get sent to the chip
so that's just how the control works inside
um we have to decide on what
buttons we're gonna use
okay
um
so in the information that you've been supplied how feasible would you say that the idea of using an l. c. d. looks
um
i think we can do it if uh we use conventional batteries and not have solar cells or kinetic
um and then
maybe use single curved uh case
because we might need it to be curved for the uh
thumb to use the joyst joystick easily
um
and then you'll need the advanced chip obviously for the l. c. d.
um i mean that sounds like quite a good requirement to me
um conventional battery would seem to make sense
um i'm not sure if there's any cost differences between single and double curved and i'm i don't know about anybody else
mm-hmm
but plastic or rubber as a traditional form of casing would seem to be a good way forward
mm
um i'm actually gonna be bold and go oo go straight for rubber um for reasons i'll go into uh in more detail
okay
i also have a preference for rubber
okay well um
based on my research
yeah well will we move on to user interface and yeah
um sorry as long as were you
mm
yep i'm finished
yeah
okay
um and d d d interface concept
yep
now i'm gonna have to work between the uh the slides and the uh
yeah
and the white board 'cause i actually i have some fairly concrete things
this time
uh um i was given a
an h. t. m. l. file giving um various ideas from uh from other previous remote control designs and pretty much decided to just dump them all
i wasn't very impressed by them and they didn't seem to re uh nothing i saw seemed to meet the sorts of design specifications that we're going for today
um so what i ra rather than looking at other remotes uh ra oomp be better to simply look at the human hand
um and try and f um and try and figure out a way of laying out the elements we've already decided on
um so that if r a if so that the finger is e each finger or thumb is wherever it needs to be already
um so uh next slide if you please
um and what we've basically decided on was the the um the joy uh the joystick
two function buttons and the l. c. d. just keep it paired down to the absolute minimum
i don't actually think we need the um the numeric keypad because if you m because one of the menus that we could have available um v via via the l. c. d. is one where you scroll through channels
so if there's something f and be bear in mind since this isn't meant to work for um
digital
ah okay
f f f for di for digital or um or for or for cable whatever you're basically looking at four or five terrestrial channels
and then um your v. c. uh and then the channel through your v. c. r. and or d. v. d. player
and or um box
so it's not i'm not really excessively concerned about that
you must have two two modes basic mode where um the joystick's uh left right left right for channels
up down for volume um and the uh uh and the menu mode for uh further functions
um now the reason i was particularly interested in using rubber for this is that if we're going to have a highly ergonomic design
um it needs to be ergonomic for left or right handed people
um so you
can i just jump in slightly there
mm-hmm
that would suggest the double curved design's probably going to be most appropriate then
yes absolutely
okay
um basi basically what i basically what the what be having um i would say the the whole thing articulated at two points
so that if you if you're handing it from a lef uh left or right handed user you can adjust it so that the um the l. c. the l. c. d. and the uh
the joystick would be in the right place
and also this is a rather nicer de uh design gimmick that the the um you know the whole thing you know it should have sort of organic feel to it that it should be
mm
you know soft to touch and
can be moved around all nice
um okay on to on to the next uh to the next slide
okay
um yeah
just to let you know we'll probably be quite tight for time as well because i think you've probably got a lot you'd like to say i guess
okay
yeah 'kay basically um
i can add pretty pictures to this
the um
assuming the hand the hand to be in about sort of this position um hol uh holding the remote
the um the joystick unit should rest over the uh the joint of the f of the uh four finger so that it's directly accessible for the thumb
um and it would need t there would need to be a it would need to be articulated just below that so that it could be switched around for uh left or right handed users
so
you then have a grip section that can be more or less the same irrespective of handedness
you just have big two big buttons that cover most of the area so it can in the upper part
one for the four finger one for the middle finger
um and that
is this the joystick
th this part here is the joystick
this would be the actual grip
probably where you'd want to have the battery as well
okay
that would be probably the bulkiest part
and you then have at the uh at the bottom the l. c. d. and this would need to be articulated as well
and basically i'd want this to rest here right at the base of the wrist
so it would fit just nicely in the hand
and again this part could be
rotated so it can
so so so that it can be adjusted to either left or right handed user
um
so the t uh the top function button in basic mode would be the on off switch and menu mode would be the enter button
and then the bottom function buttons switches between between modes
um now programming it actually thi this is one thing i've found with um the replacement remote control
programming them can be a right pain
so i thought th the simplest way around that would be to have um
a cable to connect it to the computer some some fair iv fairly fairly simple software on the computer just so that you on your computer just so that you could um pr program it at a rather in a rather more comfortable interface
and you could download programs for it from uh for uh t. v. s from all sort of main manufacturers
um though you i it would be necessary to have uh have a m uh have a ha have a mode for programming it without the computer
uh just in case there are there are still people left out there who don't have them yet
mm
um
but uh
yeah
okay
that's that's my idea
excellent right
mm
um uh
'kay
file open
we go
trend watching
okay
so uh to gather my research two basic methods
we compared uh whether people want the remote control to do a lot of stuff or they want it to look cool
and then we we research uh fashion trends in europe what's what's the new black you know as it goes
okay
next slide please
uh we found in order of importance people want the remote control to look cool more than they want it to to be cool
as in they want it to do a lot of good s they want it to look like it does a lot
and if it does do a lot that's a bonus but they don't care so much you know
they want it to be that's sounds a bit like a contradiction
technology technical technologically innovative
people want it to be that but s still they care more about the way it looks than what it does
so like the interface is really important
and easy to use
it it just so happens that uh from the second point to the third point is twice as important i mean the second point is twice as important as the third point
people want it
i is it has to be cooler than easy to use you know if it has the newest features
even if it's difficult to use prefer it to have the newest features
and if it's easy to use that's a bonus
the fashion now this is seems a bit odd to me
but fruit and veg is the new is the new black for furniture for clothes for shoes
how that relates to a remote control i don't know
but i i see i come on to that in the next in the next slide
spongy
i've als i've been saying everything's the new black
well spongy's the new black as well
so we have the choice between rubber and plastic
if it's the type of rubber that you can squeeze you know it's spongy then can i skip the rest
oh yeah i forgot to mention that
the uh rubber material is the type of stress ball material not just normal rubber
okay
okay so kinda spongy material
forgot to say that
so um so my personal opinion
okay
um we want something fancy and techni technologically innovative obviously
but what we what we need is something that looks like it's from the future that looks cool that's that's different
you know that's everyone has a white remote control black remote control you need something cool
like titanium is cool but it's expensive
and maybe it's a bit of overkill for a remote control
um now the fruit and veg options either we we go in that direction or we stay totally away from it
um i mean the research did come up with fruit and veg so maybe it is important for it's the up to the interface guy
so if we stay away from it s you know stay away from it
but if we're gonna go along with it then it doesn't necessarily have to be like an apple or something like that or a kiwi fruit
it could be something like
i say potato peeler but i'm sure you guys have a have a much cooler idea than i do
so i think cool is the key
few questions about a spongy remote control
i've never seen one before
i've seen plastic remote controls
i think maybe they were
i don't know back in the day when they first came up with remote controls they had a reason for it being
mm-hmm
sturdy you know
for being strong and sturdy
so um if we want something strong and sturdy i say stay with plastic or titanium but if we go with spongy
we can stress that you can drop this as many times as you want it doesn't matter it's spongy material it's not gonna break you know
i just don't know how the l. e. d. and the lights are gonna fit into a spongy material because it's not gonna be completely squeezable
so how do things fit it
and if we are gonna use spongy we can say it's long lasting you know it's damage resistant and stuff like that so
so just to summarise people want stuff that's cool that's that looks like it's cool
and if it is cool then that's a bonus doesn't have to be um people like fruit and veg
we can either go down that alley or stay totally away from it
people like spongy material
if we're gonna use spongy material we have to think of how practical it is and how we can further promote that idea
and also this was this year
so things change all the time every year you know they they always talk about this year this is the new black
well next year something else is gonna be the new black and we're stuck with last year's fruit and veg type stuff
mm-hmm
'kay
okay
that's me
well um i would say that the most you could probably hope for is gaining a year's lead on most people anyway
you always have to bring out new designs so if we can get next year then that's possibly a good place to start anyway
mm-hmm
um
seems like a a lot of the components could be off the shelf so i don't exactly what cost would be incurred
um i can see your point about the number keypad
but i've i would say that we can probably incorporate it into the menu system if you need to do traversal of a large number of channels
yeah
mm-hmm
my feeling would be that even if at a later date this was to be taking control of um boxes as well um having the use of the l. c. d. and the joystick would probably allow you to manipulate enough channel numbers for you to be
yeah actually if you've got a lot of channels the number keypad can be quite annoying as well
becau it's you know if you're trying to remember what uh you know what number's the discovery channel or whatever
that's a good point
it's just irritating
you can incorporate names into the menu
mm-hmm
but if you h but but but if you have a me but if you have a menu structure then you can sub group them
okay
even news music
so you
okay
like they do on uh sky digital kinda
yeah
yeah
so what it looks like to me is we'll use a large number of standard components um
say something like um lithium ion battery the kind that you find in most um small hand held devices now
um
looks like we going for a double curved design
um i don't know what cost implications there are in that
um looks like we're pretty much decided on some kind of flexible rubber
though i'd have to say depending on how flexible it is we might need to have some kind of inner frame
yeah i i would say definitely
i mean i mean i mean the the idea of having it sort of articulated i th there would be basically two points of articulation
w um one below and one above the m the uh the main sort of grip
do you think there's any way we could maybe remove the articulation
so
i can see why it looks appealing but it could be a weak point in um the structure do you think
that would be a worry of mine
mm
if you're going with the fruit and veg thing looks like a banana
i d i don't thi i don't think that it would be a a structural weakness
f if you wanna design it that way
i mean if you have a firm s sub structure you can then incorporate articulation into that
if you then have a sort of outer skin of mm flexible spongy rubber then you have something that is you know very much you know
organic and i think would look rather co i mean mi rather cool
i mean my drawing there doesn't doesn't do it justice
it makes it makes it look more a little bit more like a vibrator than a than a uh than a remote control but uh
yeah we won't add that functionality
okay
course not
however one interesting point is i don't know how serious you were there
but we if we take some of the ideas why don't we make the damn thing yellow to incorporate the des the colour of the logo
yeah
sure yeah
okay
i dunno
it's an certainly a different colour from your average um
mm-hmm
make it harder to lose as well
yeah
that's true
sure
was there anything in your research
the noise for when you lose the banana um f yeah
for when you lose the remote control it could be like a a monkey noise or something like that rather than a standard beep beep
y you know you lose the monkey the banana
monkey
y you lose the banana you press a button and you hear like monkey screams or something like that to direct you towards the banana
i th uh i mean if it i think that's something that could perhaps be programmable though maybe have monkey as default
s oh i was gonna talk about the programmable remote control
um
now i think it'd be cool if you had one remote control that could work with all t. v. s
you know you s you click a button and it finds the frequency that
works with your particular television
mm-hmm
but why you'd need to program it like as as a standard feature i i don't know
well basi basically the um for f for uh i mean e each manufacturer will have a partic will have a particular command set that uh the t. v. responds to
mm-hmm
it's not simply a matter of frequency
yeah
so um
usually what's done is you have this big booklet full of different possi you'll have all of them sort of programmed in to the uh remote
and you'll have this little booklet of codes you then find your um ma uh find your manufacturer and try the different codes that
mm-hmm
mm-hmm
come under that manufacturer's name 'til you find the right one
that's because televisions they don't give the remote control any type of feedback when you send it
it's
yeah that's right
okay
so that's that's quite annoying and we probably would still have to do that
but if we had um some sort of hook up to your computer as an option then if you've got a computer you can avoid that
rather irritating thing
an interesting point is that if the person doesn't have the computer we can still make the process easier because instead of having to look up codes
maybe we can have it that one of the options they have is that they look up the name of the company on the l. c. d. and then they maybe look up different names of um different actual units that have been produced
yeah
yeah
or we have the remote control just go through them until it's like does this do the correct function and such
is it is it actually a book of names to digits or is it like a few pages
um booklet
some pages
i was just thinking if we were to store this information some type of mapping
this person probably need to use this feature like once you know when you first buy the remote control
or whenever they buy a new television so once every s
yeah
doesn't have to be used very often that's right yeah
yeah and it's
yeah
but it's a but it's a nuisance
and it's a nuisance very close to the to um to actually purchasing it so it's something that you're likely to be thinking about
mm
if you if there's w i if there's one in the shop that's that says it can avoid much of that nuisance you might be favourably inclined towards it
mm
um mm
okay this just to give us a rough idea of what we're meant to be doing for the next stage
mm
i'm pretty sure that you got that anyway
this is the conceptual one
um
i think we've come up i think we've covered everything we need to here
um i think we've decided on what you know decided on standard items for most of um rubber and such
so we're now looking at the detailed design and what we need to be doing for the next meeting
um
so for example um i'll just start at the top
you've got yourself and the industrial designer gonna be working quite closely at this stage 'cause it'll be hard not to obviously
um
looking from prototyping of some des description using clay
um i suppose you'll be told a lot more about that as uh progress
um
the user interface design
they're kind of it looks they're the idea i've pushed forward so far is maybe more of a physical one there
whereas possibly be more interested in maybe how the l. c. d. 's going to incorporate do you think
or do you s perceive that most the design design decisions still need to be based on the physical layout
mm
um well i i think other than ge getting a sort of more aesthetically pleasing form for it
um mo most of the sort of layout design decisions are are made i would say
um but then again the um the menu structure to to a considerable extent that's gonna vary according to the model of television
and also any customisations that the user might wish to incorporate
so um and one of the nice things about having an l. c. d. and a menu structure is that there is that flexibility to it
mm-hmm that's very true
um
okay
um got product evaluation as well
yeah you see i don't some of these things kinda logically follow the others
um
how can t product evaluation doesn't that come after actually seen
a product prototype
i i think we'd be yeah no
it'd be more a case of how do we envisage us performing the product evaluation once we have a model to test with
oh that's the okay sure sure sure
um so it'd be a case of do you think that just bringing users in to have them test it out
uh maybe putting a certain number of products into the field in certain places which i suppose is quite similar
mm-hmm
or just kind of hitting the streets and you know saying this is a new remote control what do you think of the look of it
okay sure
um
at this stage we still have no no target audience or
i think the target audience is pretty much anybody under the age of say maybe sixty or something ludicrous
'kay
um the reason i'm saying that is we're just looking at a a replacement remote control
something that's stylish so maybe you're even just maybe you're narrowing down your target audience simply by saying
and it's stylish
if they're buying it that often or they're maybe looking to replace something then
they've got a bit of free cash so that puts them potentially in the younger age bracket
mm-hmm
maybe even single just for the reasons of um uh excess cash flow
mm
although of course i mean at twenty five euros i don't think we're looking at charging the earth for the uh device
yep
yeah
think that's well within the normal bracket
okay
um your idea of the u. s. b. would i think would largely depend on the cost
u. s. b. 's definitely one of the cheapest interfaces out there
but it might push the cost of the overall unit up 'cause it would require not just the connection but the chip for communicating with the rest of the system
that one might have to be based on
programmable memory as well
the u. s. b. for which
for the remote control
the the idea was that maybe it could connect up for um allowing a software interface on the p. c. for a larger programming due to the fact that we've gone for such a nice
oh right okay
easy minimal design normally
we've w definitely talking some type of
um
but didn't they just say it's just for t. v. or are we gonna
it's just for t. v. but for
different
programming it to use your t. v. you might hook it up to the p. c.
okay yeah
i i'm not sure but i'm thinking maybe that the additional cost of the u. s. b. might be prohibitive
mm
we don't know unless it would make sense to
but you're gonna need some type of flash memory or something
yeah i mean it's
well something that doesn't you wouldn't have to redo the whole thing once the batteries are changed you know once you turn off the power
yeah
yeah
the other thing i mean it i mean it would need to ha it would need to have um some sort of on board memory anyway
yeah
um f for one for one thing because i do think that the menu system should be um uh i mean although you know
it's not going to be terribly complicated if it's just controlling one device the menu system ought to be um
o ought to be customisable and uh
different languages uh different skins and stuff like that
mm-hmm
mm-hmm
w
how uh how uh how you want say the um the the menu structure for flicking through channels if you've got lots of channels
sure
i if it was customisable as in different languages and stuff that does open it is supposed to be international right
that sort of thing
so
it would make sense to
it would make sense if you could
i would say to
um and we'd better be careful about the time as well
okay
we've already had the five minute warning so
um
i would say yeah
international would make sense
um you're gonna look at product evaluation
i'm i'd better start writing up a hell of a lot of crap
um you're gonna look a bit more at the kind of the physical make up you say
um looks like we're gonna need a maybe a kind of prototype in clay
yeah
uh we'll see how that goes
are we going to be supplied with the clay is what i want to know
um
so um do i think we've got an idea of where we need to go for the next meeting would you say
where is the clay
yeah
they're going with the fashion thing like the design spongy rubber
mm-hmm
the fruit and veg
this one
yeah i would s that would be my my feeling
yeah
mm
i th i think i would largely want to actually steer clear of the whole sort of fruit and veg thing
bu but um but the spongy idea i like
i like it a lot
we seem to have quite a general consensus that the idea of the the r rubber could be quite
yeah
yeah
i having it i having it sort of br bright yellow i think that's quite a good idea though maybe we could have options for colours as well
yeah
and again this has the advantage of being harder to lose
sure
i mean we are trying to promote a remote control but we wanna keep the company brand as well so
yeah
mm-hmm
so we always need to remember that somewhere we're meant to be getting the slogan on
possibly i'm think i'm not sure but i'm seeing a little bit of space around maybe the joystick area which could be used
mm
yeah
um
i was like like i said before i i think we should have the r. r. on the uh on the top function button
okay
and i think that says it all really
i think so too
right
see everybody in a half hour
sa
that should hopefully do the trick um
'kay
sorry about the small delay
falling a little bit behind schedule
and that's uh fifteen twenty five
okay
so just to try and roughly go over what we agreed in the last one um
we're gonna go for something uh uh how was it
uh the new black i believe
um something that looks good 'cause that seems to be in preference to actual functionality in the end though we should never avoid functionality of course
uh many of our components are gonna be standard off the shelf
but it seemed like we were gonna require at least an advanced chip and we were still very much for the idea of using an l. c. d. display
um other things were we were hoping to use rubber most likely gonna be double curved etcetera
okay
so um due to your hard work we might as well let the uh two designers go first and uh show us the prototype
okay it's a
quite how the best way to do this is i'm not sure but
i think if we both step up and uh
outline our ideas
okay
now
do uh doing the prototype gave us a bit more insight into the ergonomics of the design
um for one thing
it turned out that the only point at which it needs to be articulated for handedness is um is h i is down here for the uh l. e. d.
as it turned out the whole thing transfers from the right to left hand fairly well from the point of view of operating the uh function buttons and joystick
though it might be an idea to be able to a adjust the positions for the base of the joystick just a little bit for uh
okay
ju just a thought
you could simply have a slightly ovoid shaped joystick that could then just be turn uh twisted round
so that the uh sticky uh so that the bit that sticks out a bit more is on one side or the other
but as you as you see with the uh with holding it in the left hand
the l. uh the l. c. d. is nowhere useful so that would need to be articulated
uh if we're going to retain ergonomic design
um now i i got your note about uh keeping the cost down
i'm afraid yeah
yeah
we'll go into that a bit more but please go on
this design could be done with um
with uh plastic casing
though i would recommend around the grip part here in the middle
having maybe just a rubber grip over that which would allow for a slightly more sort of bio morphic form and a bit more ergonomic as well
as for the um
as for the single curve
um well this edge and this edge like i say it would be nice to have some curvature to it but it's not absolutely necessary
really the curve that's most needed is the underside so that the jo so that the joystick rests over the the edge of the hand like this
um and you have
the uh transmitter here and a wee speaker for the uh for the uh for the uh fi uh for the remote control finder
so
any further comments
um obviously it's gonna be bulkier than how it looks because it's gonna be flat on one side
so the l. c. d. will be s sticking down like this won't it
mm-hmm
yeah
'cause it you can't get it curved
uh because of costs
yeah i mean the uh yeah
and it's plastic as well so it won't be as comfortable on the hand
mm
yeah
i mean with the with the rubber design it could i you know it could pretty much mould very much to the to the user's hand
one nice wee feature if we could if we could still do the rubber
i though of was to have the uh rubber extend beyond the end of the uh of the rigid substructure
so it has a wee sort of tail that you just drape over your wrist so it stays in position nicely
mm
lovely
um
yeah
okay yeah
great
right
um
yeah i've got a if you load up my evaluation document
yeah okay
okay
excellent work
mm
um
uh evaluation
basic point uh have a list of criteria that we need to rate the prototype by
um then we will it's a seven s um seven
seven step kinda evaluation process
so um not seven steps seven scale
so after we've finished doing all the ratings for each criteria we average that and that will give us some type of uh confidence in our prototype
and uh the criteria based on real reactions' kinda goals and policies marketing strategies and also those i put together from the user requirements phase
'kay
um if you flip the
so those are the criteria
and uh perhaps i could have put 'em a bit better but you notice a few things that we've totally abandoned
which means that uh the product will score very badly on some of those points
put it mildly
so we have um true
one t
seven eight oh
fourth
okay so we have to go through each point
if we imagine it's actually straight and just give it a a score
so um how well would you say the prototype is uh how well have we realised the dream of being able to stop remotes from from being lost
or to be able to find them once they are lost
i mean uh is the homing thing still the locator is that still
yeah that's still part of the design
sure
and adam we can keep that in
yeah i believe so
so i mean i don't think anybody could actually stop a remote being lost 'cause that would mean doing something about the human element
okay
sure
but i'd like to think that we've done something about finding the damn thing once we have
t
mm
sure
mm
and making it a bright colour helps with the personally i would have gone for purple
mm
bright colour
so we still have that noise thing yeah
mm-hmm
os on a scale of one to seven how would you guys rate it for finding finding it once it's lost
i'd say number one
number one
one
yeah
okay
number number one for the first criteria
i think w if it was just the sounder then th i mean something i've found with uh w w with say tr trying to find uh a cordless phone or a m mobile
you can hear it but you can't quite pin it dow pin down where it is
yeah you can tell what room the mobile is
what about what if the the volume on the t. v. 's turned up massively and uh you just wanna turn down the volume can't find remote
bu
suppose you have to go to the t. v. and do it manually
yeah
yeah
mm
mm
yeah
like y you wouldn't hear the speaker
um
mm-hmm
just before we go through all of the steps here um well what we'll do is
you wanna say something
um if we can look at the criteria you're gonna evaluate and then we'll come back to the product evaluation if that's alright
that's fine
yeah is that
oh that's that's fine
um so is there anything here that you
that you wanted to cover as in the criteria that you've covered
and then we'll come back pretty much promptly to this
what do you mean cr is there anything i wanna
i is there any of these criteria that need any explaining
or is there anything that yous thought tha really would stand out compared to the others
um a few
something i neglected from my initial research is that real reactions has a a goal strategy that all of the products be inspired by material fashion and clothing fashion
that is why fruit and veg being popular in the home and in clothing was important and they want all their products to be somehow inspired by current trends in fashion
so they say we put the fashion in electronics well they really mean it they they're very big on fashion so
okay
that's this bit right here
and uh this bit is this one easy to use for visitors or for anybody
i guess it's just the same as saying easy to use interface so it's kinda condensed into one
and we can come back to it you said
so
okay
no and which we will do very very shortly
um
okay
slight problem we had was that we have an amazing four euros over budget for what we were hoping to do
um most of it stems from the use of the l. c. d. which i think in the end accounted for about half of our expenditure because of course we required a chip as well
um the only way to get this down was either to ditch the a l. c. d.
at which point we've removed a large part of how we were gonna interface require more buttons etcetera
or what we did was that we um we as in i as i was quickly going over it was altering the actual structure
um changing it to plastic and a solid unit with a single curve design would allow us to come back into the um proposed costs and we're just scraping it in
we've got point two of a euro left over there
so we're just managing it really
even then as well um there was no criteria technically defined for a joystick so i've used what i think's appropriate
with any luck that won't mean that we've incurred more cost than we can actually afford to
it blows a lot of our really good ideas kind of slightly to one side for example the possibility of having a u. s. b. connection is definitely not viable now
um
different languages
that should still be viable
we've got an advanced chip we've got the use of the l. c. d.
so being able to communicate in multiple languages is still very much a possibility
yeah
um but what's something we need to decide on is how we're gonna go from here
we do need to try and come up with an idea which could be continued with other people if need be
um
we can i can bring the excel up sheet up and uh show you if you wish um
i really think as m much as it pains me is that we might have to go with plastic and some kind of solid design
possibly meaning that the l. c. d. wouldn't be in this perfect place
it might be s stuck like slightly between what would be good for left handed and what would be good for a right handed person
mm-hmm i suppose o one thing that could be done is h is have it um circular and have it s so that the uh the pink actually goes a bit over the pinkie finger
okay
mm
mm
so that uh th
it very much is about making concessions unfortunately
um
mm
do you have any data on how much um different prints cost
i mean can you get the entire thing printed with a design um
um b b b da is you mean on the plastic or
let's have a look
you now have as much information as i do
yeah yeah
um
so as you can see here for example the battery
really not very little choice in that one
we've gone for one of the cheaper options as well
unfortunately we require the advanced chip if we're gonna do what we're needing to
i've said single curved
we really do need it to be that way for the ergonomics of it
um plastic for some reason incurs no cost which i've had to very much make advantage of
despite the fact that rubber's only got a value of two euros per unit
problem comes here as you can see in the interface
um
if i've read this thing correctly then we can save point five of a euro here in that it's not per push button
that might make sense because then a numeric keypad would come in at um what
four point five euros which is an awful lot so that could well be wrong
even if we save point five there it would just mean that we're most likely placing it in actually just gaining a colour for the unit
which has had to be put to one side
as you can see
the use of an l. c. display um advanced chip and what would determine the scroll wheel here as well because it's an integrated scroll scroll wheel push button that wasn't quite what i think they had in mind with a joystick
why would why would that be more expensive than an individual push button and scroll wheel together
that's quite significantly expensive
i that's something you'll have to take up with the bean counters
um
mm
yeah
as you can see i mean that's taken up well over half of the price
yeah
so um i'm very much open to suggestions of where we go
but because we need to shed what was four euros off of the um the price of for what we really desired
this one comes in under price as you can see but this was the one that sacrificed the material for the case and for the actual case design
we don't even have uh speakers here
the like uh we uh what about speakers and transmitters and stuff like that
have we factored that in
mm
uh no we haven't not
transmitter receiver speakers
plus the extra device itself that's gonna be on a t. v.
is that gonna be a button or
that'll it literally would just be a button
yeah
that's too expensive isn't it
we might have to
it looks like almost nothing
mm
oh good call i missed that
i i mean it's not on here but um
that's a very valid point
did they s do we have to use an advanced chip for the l. c. d.
yeah
okay
well that's yeah
so if we're gonna go with the l. c. display then that's
what's a hand dyna dynamo
you have to wind it up
i believe so yeah
that would probably not be in keeping with the um the fashion statement and such yeah
technology
fashion
yeah
okay
so basically the only new thing is the l. c. d. on the remote now
being manipulated by the joystick yeah
oh and joystick yeah
which i'm defining as scroll wheel
um
and we couldn't replace the joystick right
because we would need four extra buttons to replace it up down left and right
and that would be more expensive than a but is a scroll wheel not just back and forward
mm
yeah it's just because there was no actual definition for what a joystick might be that
that's what i've labelled it for the purposes of this evaluation
so
the l. c. d. basically is the big selling point of
if we remove the l. c. display we could save ourselves
the remote
a fair amount
which you could
but that's what makes it uh original though isn't it
mm
yeah
i think if we remove the the l. c. display then there was absolutely no point to any of these meetings and we just we could just put our branding on any other remote control
yeah
yeah
um
uh k
it's a shame
we should possibly have
if we could've increased the price we could've manufactured that and we could've got something far closer to what we were hoping to
does this does this bear in mind that i mean it's a bit ridiculous that they're gonna charge us
what is it like this much money for three million if we're gonna buy three million components you know
again you'll have to argue with the accountants on that one
mm
um but for the purposes of this meeting i'm we're gonna have to stick with these figures
'kay
so
i would say that it would seem like the general opinion is we're gonna keep the l. c. display 'cause it's about what really separates us
i think so
despite the cost it's gonna incur
um
are people maybe not happy with but are willing to go ahead with this in going for a plastic solid case to keep the l. c. d.
mm-hmm
um yeah i mean one thing i mean ho uh how much extra would it be to to keep i mean keep the um the articulation
it's hard to tell
um i would say that you're at least gonna take double curved and even then i'm not quite sure if that's incorporating the idea of articulation
this is what i'm wondering
yeah
oh no i think i i it d that it needn't require it to be double curved
it can be s yeah it can still be single curved but
it's uh it's just it's just it's just that the case would come in t would be made in two parts and then joined together with an articulation
you just
single curved with articulation
could we could we not get rid of the curvy the curvous the curvaceousness and focus on the menu being the best interface
'cause like we do we have re restrictions on software
that's what we need for the joystick i think though
oh but there has to be
mm
yeah i mean and i mean the uh i mean if you look uh if you look closer at the uh at the prototype here
the lines here along the grip
are actually quite straight
um i mean yeah on the on the l. c. d. i mean although we've done it with a curve it could just as easily be done um without curves
but the curves all o over hand is it
the curve that's really needed is up here
joystick
to put uh to keep the joystick in a good ergonomic position for it to have it rest on the top of the hand
okay
sure
okay my bad
we wouldn't actually save a lot by reducing it anyway so i mean for the purposes of this meeting maybe we can state that single curve still allows articulation
mm
um unless we hear otherwise we could go ahead with that proposal
so i think the product is not gonna perform so well for my criteria
which is what we can get onto now
as long as so are we gonna say w we have to keep an eye on the time as well but we're gonna say um single curved design
oh wait a minute
sample speaker
what is a sample speaker
is that somewhat similar to what we want
it could well be but at a cost of
mm no that's that voice response thing that we got the email about
costs four
yeah
but i thought it was just completely pointless
you got a email about voice response
yeah
i did not so
alright
b i basically it was saying that our labs had come up with a chip that you could
you know say hello to and it would say hello back in a friendly female voice
okay yeah we'll definitely won't go with that one
we won't go with that one did you say
i mean i we
yeah that's voice recognition so
okay okay
um
so okay yeah battery definitely
so it looks like we're gonna get rid of the whole loca locator thing
it looks like it unless we can manage to put it in under point two euros um
yeah
okay
okay
maybe even slight well oh yeah pretty much point two euros i'd say
mm-hmm
so we'll leave that one for now
we'll just have
are we going for a special colour at all
it's uh a case of um
i'm uh slightly unsure
one point five of a euro for one push button doesn't sound quite right
so maybe it's a case of a push button is maybe one or more
um
mm
well i was for a case
at which point if
or had you already incorporated that
oh special colour for the case
well you got point five there
it's literally a case of whether or not this is correct
i'm not quite sure if they're i don't think they mean point five euros per button
mm-hmm
okay well l let's say that and then we can have our special coloured case and then we at least have make it a little harder to lose
so
there we go
because most m most remotes are a fairly dingy colour that gets camouflaged under any pile of crap in a living room
w what's the default colour
white or black
black's probably the normal colour you'd say yeah
or grey
right
i quite like that colour that you're fetching there it's uh definitely for make it glow in the dark even better
yellow
yeah
so
will we go with that then
okay
yeah
it's not and we can see we'll come back to uh your evaluation which you're probably now going to pan us but there we go
sure
okay
okay
so uh
just to give you an idea um you want to go maybe a bit quickly as well i'm not sure how much time
we've not hit the five minute mark warning yet but
right okay
okay
think it's ten minutes left
ten
'kay
ability to stop remotes from being lost or to find them once they are lost
um
okay
special colour
special colour
mm mm four
uh uh four
three
mm
three if we're being generous i feel
three
i think we can do three
three
th the special colour doesn't would i think make a difference
think we're being generous here with three
it makes it stand out from you know it's lost in a big pile of crap it stands out from the rest of the crap
mm
yeah
okay
okay
reduce the number of unused buttons
we're down to t two buttons is it
two buttons
two buttons and a joystick
okay so that's a one
you know where that's
totally
yeah
i'd say we're doing well there
okay that was good
easy to use interface buttons menu menus that's yeah that's good
'kay that's we're not doing so badly
um easy to use oh okay let's forget that one
mm-hmm
fancy looking
as he models the
it doesn't get much fancier
sure
and we could do whatever we like with the l. l. c. d.
yeah let's just assume it's a good l. c. d. display
maybe i was panicking for no reason
are we going one on
i'd say we go two 'cause like f the fanciest would be the double curved
yeah w maybe you'd be a bit too yeah
wouldn't it
i'd
mm
yeah
with the articulators
there we go
yeah that's m
with bells on it
that's that's better too
more accurate numbers
technologically innovative
well we're getting rid of the locator thing which which yeah
which is a shame
mm
i'd give it a three for this for that
no need for teletext
yeah
i mean the menus thing is something you don't normally see on um on a remote but you see it in a lot of other places
'kay
yeah mobile phones
mm
and y what you're doing is moving the menu from the television to the remote control so it's
mm-hmm
you say three
i might go as far as two on that
three
i'd give it a three
i'd be tempted with three yeah
three
okay
okay
we'll get panned on the next one anyway
materials that people find pleasing
sponginess is what they really would have wanted apparently
yeah w
it is yeah
don't blame them
um because of the way that we've minimalised the number of buttons and such
yeah
plastic it sucks
but it's no worse than any of the other pl remote controls we have
that's true
it's not a step backwards
five
mm-hmm
six
i'd s i i'd give it a six to be honest
six
yeah okay let's give it a six
okay that's totally thrown everything off balance
inspired by the latest interior and clothing fashion
w we could
what colour were we gonna make it
put a leopard print on it
well i i i would sa i would say give a s give a selection of colours
um we went with yellow we went with yellow for the prototype 'cause we had yellow
i know but
if i were buying one i'd go for purple
leopard print would be cool
but um by this i think it's more a case of fruit and veg
yeah we gotta
i'd say the colour of the border there world you'd find that that's that'd stand out
yeah
like yellow yeah
it would also help keep the the product placement s yeah
logo brand
mm
mm 'kay
but
is it inspired by clothing fashion
th th they're referring to the fruit and veg thing
is this like a banana type colour
could we stretch no still it's not shaped like a banana is
yes
it's kind o it probably
that's kinda
i it won't be when it's been
oh is that 'cause it's flat
budgeted
what is what fruit or veg is flat
i i think s i i think this isn't not particularly fruit and veggie
yeah
um
or we might have to suffer badly for this one as well
yellow courgette
well i mean it's probably more fruit and veg than most other things out there bar fruit and veg so what four
four
oh that's it's very ambitious yeah um
is that being too generous
mm
i'd i'd i don't think fruit and veg is the sole criterion
oh dear
sure
is the sole criterion for being um fashion fashionable or inspired by current fashions
inspired by
um i'd g i'd rate i'd rate this fairly highly from that point of view actually
well this this what we're gonna t this is their motto like
yeah
and we're we're not doing well on it
this is their strategy
i m imagine we actually had some money invested in this and the amount that we invest is gonna be proportional to the marks
might we might wanna be a bit more skepible sceptical about
this one
what would you think yourself
i would say i mean it's it's not at all right
in any way or shape or form
we didn't m
well it's kind of curved and we can make it yellow and that's pretty much banana like
okay the the yellow banana like thing is i think is okay
si it's got a curve to it
right five
is that sound reasonable
am i do you think i'm stretching the uh the use of the banana
yeah i'll go with five
five
yeah
'kay so we have one two three four five six seven
so five seven ten sixteen twenty one
which gives us an average of three
it's well this would be in the middle
so we it's it's not bad
it's in the good section
it's not bad and considering the don't pick the pen
oops
sorry
um
i'm i'm sorry
y oh and you've knocked batteries out
um right okay it's considering the price we had to get this in
's bad design that thing
mm-hmm
to have a positive you know even based on the four of us being heavily biased um
yeah
it was gonna be quite hard to get anything standing out i'd say possibly based on
um the the cost features
mm yeah
mm
even if we were to increase this entire thing by by seven we were to go down a grade to to four
we would have to do i mean we didn't we weren't that kinda optimistic too optim overly optimistic
you know like we didn't we didn't add we didn't subtract a whole seven points from these things so i think we're definitely on the good bit
even if we gave this one seven and this one seven that's still only three extra points over seven
you know it's yeah we did it w it was okay
mm
it was good
personally
i think given that
the product um
only replaces a single remote control that you've already got
are people really gonna shell out twenty five euros for something that's only marginally good
well it depends who your who's what the target people are like you'd say
maybe the fashion conscious
maybe it's been targeted
women would be going oh look at that 's cool it looks like a it's
mm-hmm
yellow looks like a banana it's cool it's gotta look good in the sitting room
hide it in the fruit basket
rather than the l. c. d. whereas uh more technical like like more uh people in with the latest technology it's good
it's got an l. c. d. screen 's only got two buttons and a joystick
so
which which kind of people would be more
likely to buy it
probably the people technologically
they're usually the ones that buy pointless stuff
i think so
i mean my mum still has not learnt how to use text messaging on her phone and she's had it for a long time you know
she uses it to make phone calls and that's it
yeah
so i think if sh if my mum saw a remote control like this with only two buttons and a joystick
i mean that'll probably be the first one she decides not to buy you know
mm-hmm
she'd be like is this a remote control i don't how do you use it and stuff like that
so even if it is really user friendly to us but we're used to using menus all the time
mm-hmm
i s i suppose one thing is that b because it's technically innovative
um for someone who's sort of technophobic the fact that it simply looks unfamiliar would be daunting
yeah
yeah
i think it's totally uh radical to have a remote control with no no numbered buttons yeah
um
yeah
yeah
but like radical good maybe
okay
um don't know how lo much longer we've got
at least five minutes i think
um quickly we'll pop onto project evaluation
um
so
we've got these uh four criteria here for uh satisfaction
does anybody want to um
um do you have any opinions on any of them
for example um we'll work backwards i suppose
the ability to work on this project using the technology we've been presented with
um people made good use of the
uh pen and paper
i would say
wrote nearly a page but not
yeah got notes and doodles
yeah
i'm not quite sure what the advantage for us using a digital pen might be
i think tracking
well i think this is a i think the digital pen's mostly for the benefit of the uh
mm
of the researchers studying this
it's all p goes into their corpus
though it would have been nice to be able to transfer the um
it must
transfer our n our paper notes onto the uh
computer ourselves
yeah that woulda been pretty good
it does seem like the paper's still a heavy consideration for taking notes
so maybe this is literally just a way around it
um i dunno
how are people satisfied with the teamwork we've managed to display today
good
i'd yeah i liked it yeah
leadership
as much as can be leadered in this uh thing
very good
i li yeah top marks
um last one we've got is room for creativity
well yeah
now i think we got
unti uh uh until uh until accounts came along squish
we're burs bursting with creativity
we we're not lacking in ideas you know it's that was not the problem
yeah i think of in the end ideas that can be used sadly
not so much that we weren't full of ideas but of ones that are gonna allow us to actually build the thing
mm-hmm
it's a bit of a pity
um i would have to agree on that
i think we needed a larger budget
yeah
if you're going to aim your a um product maybe at the technological kind of sector
then you can afford to maybe jack the price up slightly from what it is
because they will pay outrageous cash to
yeah
mm
i mean i th i mean i think to r retaining the s the more sort of bio morphic form in the articulation would gain more in s uh would gain more profit in sales than it would lose in uh
first on the market
in added expense
mm
and the price was like it was twice the
w assembly cost
and would it have to be twice that
it could be like coulda had the assembly like maybe fifteen euro
it could even
we'll still settle for twenty five
that's true yeah
maybe
um i suppose these are all that will have to be taken up with a at a different group at i guess
as to a the costs involved
but i mean
we've got a a prototype
such as it is
so i dunno i i think it's gone okay today considering the information that we've
had at our disposal and um such
maybe the counts wou woulda been better if we had a list or more
yeah to begin with
in the beginning yeah
yeah
probably would have mean we could have come up with a lot more solid design in the end i would have to agree
yeah
it is very much a pity to um get so far into the stage and then find out that maybe some of your ideas are just a bit too expensive
always hard to tell until you know the costs
um
okay
are the costs within budget
well they are now that we have our slightly less than capable product
okay
we've evaluated it and we can say that we came out with a value of three
yeah
actually i want th one thing i would say i mean something that could perhaps be part of the product mm the um m product testing market research process would be to uh produce mock ups of both versions and see just how much of a difference the over going over budget
um m would make to sales
it's yeah
and like response from consumers
and we could even you know market two versions
wee cheapie version with the nice bio morphic rubber
and then the final one where you get to call it hal
sure
but we'll go into that later
yes
right um is there anything else that anybody would like to to add um
anything they think that's not been covered before i quickly write up a final report
um i dunno i mean we've got a product
we maybe aren't as happy with it as we'd like to be but
we've got something we think we can maybe stick onto the the market and sell
and of course something we have been avoiding talking about 'cause of we've no information is selling them directly to the manufacturers
yeah
there is a huge market
i mean we've briefly touched on it but we've no more knowledge then there's little we can say on that
yeah
mm
yeah
so um unless anybody's got anything they'd like to add
we can maybe round this up slightly earlier than we'd need to and then we can finish up the writing and such
and i can get my bus
yeah
okay
yeah
okay let's
uh thank you for your participation
thank you
thank you
i was actually kind of upset you know at the budget and that we had to cut a lot of stuff
it's like man we we can't have the locator thing
and s yeah that's just bad
do you think maybe the prices were were made
that a question we can ask
uh making a profit of fifty million euros
alright so twenty five
mm 'kay
so it's go gonna have to be be pretty damn trendy
so yeah i've
the only the only remote controls i've used usually come with the television and they're fairly basic
yeah
mm-hmm
yeah
so uh
yeah i was thinking that as well
i think the the only ones that i've seen that you buy are the sort of one for all type things where they're yeah
yeah the universal ones
mm
yeah
so presumably that might be an idea to
but but to sell it for twenty five you need a lot of neat features
put into
slim
for sure
yeah
yeah yeah
uh 'cause i mean what uh twenty five euros that's about
i dunno fifteen pounds or so
mm-hmm it's about that
and that's quite a lot for a remote control
yeah yeah
mm
um well my first thoughts would be most remote controls are grey or black
as you said they come with the t. v. so it's normally just your basic grey black remote control functions so maybe we could think about colour
uh-huh
mm-hmm
make that might make it a bit different from the rest at least
um and as you say we need to have some kind of gimmick
so um i thought maybe something like if you lose it and you can whistle you know those things
okay
the the keyrings yeah yeah
because we always lose our remote control
right
uh yeah uh
okay that's cool
being as a marketing exper expert i will like to say like before deciding the cost of this remote control or any other things we must see the market potential for this product like what is the competition in the market
what are the available prices of the other remote controls in the prices
what speciality other remote controls are having and how complicated it is to use these remote controls as compared to other remote controls available in the market
okay
so before deciding or before finalising this project we must discuss all these things like and apart from this it should be having a good look also
okay
because people really li uh like to play with it when they are watching movies or playing with or playing with their c. d. player
mm
m. p. three player like any electronic devices
mm-hmm
mm-hmm
they really want to have something good having a good design in their hands so yes all this
yeah
okay
'kay
uh what do we think a
so we're looking for
'kay
what do we think a good size would be for this
we're
sorry carry on
'cause i i know as you add more buttons to the remote it sometimes gets so big and clunky and there's just like a hundred buttons on it
yeah
mm-hmm
mm-hmm
yeah
or you could have a really small slim one but then you could lose it easily
then you lose it yeah
okay
kind of um maybe more like a p. d. a. kind of just hand held like 'cause
for for uh remember we're trying to make it for twelve euros fifty
yeah
no i wasn't no sorry i wasn't thinking of the screen of like a p. d. a. but
okay well right we'll have to um i'll we're k having another meeting in half an hour so um we should all look into a bit
okay
uh oh actually no we'll allocate
so you do the looking around at other remote controls
yeah
um if you could maybe come up with sort of shapes and suggested shades or whatever and you could look into um
basically how how it's made i. e. like how you make it all in one how what sort of materials are available to you whatever
and obviously other instructions will come from the personal coach
right
which will probably just usurp what i said so
so you want me to look at shapes and everything you said
shapes and colours and um basically how to make it attractive
yep
okay
uh
mm-hmm
and you look at competition and design
yep
cool
okay
okay
so we have uh
wait for emails
uh
um
hmm
okay groovy
and no doubt we'll get um
oh no
sorry it's okay
sorry
we'll get um warnings for next meetings as well
okay cool
okay
i shall i can't imagine these are worth much
okay
hmm
fashion into electronic
okay
um minutes from the last meeting which were essentially that we uh had decided on roles for each of you
however um there are some changes that i've got from on high that um
okay
are a bit uh well w what i didn't actually realise it was that the uh this is for a specific television
okay
so the all in one idea goes out the window
and they require that the uh actually i'll get to that at the end point number four
mm-hmm
um we'll get what you've got and then we can see what we can adapt from it
so um presentations were you anybody got raring to go
yeah
yeah
raring to go
okay
good stuff
mm
um
oh i need to plug you in
so how
s
wow
just about
it's a inspired design
sh do you want me to hold it
uh there we go just screw 'em on in
gonna have to swap them round so now it was function f. eight
so after that
f. eight
f oh sorry f. eight
that's the wee blue one
blue one f. eight
should do it good one
okay
yeah
yeah
uh me again rajan the marketing expert
uh as we have decided in the last meeting that i have to find out sorry yeah sure
hold on sorry
and if you just click that it'll go ahead one at a time
yeah yeah
uh actually sorry i have to see the other sorry
sorry uh
yeah thank you
uh yes i have to look at the uh market potential for this product uh like consumer likings and everything
what is the potential for this product and are we able to achieve our a net profit or our aims or not
then
p press f. five to start it first
sorry
okay
yeah i can okay
hmm
jesus
uh then uh the methodology i adopted to find out all this was market survey
a a detailed market survey on consumers was done to find out their likings and dislikings
what they prefer what they not prefer w what problems they do encounter in all this type of things
and what we got was we found that if you uh what they th what problems they are having with different uh remote controls available in the market
seventy five percent of users they do find it that the remote controls available in the market are ugly
they are not so good looking
so we have to put stress on this uh we have to take care of this fact also like our design
uh should be appropriate should be good looking for the consumers
and yes that's wi uh this will definitely this can definitely put uh uh enhance our sales
uh and even uh the good thing about this is that eighty percent of users they are willing to pay high uh pay more for this uh good looking remote controls also
so even if the available market goes for the available uh even if the market goes for the available remote control is less even then we can sell it at twenty five euros
which maybe which may seem quite high but if our looks are are if the re remote control we design have a good better uh better look uh designs
then we can hope that consumers will prefer these g remote controls
excellent
then
and the second thing some some companies they think that they should have more and more functions of the users uh or in their remote controls
but rather than those having more functions in the remote controls we should emphasise what actually consumer want what they operate rather than making it too complicated
because mostly it has been found that fifty percent of the users they use only ten percent of the buttons
so there is no point of having ninety percent buttons making the remote controls too bulky
too complicated too expensive a because i think i believe that technology is useful only if uh the consumers they want to use it
otherwise there is no point of having all this type of things
so this will not only reduce the cost of our remote controls but it will increase our profit also
so we have to take care of this fact also
then
uh it was function i want to go to
oh you wanna go back
just escape
uh escape okay thank you
then if we look at this slide uh these are in your shared documents you can see like
okay
okay
uh sorry
so sorry i was just gonna say what was the question for this
or is are you coming on to that
ah t look all the market potential what uh how we should design consu our remote controls
okay
what they should be there so as to en enhance our profit enhance our sales
so these percentages are are what
yeah these are different age group persons like uh sorry i can open it in another way
okay
uh yes
speech recognition
if we look at the costs whether the consumers they are willing to uh pay more for speech recognition in a remote control or not
we can find that they up to a thirty five years age group we have a very good disliking for this uh this uh point
like for speech recognition in a remote control
so we can emphasise on this point also like
because it will definitely enhance our sales in this ag in this particular age group from uh fifteen to thirty five
hmm
and i uh and i think that most of the users of the rem uh t. v. are belong to this age group
hmm
so we should look
we're als we we're looking at who buys it as well
yeah
we can look at that that factor also so yes
uh which i think the twenty five to thirty five is uh usual sort of
mm mm
yeah
so and
and then
fifteen to twe
yes
i think so
uh if we look at this data how how uh h how what are the problems the consumers are facing with the existing remote controls in the market
they find that thirt uh thirty five percent uh thirty four percent of the consumers they find too difficult to operate a remote control
so it should be in such a way that it should be easy to learn how to operate these remote controls and we should provide pl uh spe uh proper manuals for its use also so as that people consumers could easily learn
they need not to have any much technical knowledge to see uh to know how to operate these remote controls
mm-hmm
so this is also a very goo uh major factor to loo uh take into consideration to enhance our profits and sales
so um this is all about
okay
uh market potential by me
mm-hmm
uh yes th thank you
okay thank you
um follow on with helen
yeah please
yep sure that's cool um
yeah we have to take that out
oh so we do yeah
yeah
sorry
fun and games
sorry
don't know if the cable's gonna be long enough
uh sorry i have
i think i just kicked over whatever it runs on underneath as well
brian this one also i
yeah
okay
i can turn my computer quickly if that's okay
thank you very much brian
if you want me to help yeah
um yep
yeah
okay and then what do i press f. eight
uh f. eight
function f. eight
function f. eight
oh right
mm s
okay cool
it's not coming
oh
function f. eight okay
yeah
yeah
no signal
hmm
computer
there you go
computer adjusting yeah
okay
cool
okay and then how do i press the the big one to get it on to the big
yeah
uh f. five
f. five and i press that again to get it off as well do i
um f. five and escape'll bring it back and just uh the left button for advancing
escape
okay so um i'm the interface design designer user interface designer sorry
uh i'm concerned with um w what effect the apparatus should have on the user and um i'm i'm also i want to point out that our motto
put the fashion in electronics so obviously we as a company we want to make our products trendy and fashionable it's a big concern of ours
okay and how do i press n just the next button
uh just a left uh
the arrow
okay
left mouse button
so um i looked at existing designs and also um the information that raj gave us was very useful about what people like what people dislike
um and what people fashionable because we said people between twenty five and thirty five were the main um buyers of of our t. v. i think
mm-hmm
okay
so um what they like and what they find fashionable
'kay
and ergonomics we said um i don't know i haven't actually been able to do any of this myself
but um maybe that comes up i don't know
that can come under arlo as well
and the findings well
the basic that was the basic function to send messages to the television set
that's what people want to do
uh
um so they need to be included um but i've got some pictures here of some leading ones
i don't know how to get to them do i press f. five is it
uh if you if you escape then you can see your bar
escape
oh okay cool
i haven't got my glasses on so i hope it's this one
uh okay
these are two leading um remote controls at the moment
you know they're grey they've i mean this one's got loads of buttons
'kay
it's hard to tell from here what they actually do and they don't look very exciting at all
um personally i prefer this one just because it's looks easier use it's a bit more sleek with more of this silver stuff
mm-hmm
um but there you go that's what we're up against and i think we can do much better than that
we hope so
of course
um
hang on
f. five okay sorry
personal preferences
um well i think we need to l i think the ergonomics is quite um important um
yeah particularly if we've uh there was a bit in raj's about r. s. i. and things as well
uh-huh
yeah
and um i thought not too edgy and like a box
more kind of hand held more um not as uh computery and or organic yeah more organic shape i think
organic
um simple designs like the last one we just saw not too many buttons and as raj pointed out
only ten percent fifty percent of people only use ten percent of the buttons
mm-hmm
so i think what we can miss out on the buttons we can make up for in design and and how nice it looks
sales
okay
um
hand held and portable i think is portamint is important because t. f. t. have just um released um i think is it a a remote control for presentations or uh and a big seven inch big screen
yeah it's like a yeah
anyway so um
it's
yeah
no seven inches isn't that big but um anyway um so hand held and portable and uh m i thought about other functions for t. v. but as you pointed out people don't actually want that
right
so maybe we forget about that
and also the company want to keep it stuck to the t. v. for uh to keep down the production time
yeah
it's for one t. v. oh right okay sure
and so the last thing i thought w which i quickly mentioned in the other one was maybe a bit of a gimmick to set us apart from other people
mm-hmm
like glow in the dark um which does already e exist but it's not very widely used i don't think
exactly
yeah
yeah
easy finder with the a whistle function or something or rechargeable station because it's a pain when you run out of batteries
okay
yeah
and i think that yep that's it
that's cool
so uh i noticed your talk about speech recognition and whistling
okay
mm-hmm
and uh i was just curious to know have we done any research into how many people can whistle
um or if is that a function we want in the remote
um i haven't been able to
um do you have trouble whistling
i don't but i i know a lot of people do right
really
ooh
yeah it just i mean it has to be a certain kind of whistle too right
mm-hmm yeah or some sort of voice
yeah i suppose that's true
well i suppo uh you could y you could have the you could have the basically um instead of a whistle if it's got the voice recognition you could have it just
you know where are you
yeah
that's costly though
yeah
um a much easier thing is just any loud noise like clapping um shouting you know uh and then what would the response be
mm-hmm
hmm
yeah
sounds good
it beeps back at you or something
yeah something
okay
well uh let me set this up
so i plug it in press f. five
function f. five
function f. eight for the um the uh
or function f. eight
okay
oh you need to twiddle the thingamibobsy thing
okay
i think it's uh just to lock it in
yeah
it's got it
okay
okay
um
so as the industrial designer my job is to take an input from you guys um so it's good you went first
alright
and i jotted down some notes as to what are the b needs and uh what kind of novel features we can add to differentiate our product from the others
let's remember that
um so raj told us that uh consumers are willing to spend more for fancy products
and um he also mentioned that uh the current products don't always match users' operating behaviour
um a lot of the buttons aren't used and uh
he mentioned that they're not fun to use
and uh a novel feature which uh we just brought up was this this automatic speech recognition feature or noise detection feature for when you lose the remote
there could be a little microphone on it
and any noise over a certain threshold um it'll pick up as a a distress signal um from you and it'll beep back and say you know oh here i am or something of this sort
mm-hmm
but sure surely that would have to be um sort of specific rather than above a threshold 'cause if you had a loud movie on you're likely to get it beeping back at you
mm-hmm
oh yeah yeah that's true
mm-hmm
well maybe you could have a
um hmm tha that would be a consideration to take into account yes
um
sorry i didn't mean to derail you there
yeah well tha that's uh for later down the road um and then as for the user interface it should be trendy
um and not computery right so more low tech and not too many buttons
mm-hmm
so i took these all into consideration and also i have some limitations from the boss
right um and practical limitations which i kinda threw out the window
and so i did a little research and unfortunately all i had to work on was our uh our corporate archives of the great products we've made before
which include you know um space craft coffee makers and bullet trains
ah is that what that is
or uh or a high speed train
right and having personally worked with all these products uh i have a great deal of experience with uh with industrial design of these
well that's cool
if you if you can build space craft you'll have no problem with a remote control yeah
right
yeah sure
so
i figured just put 'em all together
you got a a caffeine powered space shuttle train transport to your t. v. and um
hmm
as for the user interface problem you know too many buttons
give it one button
and and it's a you know for the the cowboy in all of us i i'm not quite sure what the the function is there but
right okay
well i like that design
yeah it's a g i mean you could have a you know a
is that just switches on the speech recognition and it's entirely speech operated is it
right
yeah
so i think i i missed the budget thing it was fifty million euros
yeah
and we gotta sell twenty five of them
yeah not a problem
right
fifty million was uh prof
okay
ah now it's fif fifty million euros we've gotta uh we've g gotta make profit so we're making that at twelve and a half euros a time
as a profit
oh okay so i i mixed those numbers
okay
well i guess more realistically then we need a product that's got some kinda nifty outer casing cheap plastic uh
you know um that should be just like uh a tenth of the price maybe or less
mm-hmm
an energy source which'd probably just be uh your regular batteries um we don't wanna have it
okay
would it be possible to have the rechargeable idea
is that is that gonna mark up a lot
uh
or a little base station or something
yeah
yeah yeah we could do that too
um i hadn't thought of that
yeah
that might cost more though 'cause obviously with batteries we don't need to provide well we provide the first batteries
but it's more it's that's cheaper to just provide batteries
yeah yeah
right
i mean if you think about these base stations now it's essentially just a a lead with a sort of self connecting brake in it
a battery in it kinda
so i don't think it'd up up the price that much
right so so the unirs the user interface uh the canonical user interface for these would be just a bunch of buttons
okay
okay
but since we're a cutting edge company we uh of course will have alternatives like uh speech recognition whistling recognition and rocket power
okay
behind our product
um and lastly the transmission interface is uh just some engineering thing you don't have to worry about
okay
um so here's you know a great schematic that my uh apprentice designer gave me
um as you can see the the remote control have parts and those parts look like that and um you know it's got a little operating procedure that looks something like that
and i suppose you all know how it works because we've all used it and we wouldn't be in a company designing remote controls if we didn't know what they were so uh personal preferences
i think uh programmable options which um just require a small amount of memory uh non volatile memory
just um so the user can put in their favourite channels and maybe their preferred volume settings so that when they turn it on it's not blasting
mm
mm that's a good idea actually i like the programmable options
yeah me too
oh okay
and the uh the bells and whistles that we mentioned you know they take more budgeting
um more technical uh expenditure of effort and it's also much more likely to not work if if we add these bells and whistles
right
mm 'kay
yeah
that's all i got
'kay thank you very much um i'll take that back
ooh that's tight
right also so um a notice i got not very long before the meeting so didn't manage to forward it on to you
it is let's see i'll find it myself um
ta nah
okay i don't think we need to screw it in
just push it
yeah
we had that um to dis include teletext um because it's become outdated and everybody uses the internet anyway
mm-hmm
um dunno what oracle would have to say with that but never mind
um it's only for the television which i'm presuming means it's for a specific television
okay
and um instead of colours and sorta colour options they want corporate colour and slogan somehow implemented in the new design
corporate colour
yellow
okay
yellow
i presume
um everything all their sort of uh you know the uh corporate website and everything's yellow
mm-hmm
and the logo uh the sort of slogan we put the fa fashion in electronics uh
i don't know exactly how sort of incorpor i mean
i guess if you're going for a sort of globular shape you could kind of have it working its way round it or something
yeah
uh where am i
okay
okay so we have to decide on which functions we're going to actually have
'kay
uh now we had as listed options we had
speech recognition potentially flat screen interface l. c. d. interface um
we also want to limit the number of buttons so we'll pretty much take that one as read
mm-hmm
we'll use the the basic functions for a television
mm-hmm
no teletext
um okay hold on
although the the danger with that is it could look a bit cheap
not enough buttons you mean
yeah
well
so sorta strike a balance between a a few and a or it looks like we're just cutting on the um
mm
on the number of buttons kind of functions and stuff
i do however have this from over my head that they don't want teletext on it
mm-hmm okay
okay cool
uh maybe raj you could find out what people would think about that or maybe they'll send
about cost
some information about that about um what people whether people would require um teletext in a remote teletext option in a remote control
okay
okay um
so uh i take it your position arlo is that the bells and whistles we've gotta come up with the a gimmick but not too complicated a gimmick
yeah yeah
um so i mean a a the sort of inkling i'm getting from little bits of um web chatter that i'm getting sent is that they're quite interested in a t. f. t. display
interactive display
however that does sound a bit like the
more complicated design that rav uh sorry raj um
said people didn't like
mm-hmm mm-hmm
although i guess if there's a sort of if you think about standard interfaces that people use already
sort of windows style drop down menus or whatever i think maybe that's a bit
mm-hmm
yeah
going a bit far but you know like in a basic sense that you could have your basic selection of buttons
and if you hit a sort of menu at the top you have
um it goes to a different selection of buttons so it sorta keeps it simple
yeah
okay
um glow in the dark is that sort of with a light inside it or is it sort of glow in the dark material
um
uh
glow in the dark material i was thinking
okay
so
um so i i guess that would be cheaper than a light i think
i
uh may i say something about
yeah
yeah
uh actually i think it's really really very important point uh as if we look at the market because people mor fifty percent people they find that the remote controls are often lost somewhere in the remote
in the room
but yeah are lost and means they forget where they have kept the remote control last time
often lost s was that yeah
lost yeah
mm-hmm
but if we add speech recognition as well as glow in the dark then both these factors will help their locating the remote control
mm-hmm
like if they come and speak something at the remote control uh replies to something something and it glows in the dark
both these factors uh both these points will help them to locate the where they have kept this remote control
that's cool
mm-hmm mm-hmm
that's cool
and this will definitely enhance our uh market sales so we should take it into consideration also
okay cool
um
well hmm
speech recognition i take it
oh it's
i don't i've i know of no products um that use speech recognition well
they're act there there was a remote control that came out two years ago that had a some basic speech recognition on it
you could programme it with your channels and then you say you know like uh b. b. c. one and it goes to that channel
really
yeah it didn't work very well though because of this noise interference problem
mm
mm-hmm
they mentioned you know if the television says you are listening to b. b. c. one
yeah or a yeah an advert an advert for b. b. c. two on b. b. c. one'll switch the channel for you kinda thing
right right and so there was a lot of this
you'd be watching the t. v. and then all of a sudden it'd it'd pick up a noise and turn it off or you know or turn the volume off or something
mm-hmm
mm
'kay
but if you can work around that that noise problem
uh-huh
well what about this might get a bit too expensive actually
but what about um something that's built into the t. v. um that you can press and it'll send out a little signal you know like the ones that we can't hear or something um that that will activate the remote control starts to beep
ah that's a good idea
right
so like a kind of backwards remote from the telly
if you find if y
right and then it would do just you know uh subtractive kind of cancellation of the noise
yeah
what you could do then would be you have uh a remote controlled by the t. v. speaker
or not a remo i'm sorry a microphone by the t. v. speaker and a transmitter there that sends back to your remote
'cause you can't um expect uh the the television manufacturers to to put that feature into their t. v. s
mm
yeah that's the only thing yeah
but yeah then you have like the little se separate module by the t. v. speaker
right
that we should just stick on yeah
that comes with our remote control
which
right and then the remote control would know um what's being produced by the television
yeah
yeah
and that's a sort of basic r. f. kind of frequency so it'll be cheap
right right
mm-hmm
right right
um
yeah that's certainly possible then an another thing was about this losing the remote and trying to find it again
if you do have this sorta speech interface to it you don't even need to find it
you just say you know um whatever you whatever you want the remote for
you know to change the channel or to uh turn the t. v. on and off
you just shout your command to it and it would do it for you if it's within you know within hearing range
uh-huh
and uh you know it could be somewhere in the room y that you've no idea where it is and it would still do its job
that could also be built into the t. v. though which might make our remote control a bit obsolete
yeah
well hopefully we're uh we're ahead of the curve
it might do us out of a job
yeah okay
um
okay
i like the whole sort of remote feedback thing
um so i think rather than and that also kind of takes out the speech recognition in terms of the interference of it not working very well and things like that
mm
hmm
and the expense
so i th yeah and expense and the time
mm-hmm
so i think if we're going to go well i mean like the thing about the there's the problem with the t. f. t. or the l. c. d. kind of thing is if you're also wanting the the kind of
uh organic globby sort of feeling to it then
you might have trouble incorporating the screen
mm
um but i guess not i thin we'll just we'll just pretend that's not a problem
um uh and how are you about the glow in the dark material
is that
um
maybe not even all of it 'cause we said um colours and fashion w were important so maybe um just like a little l line that's kind of around the outside and then you can make the rest a different colour
mm
contrast contra well
yeah no th the material's cheap but it's just uh the the glow in the dark material needs some light to charge it you know
mm-hmm
and then uh if you're if you're sitting in the dark for too long it uh it won't glow any more
yeah okay
so if it's dow it's d uh yeah
or if it's down under the couch cushions um which is where i usually find mine
right
mm-hmm
right
um
okay well we can use we can still use the glow in the dark as a gimmick essentially
yeah 'cause what i thought main
um if we're gonna have to if we're gonna have the logo on as well bright yellow logo in our our um
slogan
slogan yeah
uh then you know they're gonna be fairly brightly coloured anyway
and we can have sort of a a a trimming as well of the glow in the dark material just as gimmickyness
right
mm-hmm
'cause yeah that w more than finding it
that was more like you know if you're watching a film in the dark you can um still see the remote control
mm-hmm
mm-hmm
alright so n sorta if if if we're gon if we're gonna go with the idea of um uh of feedback
that was more of a a gimmick
sort of remote finder then that kinda stuffs that one out then
do you think
mm
uh it makes it fairly unnecessary then
yeah unnecessary
okay
yeah
um okay so scratch that
uh so we've got do we want to go with the t. f. t. idea or the is that far too expensive
um yeah we're getting a lot of features now i i think
well i mean i think i think the sort of find the finder things i mean it's uh i could probably write the circuit diagram for that myself
yeah
um
well i think a consideration too is that these uh remotes get abused a lot you know they get thrown around
mm
there's a good chance the the t. f. t. screen would break or uh get damaged
mm-hmm
they're pretty fragile
so is that one of our definite requirements that they wa that it needs a t. f. t. screen
okay
um no i mean that was going on ravs uh raj's sort of um marketing research i guess
um
uh
so we'll stick with sort of programmability um for the buttons that we do have
um
so that's sort of
included in your sub module kind of stuff um
yeah mm
uh you were finding out about teletext
if you could find out that uh
yeah
totally it takes cheap speech recognition she they wi
um i think we're gonna scratch the speech recognition as a bit of a
oh
um expensive no
yeah you think so
oh no it's it's much cheaper than the t. f. t. it's just a microphone and some some integrated circuits
oh right okay
is it not the circuits that cost
and it'd it'd be a small vocabulary speech recognition system like a
oh right okay
uh well that kind of takes back the r. f. the r. f. remote sort of idea as well
okay
um
five minutes
okay
decisions
uh votes let's vote
who wants t. f. t.
no one does
excellent so we'll go with speech recognition yeah
yeah
mm-hmm that's cool
okay
um speech recognition limited buttons organic design
um
and what else was i thinking of that i haven't written down and therefore fallen out my head programmability
glow in dark
uh
if it's not too expensive s i think it's a good gimmick
uh o okay
yeah
and also integrating the remember to integrate the logo and the s slogan
mm-hmm
okay so
um can you put all these reports in the project documents folder if they're not already in there as well
so it just helps me summarize them
yeah yeah
here
sure
and um i'll put any i'm i'm putting anything i do in there anyway so uh
and where is it sorry
uh pro uh project documents
on
so it should be when you save
a. m. i. scenario controller
on your desktop so it goes save as or
oh
uh it is in shared documents
and then uh hit that little folder up thing again
where am i
projoct uh projector
project documents yeah it's on your desktop as well
again
all the way to the top yeah that's up to desktop
right and then project documents
okay cool
hmm
it is not giving anything
shared documents
and i will tr getting strings of um information i'll try and forward any specific to anybody in particular
as soon as i get them now rather than i was about to sort of tell you about the changes before the meeting
and then the meeting turned up so
okay
mm
did you get my email
i did
okay
just making sure
okay
what i thought as well about the material is um maybe not this kind of material
so
but maybe more like um this kind of rubbery material it's a bit more bouncy like you said they get chucked around a lot
um a bit more durable and that can also be ergonomic and it kind of feels a bit different from all the other remote controls
okay
yeah
the rubber rather than
yeah
more sort of um
flesh like than plasticky sort of
mm-hmm mm-hmm
wow
um but we have to take care like
but we have to take care of our children also if they means if children catch hold of your or if they chew it it shouldn't be too harmful
so whatever material we use it should be yeah
oh no ethics that's gonna cost us money
so we have to safety point of view also we have to take care
okay safety
oh i think wi with the more organic shape of it it won't be as it won't as have many sharp corners as that
so that's something good um
yeah
i dunno i mean
it sme smells good for children
we could go comp yeah
yeah
we could go completely out of the box and make the thing a big red ball foam ball
and it's got the thing on the inside
and there's no buttons at all it's always on and just yell at it and it works
that's a good idea
that sounds yeah it's gonna have to be it's gonna be have a big yellow foam ball yeah sorry
and then ch children will love it
interesting
oh yellow yellow ball
yeah d with the colour um does it have to be all yellow do you know
right
please god no
um
no
well i wouldn't th i mean my reaction to an all yellow remote control wouldn't be anything other than horror so i think just having it
yeah
small logo with the like a small yellow strip or y yellow with the logo in it
having a little bit
surrounding the logo
okay cool
mm mm
yeah
mm-hmm okay
cool
and i'll see if i can argue with boss about putting the what was it
we put we put fashion into
whoops it's not working
can't believe i've forgotten it
we put the fashion in electronics
oh yeah that's a good one that
i bet that'll catch on well
yeah so
okay any last
yeah
worries queries
twelve thirty
okay
s s i know what you're thinking
hmm
okay then lunchtime yay
that's good
okay that felt a bit more like a something with order and and reason to it than the last one
this is quite fun actually
wow
mm
has anybo oh
i really don't
has anybody pressed okay it vibrates
it's pretty cool
yeah yeah
yep
check here
wow you've your first page
i was just writing really big
yeah got small writing
yeah i've been using up the pages
i don't wanna waste it
i've finished the meeting now
another questionnaire
oh everybody needs k questionnaire
um we are so the meeting will have about the same format as the last time
so switching over i've just left uh my first two screens
mm-hmm
um i have
mailed you the minutes of the last meeting uh just to save time
okay
cool
um and is there any questions you have that arised from last meeting that
are particularly bothering you
mm um
n
no i don't think so
no
okay cool
no
then we shall start with a presentation from raj
yeah
hi me raj again
uh in this meeting i i'm going to discuss about the trend watching uh how these trends is going to affect our market potential and how important is this
so we have to look on this
first of all methodology
the met methodology to find out the trend was incl uh was done in a way we have done a rec not only a recent remote control market survey
but we also considered the latest fre fashion trends of the market because we think that this is also a factor which will affect our sales and profit
so what are our findings
in our uh in our findings we have seen that when we did our remote control market survey we found that uh people l uh people do have preference for tho fancy mobi uh f remote controls which look and feel very good
rather than having a functional look and feel uh good
so this sh this clearly indicates their preference for the design their outlook of the remote controls
so we should take into uh we should consider this factor as the most important factor because this factor is twice as important
the second factor which is further ti twice the as important as the sec as uh the third factor
so this factor becomes the most important factor in our surv uh uh in our mark uh means in take in designing our rem uh remote controls
the last one is the most important one is it
no the first one is the uh the outlook of the mobile the it should have a fancy outlook
oh sorry
okay
the fancy design uh rather than just having a functional look and feel good it should have a fancy look and foo feel good
okay
the second most important aspect is that remote control should be a technologically uh innovative
we must have some technological advancement in the remote control tha rather than just putting it as it is as the other remo uh remote controls are
so it uh should be technologically innovative like glow in the dark or speech recognition something like that
so that indicates our technological advancement
mm-hmm
and the third most important aspect in the ta to take into consideration is that it should be easy to use
mm-hmm
like it shouldn't be too much co complicated there shouldn't be too many buttons on this mobi uh remote control
it shouldn't be too complicated uh like this way
and it should be uh and customers should be provided with manuals that is easy to understand in their local language something
so that they could know how to use these remote controls
when we did uh f fashions uh recent fashion uh our recent fashion update shows that
sorry
ah yeah
i was just reading fruit and vegetables
hard to know how we are going to incorporate that
y yeah uh yeah we have to because uh d you can see how people have related their clothes shoes and everything with fruits and vegetables
because the g world is now changing it's trend towards organic becoming more and more organic becoming yeah
okay
yeah
we should make a big sponge lemon and then it'd be it would be yellow
yeah
so yeah
th that's very good
it's yeah
so something like that we we should do
glow in the dark
okay
and people uh the f feel of the material is expected to be spongy rather than just having a plastic look hard look
well that's good
mm
that's what we kind of predicted anyway
yeah
yeah
so so that they could play with it while handi uh while handling it
okay
so that should also be taken into consideration
okay
so these are my views
okay
okay the spongy not real spongy
so
you can do you think like rubber would be good or does it really want to be like gel kind of stuff
no it ca y a the rubber which is good for health and which is quite disposable that we can take into co yeah
okay
quite disposable
okay
'cause we it shouldn't be have any harm to the environment also because our company is very well for taking all these concerns into consideration
oh okay
alright okay
uh-huh
so we don't want to have any harm to the society so
okay
fashion
cool
mm 'kay
so that's all
fruit and veg well there you go
just what i think of when i think of a remote control
mm
a remote control
yeah
and were there any factors that weren't important in the survey that they said we don't want
s uh we didn't find out any such point
or was it just okay
uh yes there could be but we couldn't find out any so
mm mm mm mm
cool
mm mm mm mm mm
f. what is it
um
function f. eight
yeah
hmm
okay
yeah
no signal
oh no
is that
no it's got it's got it
yeah uh yeah uh yeah
excuse me
yeah
okay and then f. five right
uh yeah
okay
um
okay so the interface concept um
yeah
the interface specification what people um how they interact with it basically i think
um so the method we looked at existing designs what are the what's good about them
what's bad about them um i looked at their flaws so we're going to look at their flaws everything
um and what the survey told us and what we think would be good so a bit of imagination
mm 'kay
uh the findings i've got some pictures to show you as well
either
yeah
hmm
okay so most remote controls use graphical interface
where you um have got s buttons and you point it rather than having the output as a a stream of text or something
uh okay
um and we also found that there's inconsistent layout which makes it confusing
so i think for our remote control there is some inconsistency already in ec existing in between remote controls
but i think standard kind of um shape and uh play and those kind of but buttons like the the top right for on and off or something
i think people find that then it's easy to use
right okay
yeah
and we've got some pictures of some uh new remote controls to show you
do i press escape f. five
excellent
uh no just escape
or just
escape okay
should uh
um oh i still haven't got my glasses on
yeah okay
so these are the some of the pictures of existing ones
wow
i'll just walk you through them
this one is a voice recognition
and that's the kind of idea we're going for
'kay
looks pretty complicated
there's um an l. c. d. thing which we thought could i thought could get a bit confusing and a bit expensive as well for us
right okay
this one is got a kind of scroll like a mouse which yeah
mm-hmm like the middle button
okay
um and but i'm not exactly sure how you'd use that like would the computer come
ah it's kinda like scrolling uh right well
if i s if i'm thinking of the right one i've got the same thing in front of my monitor
you scroll it and the when you reach the sort of um menu item that you require you press the middle of the scroll
uh-huh that's like the l. c. d. one is it
right okay
but the one below that has got like a little scroll function on the side
but i presume that the functions must come up on the t. v. screen
yeah presumably
yeah
i think that's what that is
so these are just a few ideas
again that's just quite boring shape grey looks quite space agey but too many buttons i think on that one
yeah looks like uh looks like something out of a jet
uh it looks threatening
yeah it does look kind of dangerous
it looks like yeah
hmm
um this one i thought was really cool
it's w it's got the programmability function that we talked about
you can put it in there it's for your kids and it's quite an organic shape and the little circle around there is pretty cool
okay
and that's really easy to use bright so i like this one lot for our design
i think something like that would be good
wow
yeah i m i mean the one thing i think about about these ones is um these kl uh secured areas um
of course yellow
i've seen a lot of them with the the cover missing
right yeah
so like have it hinge rather than sort of clip on or whatever
yeah that's true
yeah
um so maybe that could be built into one of the things and it comes up on the t. v. or something
and this one the over sized one i don't know about you but i think it's a bit too gimmicky
yeah
i don't think that will sell very well
i mean is that not sort of to assist the blind or something is it
i guess so
i don't know
i think that's a bit
strange
then d blind don't watch t. v.
yeah exactly
no they do they do
they listen to it
they do
yeah
yeah
and um this one is just pointing out
i like some of these things um the the raised symbols and everything
but pointing out um that this one the volume it is kind of pressing down but it would actually go up because of the shape
right okay
so that could that's a bit confusing
um but the buttons on this i think are it's just showing you how you can have different different um buttons
they don't have to be all the same
so that's quite cool
um
'kay but people tend to recognise certain shapes to do certain things anyway don't they
yeah exactly
um f. five
yes
so there are some of the findings
so we need to combine those ones um and i've just got an e mail from our technical department saying that they have broken through with some new speech recognition software that you can program in
brilliant
that's handy
um yeah it is just in time very handy
um so i think maybe incorporating that in our design would be good
it's you program it like you say record um and then play and then
okay
record play machine and stuff like that so that's and it's much yeah
so that's quite cool
uh personal preferences just some imagination the raised symbols i thought were good the l. c. d. it does look smart
but i think maybe for our budget do you think that would be a bit too expensive to have the
the l. c. d. and the other stuff uh i think
yeah
and the speech recognition 'cause i think we're definitely going for the speech recognition are we
but in our market survey we have seen that people are willing to pay more
but they want the quality they want f fancy look they want some new design something new
uh-huh
okay
uh-huh
uh yeah
but our budget we've yeah
it's still it's still got to get within our twelve fifty you know
yeah
so even if we increase our cost little bit within uh some limits and we give something new technological advancement as well as new design with fancy outlook
uh-huh
i think we will meet the requirements and we will be able to have a good sales in the market
okay
i'm not sure if the if for twenty five euros uh per uh twelve euros fifty m manufacturing cost
okay
ben bana
yeah
i can't see tha although th i mean to be to be sure they have got i mean they are going crazy with the l. c. d. technology now
the l. c. d.
so that you've got your l. c. d. t. v. s and everything so maybe the small
yeah
but i mean like i i the black and white i guess it just doesn't look funky enough
no
um but i mean like even mobile phones or whatever have now have colour l. c. d. screens
w i ju i mean i wouldn't know about the costs of them
yeah
hmm
s
uh-huh
but uh price price not withstanding um is it too complicated is it gonna be too much just overload
twelve fifty
and the
uh i it will be easy because there will be on l. c. d. s screen
possibly
yeah that's the thing because
there will be different frent icons they can just click ok okay whatever they wa
but but the thing is when you use a remote control you never look at it right
yeah
you're looking at the t. v. and and it's uh it just seems kind of like a a needless th
yeah
yeah
that's true yeah
and one of the survey findings was that they want it easy to use so i think i'm not sure about the l. c. d.
right
it's a it's great it's a good idea but for our budget and for the thing we're trying to go for eas easy to use
it's not the thing we should go for i think
child friendly i thought this was good as you pointed out the um
the bit it often goes missing especially with children
but it's a good shape and the organic is kind of we could make a vegetabley kind of round shape i think
yeah
so which vegetable
well i mean we could make a yeah
yeah i know carrot
well si since we're going for the uh the k the sort of company colours
okay
i think your lemon wasn't that far s and if it doesn't work you know we've just made a lemon
the the lemon
yeah
well what are the options
but we don't want it to be yeah
um the child friendly yeah
easy to use it seems quite easy to use
i like the d the different shapes of the buttons and stuff
mm-hmm
i think that's a good idea to go for
i like i like the colourful buttons as well
yeah
and the mouse one i thought it was a good idea because people use mo mice mouses now with the scrolling thing
yeah
um
i mean we are marketing to sort of twenty five to thirty five so most people
yeah
will have come in contact with that kind of use
s yeah
so they'd be able to use that um as i said i think i i'd presume it would come up on the screen
yeah
um so there you go
and that means tha that means you get to bump that bit to the t. v. maker so
yeah
oh
so that's um the user interface
'kay
design
so okay i'll take this out now then
okay
um so
there you go
i guess there are a lot of options that we're gonna have to choose from among
yeah looks like it
and i'll i'll give you the uh i guess technical considerations for those
mm
uh
and i'm gonna use the whiteboard just 'cause we haven't used it
yeah i was just thinking the self same thing
right
so the way i'm gonna do this is uh we're gonna take a look at some old remote controls see how they work
uh reuse the the vital kind of um essential pieces of it and then we'll throw in our new innovations um and keep it all within budget
magic man
so uh yeah looking inside a a very simple remote control
um this is what they sent me
'kay
here's uh the competition i suppose
um you open it up there's a circuit board inside um and there's a a chip
mm-hmm
a processor the t. a. one one eight three five which um receives input from the buttons and ch
so this is a standard off the shelf kind of a chip is it
right it's very they're very cheap remote
this remote costs nothing you know
um so that takes a signals from the buttons and translates it into a sequence of pulses that it then sends to the to the amplifier
which is made of some transistors and amplifiers
op amps and then that gets sent to the uh to the l. e. d. light
which i can kinda see is that little red light bulb at the end and that sends out the infrared uh light signal to the television
mm-hmm
right
oh here it is
um so this is kind of the the bear essentials that we need to have in our remote control because it it defines the uh
okay
so can we make them to pretty much any size we like or is there a minimum or
r um no i mean this is a very old one so now with the new technology this is a a minimally small and cheap thing to make
they gotta be
almost a key ring
right
so this is what we need to have for certain
okay
um
so you know as we said we got the outer casing which we have to decide you know what's it gonna be
um the board we have to use basically uh the same set up
processor um we'll probably use the more advanced processor than they had amplifier and transmitter are all standard
um so for the casing uh this an e mail i got from our manufacturing team
uh you know we have a bunch of options from wood titanium rubber plastic whatnot
um latex double curved curved
so lots of choices what do we think
'kay
uh or sponge i guess isn't on there right
well
mm
organic sponge
well i mean like la latex has a kinda spongy feeling to it doesn't it
i'm not sure about the sponge
um
uh yeah it's very elasticy for sure
yeah
yeah
and that would k also give it kinda durability and
yeah
um
and ther that's also f sorta relatively cheap to cast
yeah so
um so maybe s uh a sort of uh plastic initial plastic with a a latex kinda sheath
okay so here are a a plastic
uh latex
i like the rubber the stress balls i think you know that could be a bit of a gimmick like it's good to hold and
oh right okay
oh right
i don't know what that stuff is
so something with give to it
yeah
yeah
okay
and that might be quite durable and easy to chuck around
and
and the colour is yellow right
yeah y yellow incorporated yeah
or at least incorporating yeah
yellow okay
um
i mean i forgot i we're sort of uh
i don't know what other standard silver kind of
i think
mm
other parts or uh
yeah the buttons w like
'cause there's gonna be the the cover the the rubber or the plastic casing and then the buttons in probably two different colours or i if we're having buttons actually
mm-hmm
mm' kay
so yellow for the body and then what colour for the buttons
i don
um
um i quite like the multi coloured buttons myself
yeah
so multi coloured buttons
you do have ones like um play could be green or on and off is red and stuff like that yeah
yeah or yeah a limit uh maybe even just a limited multi colour so it it doesn't look too childish perhaps
makes it easy to use
yeah that's true because that blue one did look quite hardish
okay
yeah
although i mean this uh uh also comes to shape as well
i mean if we are gonna make it a novel i mean double curved sounds good to me if we're talking about sorta ergonomic and easy use
okay
mm-hmm
mm-hmm
yeah
a bit comfier you know
yeah
mm 'kay so the shape we wanna go
um how exactly
maybe
double
like uh an hour glass kind of figure is that what you're thinking of or just like a
yeah it's uh yeah that that'd be that's sort of comfortable to hold easy to hold so you don't drop it
it's not yeah
what about a banana
we could make novelty remote controls
yeah
okay like we could have a big banana shaped remote control 'cause it's yellow fruit right
well yeah i mean like
yeah yeah
mm and a lemon might be a little hard to grip
yeah
but then how would you point it
ah yeah
yeah
mm-hmm
how would you point it
oh i it doesn't matter which end you point i guess
what
we could have a little l. e. d. s on each end
yeah i appreciate this idea because then this this will help us in our advertisement also and we can relate with fruits and vegetables the people's choices
they only cost pennies
that what our data shows that so this w this w
yeah
y i'm i'm not sure about the banana idea
huh
um
so a spongy banana re yeah
i mean that that th
rubber banana
okay
does it does seem a bit uh again childish maybe
yeah
okay okay
i think maybe just draw on the kind of fruit and vegetable shape
and what else did you say about fashions
what was trendy
uh the fashion trend shows that fruits and vegetables like people uh now
s
see
and sponginess
and spongy yeah
so maybe an an unidentifiable fruit or fiable fruit or vegetable like so it would have a stem perhaps and a
spongy
yeah
yeah
maybe yeah
maybe a it'd be s axially symmetric
huh
like what's what's that i don't even know the name of it some kind of
you know where it's like looks like a little snowman kind of thing
i don't know the name of that
so it'd look like this kinda
yeah that's what i was thinking
like a gourd almost or a squash of some sort
uh
yeah maybe that's what they are
'cause that you can hold it in like the bottom bit and
yeah and it has a a clear top and bottom so y so you could say you know it transmits from this end
yeah
yeah why the hell not
let's that'll make us fifty million euros
i don't know
what do you guy what do you think
um
well
i guess it's kind of dra uh you don't necessarily have to have it sort of clearly identified as a fruit just to have that kind of fruitish shape
no
yeah
yeah
yeah
yeah then only we can relate it with something
yeah we can relate it by advertising or
yeah
exactly
okay so double curved single curved what do we feel
yeah
or we can do something we can design two three shapes and we can have a public survey let the public choose what they want
uh-huh
there's a good man
okay
there's a good idea
okay
okay um i guess since you're the marketing guy
yeah sure
we'll uh
i will be happy to do that
okay we could do that
um
okay
and buttons would did we say
uh different shapes of buttons
um i l i su i mean for the specific functions you know up and down uh play stop
mm
okay so
they've got i mean they've got standard sort of intuitive um
so buttons
things that are always used
okay just like that
that's cool
yeah
i like it
okay
um
with the scroll wheel or no
yeah what about the scroll wheel and speech recognition
uh speech recognition i think so we need a microphone presumably
okay uh i could put the microphone here
mm-hmm
okay there's the microphone
yeah
where should i put the microphone
i mean ho h h wel are we sure that scroll wheel does give ease of use
yeah i'm not sure
um i mean those ideas i saw were just for inspiration i think
glad we're not doing this for real
um yeah i can no i'm not sure
okay well we can do some user test with scroll wheels right
i couldn
yeah
yeah
okay
and uh i think if this this new software for the sound recognition is the microphone
yeah
okay
so should the microphone be just anywhere on it or
i would put it sort of sub centrally so it's yeah
yeah
'kay there's the mic
so it can be sort of held and w we really need really gonna need to hold it if it's gonna be voice recognition
that's cool
um n well we can
whoops
oops
um
um
so let's not use the whiteboard any more
yeah
um
upsidaisy
oops sorry
okay
and uh so what else was there
um the what about the glow in the dark thing the strip around it
are we just gonna leave that
i s i still like it
um but that's me
you still like it
'cause we've got the uh technological innovation with the speech recognition system
right
yes or maybe it's just going a bit uh too far
i mean we are pushing it probably with funny fruit shapes
'cause um it could yeah
um don't wanna sort of overkill
especially with yellow
mm
i dunno
hmm
'cause i mean like uh if we i mean how good is the speech recognition thing
do we want to go for buttons at all do we want to just have a device that maybe sits and pretends it's a fruit
then you put it in the fruit bowl
they can work from a you don't have to hold it
yeah you know and then you just tal i mean like everybody's got fruit bowl in front of the telly
yeah
mm-hmm
i it could even encourage healthier habits for television watchers you know they have uh fruits all round them
um
yeah
yeah
make them make them think of fruit yeah
now just make sure they don't eat the remote
yeah
i mean uh some uh i l like think of a fruit that could sit sort of independently on its own like uh i dunno an apple
yeah do we need buttons
mm
then it's just apple so sort of uh yellow apples though hmm
yeah
i quite like the shape
i quite like the design of that uh 'cause that could sit on its own and it's quite got a quite steady base
yeah
okay yeah that's good
groovy
okay
um
but yeah
and as we say we n we don't wanna be too ridiculous with the fruit things you know
yeah
but yeah about the speech thing it doesn't have to be hand held or close
it can sit at a distance and pick it up still
yeah
okay
so i mean like you could actually
yeah gives you the options
or we can we can do one thing we can just have a remote control and casings of different different shapes
different fruit shapes in such a way that a any casing can be could be fit into this mobile general piece
mm-hmm
mm-hmm
so whatever people want like if somebody want it in banana shape
we will put that casing onto that mobile phone okay it will look l uh yeah
mm-hmm
so a selection of casings
yeah 'cause you said about disposable didn't you
in that w
it kind of fi it fits with f fits with marketing um
s s sorry
you said about disposable earli people want disposable things so we could do that like have a choice
uh like if this is a like if this is a mobile phone uh we will design casing in such a way like half of
we need not to have a full cover we will just have a half of cover okay
yeah
like like mobiles yeah
if somebody wants it i in banana shape we will fit banana shape casing onto that so it will give a banana shape look
yeah
if somebody wanted in apple shape we will design that we will put we will put apple shape casing on that
it will give apple shape look
okay
so in that way you can have any that means whatever you want without uh yeah
okay
we still need the buttons in the same places thought don't we
yeah button will be on the upper side buttons will be the on the upper side
you can standardise those i mean
oh that's the other side
yeah buttons will be on the upper side lower side we will just put the casing
oh okay
so half of that will be look the yeah not not the upper side
oh half a fruit
oh okay okay
so from lower you can it means while you are holding of from this side you c you can have banana look or apple look whatever
okay okay
so in that way we need not to d have different different shape mobiles everything we will just design casings fruit shape
okay
yeah yeah
i think tho i think if you're gonna have a facia then you'd want to have it so that it does go over the buttons
and
'cause when if you think about it if they're wanting it 'cause they want to look at it
if they're using it and what they want to look at is facing away from them
mm mm
it doesn't really
you know 'cause that'd be in the palm of their hand and they wouldn't be able to see it
yeah
unless you have sort of you got the buttons options on one side
and you get the facia on the other side with a microphone so that you can place it face down
and you've got the facia and you can just talk at the
mm-hmm
maybe
okay um so
so you've narrowed it down to half a dozen options
yeah s i guess we decided on material right
so that that spongy latex rubber everything feel
yeah
yeah
and the colours we got down and the shape maybe we'll just make it kinda mix and match type of shape or
yeah
yeah
well um because well i i'm not sure if we should go so far in the whole fruit thing
because i think we should maybe just take the inspiration from the fruit and uh because what yeah
okay so we stick with what we've got there
w i think wh wha would we're trying to get to twenty five thirty five year olds who want it quite trendy as well they said
they wanted something that looks fancy and i think maybe fruit could be a bit of a too much of a gimmick but something ergonomically shaped and organic
like good to hold based on fruits and natural things like that because al already we're going a bit gaudy with the yellow you know
mm 'kay
yeah
mm-hmm
i mean we could make it nice pale yellow
well it's kind of gotta be our company's yellow
okay
okay
okay
so again i mean like we could have uh i mean we could quite easily have the the main body be a different
yeah
maybe we could have that pale yellow and then an outside bit bright yellow with you said the logan the slogan
colour but have
kinda going round yeah
mm
because
um i mean e even if i mean not necessarily that the um the whole body has to be of the company colour
so you know um blue and yellow tend to go to we well together
yeah
so you have the main body blue with the yellow logo and slogan running up one side of it kind of thing
yeah
yeah
uh-huh
mm-hmm
w sort of
great
um as for the energy source um you know almost every remote control uses just batteries but we don't have to be limited by that
we can use a hand dynamo
um i don't know what that means we crank it
uh it's i think it's basically the more you move i it it's got a wee thing inside that just kinda powers it
right it's like those watches that you c so
uh yeah
this might be an idea for something that people really wanna grab you can shake it if it's out of power
oh a d a dynamo
yeah
yeah
yeah i like that yeah
yeah like with those watches that you kind of twist
yeah
yeah that's quite cool
okay
so if it if it's not working i guess people's natural reaction anyway is to just shake the thing
okay
but
you shake it and scream at it
yeah
but but do you think that it will be a good idea to use dynamo tha these type of cells
yeah it is yeah
because then people have to well like if the cell is out of bat yeah to mo yeah
it does leave them with an obligation to especially if they want to use it uh uh sp uh specifically as um voice activated
yeah because most of the people yeah
then if it's just sitting on the
right
yeah then they have to pick it up and then activate it and then yeah
okay okay
that's true
okay
right um what are the other options
uh there's solar power
uh solar power will w also not be a good idea because then they have to keep m their mobiles outside in solar energy
um
yeah
yeah
and the days when there is no sola sunlight yeah
i'm i'm with uh raj on that i think you know
okay so probably just
yeah
i've got i've got no i've got a north facing house there's not really ever sun coming in my window
what we w yeah
but w like just normal light
i think we should a rechargeable battery will be a good idea
oh that's true
they can they can recharge it
i mean i w i w uh that idea that i thought um just on the basis of like ridding them of batteries and that kind of bother is having a
mm
and we're a very environmentally friendly company aren't we as well
yeah having a rechargeable stand so that not only it doubles as a stand
yeah
yeah
yeah
but um for using it as uh recharging it but also for using it as sound recognition
yeah
'kay
like like a hand like one of those portable phones kind of thing
yeah that kind of thing
yeah that's yeah exactly
okay
so uh a rechargeable battery
yeah
yeah
okay
rechargeable
um the user interface the buttons i guess we talked about this already
mm
what's chip on print
um
what's
hmm
sorry never mind
uh th the uh the electronics um basically the more features we add um
oops this one
so the more features we add the fancier chips we need to buy and put in which adds to the cost as you can expect
mm-hmm
mm-hmm
um
but uh i think we can keep it all under budget
so uh yes so the speech thing you said our our techno our research and development department came up with some break through
mm-hmm
so just in time
yeah and if we if we're just having buttons and the speech then we're getting our cheapest option of
just in time
chipping
right right
that's good
uh woah
yeah and keeping the l. c. d. screen out
okay we're we're kind of uh we're kind of um excuse m i've just deleted that whole thing
um we're kind of running out of time so if you could
uh
was that you
um that was your bit's covered i just dele i just accidentally deleted what i was supposed to say next
huh
oh yeah that was that was it
uh excuse me bri
um yeah
so control f. eight right
oh yeah
yeah mine seems to have turned off
i can't do anything
and i just touch the pad
you just touch the pad yeah
no
it's actually shut down
no
it's on but there's nothing on the screen
okay
um now what we have uh our next meeting's in half an hour and what i would like you guys to do is work on giving me a model in clay
try uh flipping the screen down
'kay
oh i get to do it too
yeah
cool
it's you guys
oh neat
yeah
so um you know i mean luckily we chose a nice simple shape
yeah
yeah yeah
mm
um and further instructions will be sent by your personal coaches
okay
that's great
okay
save everything to the shared documents is that right
uh yeah i hope i can recover this 'cause i've accidentally deleted it
yeah
mm-hmm
which doesn't really help me much
i think i've saved mine already
yeah can you save that uh send that last one again please raj as i still can't find it on the
yeah
uh it was under a different name
i will show you in shared documents
okay
uh working components
oh you didn't get that
no
i will send new
okay thank you
uh i'll put it in shared documents again
um yeah project project documents
project documents sorry i put it in the shared documents
uh right that's that's the that it goes there automatically if you put it in project documents
uh yeah
project documents is on the um desktop
right that's great
but i cou can't open that because it w asks uh for some username or password
oh
really
i'll show you
uh these lapel mics are trouble
ts
oh right i think um hold on
sorry
uh
yeah i don't know if y it it just ca it just came up on my um
on my agenda
s um presumably there's clay somewhere
um
four
yeah that's great
whoops
light light please
light
right there you go
yeah th thank you
yeah quite
and we're using this our basic chip set so it's all good
oh sorry
are we done with our meeting
uh excuse me brian
um i think we're almost done yeah
you have to keep your pen separate because i used your pen
yeah
oh oops
sorry man
s
uh okay still didn't manage to get down all the last bits so we had rechargeable and
uh
apples
mm mm mm mm mm
'kay so we came up with that that's okay
what's supplements
supplements
uh uh
see
cool
fun
i shoulda something like that
if i kn see i i knew that
i shoulda sort of engineered it so we k ended up making a diffi difficult shape
hmm
just for cruelty
yeah
hmm
star fruit
i wonder if they mean like literally make it sort of buttons and everything
so sh should
no
should we leave now brian
oh yeah we can do buttons
or we are going to discuss something
um
uh no i think that's us our discussion over unless anybody's got questions or confusions 'cause i'm confused
no i'm good
yeah
huh
okay
excuse me
um uh we'll probably get questionnaire in a minute it's a
mm
sorry
thank you
yeah
there we go
warning finish meeting now
so
i rounded it up far too fast
um
where are we going
my documents that's not what i want
my project documents
there we go
okay
okay almost there
okay
we'll sta i'll use the powerpoint i guess
how was that was that fun
mm
yeah yeah
very fun
okay
uh oh i've forgotten to mail you the minutes but i will do
okay
upsidaisy
hmm
um um we yeah
e excuse me i forgot my
alright okay yeah
copy
he's gonna get his pen
oh right
okay
um will you guys first with your prototype
um before we get to the good news
yeah there's good news
uh we have budget problems
oh
mm
oh
cutbacks
i'm afraid you're all sacked
oops
i don't even have this on
hmm
okay have you got a presentation to make
okay
no not mine yet
no
okay so it's just your your show
oh
um maybe we should bring so that the camera can see
yeah
okay
sure
okay
we made three for you
three
oh
um one's based on the banana one's based on the tomato and the other one is st
tomato
what tomato
i don't recall a tomato
look
oh yeah well yeah we had v some red left over
so
ah i see okay
okay so this is the um non to non uh no buttons one or as mm few buttons as possible mainly speak recognition
mm-hmm
the yellow there is the um the slogan yeah that we need to incorporate it's very simple
logo
okay brilliant
if you do need buttons you can flip it over and there's some there um but mainly it's speech recognition
okay
okay so the buttons would be like you know individual users or yeah
yeah
yeah and yeah they might project things onto the screen which you can do on there
alright okay
mm i'm not sure about that
um and this one is the one w more like the one w that we looked at earlier
right
yeah you guys can have a look at that if you want
that's groovy
yeah
well i like the feel of it i like the feel of it
uh can i have
yeah sure
um that one is oh no it's delicate
oh sorry s
at oh dear
that's that's already got its stand that one
that's it stand
alright okay
it does also lie flat but that's the that yellow stand there represents the the charging stand
okay brilliant mm
um the black on the back is the slogan
okay nice and obvious there if it's standing up i guess yeah
uh yeah that well we did think of that
yeah if it's standing up it's it's on there but also we're gonna have the company name on the front
which is the little black kind of line in the middle
oh right okay brilliant
like that from its centre
so um and that's the um transmit the l. e. d. thing
these are the s two scroll ones which we thought could be channel up and down and volume up and down
we n were weren't sure about putting them there because um i it's it kind of could get bashed
where you're yeah uh were you're holding it kind of
yeah
well if you hold it you can you all can hold it is it does actually feel quite ergonomic if you've got small hands
mm-hmm
yeah
mm
um obviously i don't think that's real sized
okay
it would have to be a bit bigger
yeah okay
yeah scale model yeah
okay
um that's a speaker at the top so you can speak into it like a little walkie talkie as well for speak recognition
mm-hmm
um and um then the buttons
yeah kind of self explanatory just buttons whenever you need them
tried to keep it simple
oh that's the charging base prongs at the bottom
alright excellent
we used those
and um then the big red button in the middle is the on and off one
it's not in the traditional place but um it's quite an obvious place
okay
no
it's out of the way as well i suppose so
excellent
so there we go and and um we have the banana based one too
oh yeah yeah
yep
this one is uh i suppose for the younger audiences
okay so so barney the banana
a a more friendly type of
right right
it's to uh induce more television watching i suppose or
ah excellent just what we need
yeah
yeah
say it for the camera
lo sort of loch ness banana
mm-hmm
mm-hmm
right right
cool yeah
well nice to have uh options at least
yeah
yep
so are there any um improvements or issues or
'kay and
it won't stand
oh there are issues oh there are issues
just let it lie down it wont stand
um main problem that we have unfortunately being finance
oh
uh let's just enter in the um evaluation criteria
um unfortunately
the unit we are currently going to produce minus the extra scroll buttons uh it's gonna cost us fourteen point six euros
mm
oh
so we have to rea sorry i've accidentally highlighted somehow um
what's on the uh on the left
there we go
okay
oh god why is it doing that
ooh
there we go
so basically um in order to save our two euros
um i was thinking
that we could have essentially the same shape but just have it flattened
mm-hmm
more like a traditional remote control
um
yeah i mean it's already got a kind of cool shape so but it wouldn't have to be curved sort of in and out
mm-hmm
mm-hmm
and by doing so oh no hold on
doesn't save us quite as much
i don't know what's going on with this again
w why is the uh double curved two of them
oh good point
and double curve on both sides
um
curve
yeah this is double curve no
that's sort of curve in and out
this is double curve
is i
it this one is single curve
mm
'cause this is single curve this is curved on both sides
so double curve
no i think it means double curved as in um like uh a single curve on that bottom half
like an s. shape
and the double curved would be if it was that similar curve upward
okay
okay i might be wrong though
like this one curve on this side one curve on that side
i don't think that counts as a curve i think that's just a shape
hmm
hmm
okay
a curvature is like the this case
maybe
'cause that's the uh the biggest expense there right
okay
yeah and why why i've got it two i don't know i can't seem to select any more however
got two of them
okay
well we can work around that um
mm-hmm
right
no
cut things out
but you think it should be one
it's meant to be one yeah i don't know why i put two in there
okay
but um hold on till i find it i think this shift button might be stuck again
no maybe the shift button's stuck in
yeah
um okay so that would take away three which would give us
mm
should
oh that's fine
yeah so we're
eleven uh eleven euros sixty
cool
cool
um
so we could even add something
we cou oh not quite have the scroll wheel unfortunately
we should fire the accountants
what
fire the accountants
ah yeah we could add things
maybe if you click back in that bottom right cell where you're starting from and then use the arrow keys
yeah
does that work
yeah i know that just extends it as well
no mm
uh you can do one thing
i don't know
you just select one box outsi yeah this box
then move it with the help of this okay
it one of the buttons is sticking i don't know
just uh just uh okay just a minute
okay
no input like this
shift
no it's not
no it's 'cause the uh the shift button's stuck or something
yeah it's not working
is it the other shift button maybe
should we ask meli should we ask our technical expert melissa
no that's fine
um we've worked out what it would be anyway
did you try both shift buttons
it could be the other side
yeah
cancel
piss off
that's too bad
oh well never mind
um
right so that's finances and i dunno what we what could we reckon we could add
um
well maybe we could add something but maybe if what do you th we're trying to save money so
well i suppose that's our that's that's our design that we've got
yeah if we're happy with the design there's no point in spending money if we don't have to
so
yeah
but if there is anything you think we've missed out there then you know feel free to add it
maybe i mean obviously it would be bigger so there might be more space for the the slogan on the front
because it's not in an ideal place right now
yeah yeah
well that's that's uh okay so project evaluation
we have under twelve euros fifty
project process how do we think that went
are we happy
oh
mm
yeah i think we have a a winning product
okay
evaluation
oh we've been writing this up for m months
i think it went quite smoothly
uh room for creativity were we happy with that
w i think we were very creative
no i mea i think it means sort of individually
oh right okay
yes no maybe
mm-hmm
okay
groovy
so uh we're just gonna
uh yeah okay
teamwork
leadership sorry
great leadership
excellent leadership
thank you very much
you're all get you're all getting a raise
uh teamwork
i thought went well
yeah yeah
yeah
yeah everyone got enough input i think
yeah
uh and well means yeah
yeah we
the technical stuff was brilliant
let's buy more
yeah
uh right
yeah
um i don't know what new ideas found means to be honest
these pens are are neat though
yeah these are new ideas like glow in the dark or something like that
we discussed all the new ideas but of course we couldn't reach any proper goals
we couldn't use these but we h we are using these scroll buttons like this
mm-hmm
mm-hmm
these are new ideas we and new shapes everything
yeah
mm 'kay
at le yeah
groovy
so just general thumbs up for all of us then
hmm
that kind of unfortunately is too quick
okay
hmm
okay
well um
uh
i suppose yeah
uh so let's talk about our bonuses and the raises we're getting for this right
um
that's it um i think another couple of days holiday pay might be well in order for all of you
mm
right right
uh let's see if i can get this bloody thing to work
uh maybe we should start cleaning up the clay
whoops
yeah maybe
so
does it go back in does it
reusable
something we should get
i don't know what this is but it's really really annoying
so
uh brian have you have you finished
uh-huh
um i have yes
uh mine needs also this
huh
at last mine is also the presentation
oh right okay you've got more okay
yeah yeah
oh you got a presentation sorry
sorry uh
oh ok
it didn't bother to tell me that on this
s
thing
is it
okay
uh is the project evaluated that is mine
doesn't tell me
oh you're doing that
yeah
we evaluated ourselves we thought we were great
yeah
uh
mm love to eat that now
anybody
kind of a green banana now
mm
clay covered banana
it's this as well sorry we forgot to mention it'll be made out of kind of a rubbery latex new material that we've got
o okay hold on
i've got
blue
i wonder w which cell do i want
it's fun to touch
yeah
so
okay i didn't realise you had that bit
yeah
so
oh could you pass the tomato please
sorry
thank you
so now is the final evaluation final evaluation of the uh uh of our product
mm-hmm
how we are going to means uh at what standard what standard whether it meets our standards or not
how mu what rating we will give to these products
so of course this is will be a team work w we together have to decide wha what rating we will give to this product and everything
okay
so what methodology i will tell you on what basis we are going to discuss all this
we will give the rating to this product based on the user requirements whether it meets the user requirements or not this product
then trends whether it is as fashion trends or not
means because we have already stated that people do prefer fashionable things nowadays
mm-hmm
so this is also an important factor for our evaluation also
then marketing strategy of the company
as we have already discussed that our company is quite in the market not only in terms of providing quality products
not only in pro providing latest technologies but also in terms of providing environmental s
sorry
sorry carry on
yeah
so but also in terms of providing environmental safe products uh yeah like uh keeping uh keeping in mind all the safety issues
so
now comes the criteria rating with seven point scale
okay
i'm having this scale this scale so we have to do it on a board
mm-hmm
okay
alright okay
the user requirem i think
the board working again is it
do we have the uh the marker for the board
uh
um
thank you
there it is
so
so these are the three crite criterias for our evaluation of our product
mm-hmm
first of all uh comes user requirement
so we will see whether this product meets all user requirements or not
i i will first i would like to have your views what do you think whether it meets all user requirements or not
um i think
yeah it did
it had all the basic buttons that they needed as well as the uh new technology that people said they wanted
s
yeah
um so
when the user requirement is essentially just to operate the t. v. so yeah of course we haven't actually got a working model yet
does it work
yeah
so
so what do you think you will personally give
i would say seven
seven
uh
seven is good yeah isn't it
i can't true or false
no sorry tr one is true
one yeah
uh one is means highest ranking okay
yeah
but i think highest ranking is seven or one
no it's it's like true is one end and false is the oth
no that's false
okay right right
okay so one
so it's one for from your point of view
yep
and what do you say our industrial expert
uh
it's hard to know
i i give it a two
uh d you can you can tell on on the like i think she has given her views on the basis of design
because she was our i interface expert
okay
but you can give your views based on technology whether the technology meets the requirements of the customers or not
um yeah i think i it might even exceed it um
but i guess there is a kind of a shortage of buttons
um i'm gonna give it a two
two
two
and what about uh you brian
oh i'll go for a one
you will go for one
basic requirements but of the pro of the project
okay
uh for me personally it is everything fine it may be having good design
it may be uh meeting all the requirements of the customers like technology wise price wise
but there is one thing which limits the customers like we are having only two three designs
like we are having one banana design and the other one is orange and uh yeah lower end
yeah th
mm yellow
and the third one is what you ge uh that is not a f fruit look
uh-huh
but if a person doesn't like banana or orange you are limiting him
come on that was the tha
'kay
uh-huh
no don't buy our product because we are l we like this only
okay
so we are showing our preference for particular fruits two or three kinds rather and yeah
being fruitist
is that no is that not trends
so
uh no uh personally as a marketing expert i don't believe that because whatever companies they launch their products in the shape of fruits
they give a range of products a range of shapes like if we see
look at the smallest thing toffee chocolates they give a variety of different things
mm-hmm
some children like to buy banana shape some apple shape some even pineapple shape some orange shape
mm-hmm
so you can what shape a person will like
so in this case giving only one or two choices we are lim limiting our customers
and by limiting them we are limiting our sales limiting our profit also
uh-huh
but in electronics i think it's not q always quite so um you don't always have so many choices as with chocolates
i think you know if you're going to buy a t. v. maybe a company'll have that you're going to choose from
a company'll have two or three choices but they're different designs
we were coming up with one product
uh maybe
okay but i will i will personally won't give it beyond three
no i mean uh obviously your opinion i'm just trying to
okay
so we can
he's a tough cookie
yeah on an average we can think three four sevenths maybe
three or four
uh no sorry it should be
six
five or six
what are we doing
no sorry sorry sorry sorry we are doing a very wrong thing
what are we doing
adding them up
we're gonna average them
yeah yeah we are taking everything and that's i have taken it very wrongly
okay
oh
so seven fourths
yeah uh three four four two six seven seven sev yeah one pe exactly
about one point f one point eight
so we can say one or two
okay
okay
because it is one point eight uh two so we will do two
oh i see
yeah round it up to two
yeah
okay yeah
so where were the trends
so trends
can you explain what you want us to write there
sorry
how it how conforms to the current trends
yeah again the the fashion trends this also like whether it it will be fashionable to have these products in the uh as a fruit shape or something
mm-hmm
okay
uh
well um going on uh the specifications that we had that fruit and vegetables are quite popular
and that people like something that is good to look at and not many buttons
i would give it um well because it's hard to make a fruit good to look at
that that looks cool you know so i would actually give it a three
tha three or four i'm not sure
three
okay
go for three
yeah
that's fine
uh
'kay
as far as the uh technology it its' got the latest trends in speech technology but it's missing the screen
as we said um but it does have the push buttons or the scroll buttons
um but it doesn't have that fancy solar power or the the vibrating energy mechanism
so i give it a a four
i'd give it a kinda middle of the road for
mm
for technology
yeah i am sort of pret uh just the fruit does me in i mean uh it might
it might be trendy to some but i'm just not swallowing the fruit
so um uh also uh i would have liked to have seen the l. c. d. screen in it
yeah
um so yeah i'd say about four as well
okay
uh personally i wi uh i think that in terms of trends these products are quite good like these products are in fruit shape
because that wha people now our fashion trend shows that people like everything all f everything that is being advertised like clothes
shoes and everything is being advertised in the form of fruits and vegetables or getting them or showing some association with them
mm-hmm
so and in this way our product is good
and the second thing now people don't want any complicated or bulky products and ours is quite simple and quite handy
mm-hmm
so that is also ef that also our product meets the f the fashion uh trends of the market
and yes
it is cus spongy also
so they can play with it it's quite good
so then i think maybe i can give it two
so four five ten thirteen thirteen
so we can is it fine
so what about company strategy
yeah
well it was yellow
um
yeah the company strategy okay
um there was lot of discussing that was good
um i feel i got my say
um so i'd give the company strategy
a
two
okay
well i think it's the the remote control conforms to the the company strategy
okay
yeah yeah
is that the question
is it
okay
um
okay so
one or two
yeah
one
okay just leave it it's fine
i'll go with two
so what about you brian
um yeah a three
pretty much kept to the company strategy so i would go for a
a one as we not only kept it but we were limited by
mm
yeah and me also like this product me uh me uh me uh this meets all company strategy like our product should be as per customers' requirement
as per latest technology and it should be environmental safe
so since our product meets all these requirements so i would also prefer to give it rank one
so four six six
so one and a half
yeah one
half
so we can say two or one okay
a two
so th seven seven
uh overall we are getting two something but we can round it as two
yep
okay
cool groovy
yeah
so i think overall uh evaluation of our product is quite good
s
cool
so we can launch it
yeah
brilliant
woo hoo
in which case we are done
'cause we've evaluated and we are within budget
okay
cool
so yeah
champagne lunch anyone
yeah
uh
great
okay
so this is uh first meeting of
this design project
um and i um like to show you the agenda for the meeting i don't know if it was sent round to all of you
mm yeah
maybe not
i didn't receive it yet
anyway this is the the plan for today's meeting is um firstly just to introduce the project briefly
um although i'm sure you've actually got some of the information already
then the main purpose is to so that we get to know each other a little bit more
mm-hmm
um then we want to practice using some of the tools that we'll be using during the the course of the design project and the meetings
um specifically the whiteboard over there
um then we need to go through the specifics of our project plan um and discuss come up with some preliminary ideas about it
and then that's it
so we've got twenty five minutes to do that that's until eleven twenty five
so sh
s so any any questions
is i
not at this point
not at this point
so this is our project
what we're aiming to do is to create a new remote control for a television
um we want it to be something original something trendy and also something user friendly
so it has to be quite intuitive that people are able to use this product
the method that we're going to use to complete the project that has three components as such
there's the functional design of the the remote control
we're going the way we'll do that i think is to to work individually initially and then come together for meetings to to work on that
um similarly with the conceptual design we'll start off by working individually with our own expertise on our own laptops and then we'll bring what we've done together
um and then the detailed design will come after that
we'll pull it all together
i'm a bit confused about uh what's the difference between the functional design and conceptual design
uh i is it just uh more detail uh as i understand it
i think it th w we're talking the the functional design is more your
um area of things where you'll be we want to look at what functions we need in the remote control and what what specific things it it has to do but the conceptual design is um perhaps bigger than that and includes the how people are going to use it and and that kind of thing
right
how how it will be done
so whe where do we identify the components of our uh product
uh i think it's it's in the conceptual design phase that we identify the it's in the conceptual design phase that we identify the components of our product
um i think we'll we'll start that initially with the functional design already but then yeah
okay
okay so that's just a brief overview of the p the the project itself
um what i'd like us to do now is simultaneously introduce ourselves and start using some of the tools that we're using for for the project specifically the whiteboard
hmm
so each person in turn i'd like us to go up to the whiteboard
the pen's just underneath it there and draw your favourite animal and then tell everyone what the f your favourite characteristics of that animal are and while you're doing that tell us your name
what your role is and perhaps how your animal relates to the role that you're taking in this project
why are you looking at me
would you like to go first
do i have a choice
okay
ooh ooh things falling everywhere
oh yeah p put them in pockets
right okay
cool
you don't have to hurry we've got plenty of time
okay
so my name's cat and i'm really not very good at this whole drawing malarkey so um
okay
it's got no eyes
oh good point
ah the eyes always ruin it
right
okay what do it's eyes like
okay cool
um this is a rabbit
i thought it might be a cat
yeah well origi uh at first i thought it was going to be cat
yeah i don't think it's furry enough so we'll make it a fluffy rabbit
yeah now i now i understand now yeah
yeah i can see by the ears
yeah
okay right it's a fluffy rabbit blue
rabbits don't come in blue but you know
um okay and i like it because it's small and it's fluffy
mm
and one day you'll be able to getical genetically modify them and they will come in pink
ah
okay
excellent and what's your what's your role within the team
mm
i am the um i need my notebook mm ooh top banana
thank you
okay cool i am the marketing expert um so like
i'm gonna be doing the apparently according to the little guy in the computer that knows everything the user g requirements specification of the functional design
um trend watching in the conceptual design and product evad valuation in the detailed design um so yeah
mm-hmm
mm-hmm
okay
and more about yourself you're from
'kay
um i'm from leicester um second year
mm-hmm
um what else do you want to know
i like sports um yeah aerobics kickboxing spinning um and uh
but not with rabbits
not with rabbits no no
mm
and vets i like vets as well
and yeah um and i like cocktails especially pink ones
cool
okay
excellent to match the rabbit
cool
okay
um so my name is maarika
where's the pen
okay
there's a an if you have not enough room there's an eraser there and you can rub it off
yeah well or i can make it smaller
uh so um um i'm the interface designer in this project and my favourite animal
i m i mean i'm not so sure because i'm not so so very um familiar with all kinds of animals but i do like dogs
oh sorry maybe i should have shouldn't have said it beforehand but mm-hmm
mm
um well there are different kinds of dogs but okay um
that's not bad at all
ah it looks like a dog
yep
okay
is a bit more impressive than my rabbit
i think it needs four legs if it's gonna walk though
yeah maybe it has some colourful patches yeah
the other legs are on the other side
um yeah and i do like dogs because they are good friends to people and they are loyal
mm well that's compared to some other animals like cats
um they're really much more fun because they are not so independent
um
yeah maybe maybe the fact that they protect their home as well yeah
um what it has to do with with my role in the project is hard to say
uh i hope to be loyal to the project and not to n not to um let people doing similar projects know the details of our project or something
yeah
and where where are you from
i'm from estonia uh yep
estonia
um so is there anything else you'd like to know
oh right my roles um so um in the different um stages of the design
so at first i will be responsible for um for yeah designing the technical functions of the um
um of the remote control uh then in the in the conceptual design stage i need to um come up with uh interface concept and then in the last um stage i will be responsible for the int infa for the user interface design
okay that's it
thank you
okay um i'll do some
i'll rub the features and let the drawing stay
'kay um my name is gaurav
um my favourite animal one of my favourite animals is a cow
i've got no idea how to draw a cow
good luck
uh this is going to be
they're not just like a big round body and then some really skinny legs and then just some horns
yeah that'll do
okay so let let me draw the body first
mm
big round body really skinny legs and they've got a long tail and a long face
it's eating
it looks like eeyore
and there is some grass there
yeah
so this is what i like about cows that they just keeps sitting there eating grass they do not disturb anybody um they're kind of buddhist in a way
horns draw some horns
so yeah i like cows
um my my role in the project is um uh the industrial designer
so i'm supposed to design all the details of of the product um ho how it works and whatever it'll mm take during the functional role
what are the various functions that have to be performed by it uh during the um conceptual design
what are the various components of it and um finally i'm not too sure what was the last part
um the detailed design i i guess it will again be the identification of the components and how they integrate with each other
um i'm from india
uh i'm doing my p. h. d. in psycholinguistics i sit at the department of psychology
yeah
excellent
thanks
thank you
right now now it's my turn obviously
okay here's a space
that doesn't look like a cow does it
it looks very very cute
yeah i like the cow
i'm jen
yeah
mm-hmm
um i like dogs too but i can't do that already because i can't draw a dog as well as you can
i like
mm
is that a lizard
no way
hmm
wow
it's a gecko
ah a gecko okay
ah okay
yeah
is there a difference
is a ar are they also like lizards or are they yeah they are mm-hmm
they're
yeah they're l it's a kind of lizard
and i i like geckos because they remind me of warm places and
ah
uh-huh
and where i was living in cambodia they used to live in my house and they were on the ceiling and they would make little gecko noises in the evening
mm-hmm
i hope you don't like snakes do you
i don't like snakes
i come from australia and we have nasty snakes
okay
mm-hmm
that's where i'm from australia
i'm from melbourne and i'm your project manager for today and my role is basically to keep things going and make sure that you all work together
mm
in a productive way so that by the end of the day we come up with a great product
wonderful
okay
thank you
so let's see what's next in the powerpoint presentation
so i've just thought yeah i've just thought about this that we could even put it much more professionally as there we go
if you right click on it you can
mm-hmm
okay so this is the um overall budget for our
project
we've got um we're planning to sell these remote controls for let's make that go away that means we've got five minutes
um we're planning to sell the remote controls for twenty five euros each
um and with that we're aiming for a profit of fifty million euros
and that's selling them on the international market not just in the u. k.
um so to do that our finance people estimate that we need production costs of maximum twelve and a half euro so that we can reach that
profit target
so that's something to keep in mind while you're designing
okay
hmm
this is let me just skip ahead to see that's the last thing okay
we've only got a couple of minutes
does anyone have any first ideas to bounce around about um what we're thinking of this remote control
yep
i'm just wondering whether whether there is like any special feature that we want to have w want this remote control have as opposed to the already existing ones
mm-hmm
i think that's probably something that w it's best if we take away with us
but if we all have a think when we go away from the meeting
mm-hmm
what specific things could be um included in this remote control that that are out of the ordinary
i think uh i in the beginning uh one thing was that was mentioned was that it should be mm trendy
user friendly and original so um i think your point is relevant as far as the originality is concerned
that we should provide some features that are quite unique to this
something something new
yeah i was looking at the website
mm
and the other things that they've made and i like put down some like inspirational words like that i got from looking at the pictures
mm-hmm
so the motto is um we put the fashion in electronics and um so it's something that is sleek and stylish but it's still functional you know
mm-hmm
so i'm kind of thinking you know like those phones that they have
the new generation ones where they don't actually have any buttons on them and stuff like that
uh-huh
alright
you know so something heading towards that
so it's not overly i mean i don't know what h most of the buttons do on my remote controls
so i figure how many do you need you know
mm-hmm
mm
okay
so perhaps some sort of menu based thing or
something that's a little less crowded than this like i mean you know theoretically you can do all kinds of things with your t. v. right
mm-hmm
yeah
but what do most people do
they turn it on they watch certain specified channels you know and then they turn it off again
yeah
yeah
there is a lot of functionality in there that is not used ninety percent of the time but will be used ten percent of the time yeah
sometimes they play a movie
yeah so
yeah
there's no need to have buttons on it to do that maybe to do
so no
yep
it could be one button for a menu or something if you really need to go and do that
yeah
mm-hmm
and then use the
so if you're the kind of sad case that knows how your remote control works
then you know that's fine and you can do it on the screen rather than everybody else having to have those buttons which just confuse them
mm
mm-hmm
hmm
excellent
'cause like if you look at the train it's just very like there's no extra bits on it
the train on the website and i dunno if you can put it up on the thing um but it is just like a long like thing used for mu moving people
oh i haven't had a look yet yep
but it looks really pretty too
mm-hmm
great
any other immediate thoughts before we
mm
move along
uh we can aim for i mean we can think about all these little things but we can aim for something wi that gives a high battery life
although i don't think that um it's a huge problem for remote controls anyway battery life uh every now and then you need to replace the batteries
mm-hmm
yeah
um
yeah but uh i mean e even though it has to be re original we shouldn't uh go like too far away from from the usual ones
hmm
because otherwise the new users will just have a lot of problems with l learning yeah yeah
yeah
a big learning curve yeah
mm-hmm
yeah
so i it should kind of fit in as well and the stereotype of a yeah
it's like those fancy websites
hm hmm
that you can't access because you have no idea how to get in but the designers thought they were great
okay so we need to wrap it up now so that we can go away and get on with some of this
um we've got another meeting in thirty minutes so
you're you'll be getting specific instructions once you go back to your workspace but im basically you're looking at the working design
alright
you're looking at the technical functions design
and for you it's the user requirements specification like you said at the start
mm-hmm
okay
okay
thanks for that
thank you
uh i'll see you in half an hour
see you
carry the laptops back again
hmm
do we need to unplug things
probably
all hooked up
okay so now we are here at the functional design meeting
um hopefully this meeting i'll be doing a little bit less talking than i did last time 'cause this is when you get to show us what you've been doing individually
the agenda for the meeting i put it in the sh shared documents folder
i don't know if that meant that you could see it or not
did anyone
no
mm
no
oh well
um i'll try and do that for the next meeting as well so if you check in there there's a shared project documents folder
um and it should be in there
mm
um um wi on on a what
oh project project documents yeah yeah yeah okay
project documents yeah
so i'll put it in there
oh okay yeah
is it best if i send you an email maybe to let you know it's there
yes i think so
yep
i'll do that next time
um i'll act as secretary for this meeting and just take minutes as we go through and then i'll send them to you after the meeting
the main the main focus of this meeting is your presentations that you've been preparing during the time so we'll go through each of you one by one
um then we need to briefly discuss the new project requirements that were sent to us
i just sent at the last minute i'm sorry about that but we can see how that affects what you were you were doing
yeah the last minute yeah yeah
yeah
um and then we need to
by the end of the meeting come to some kind of decision on who our target group's going to be and what the functions of the remote control that's the the main goal is to come up with those two things
target group and functions of the remote control
and we've got forty minutes to do that in
so
i would
you said uh targ target groups what does that mean
say yeah
um
as uh who it is that we're going to be trying to sell this thing to yeah
uh okay 'kay
so are
so we need to yeah
we need to have a fairly defined group that that we want to focus on and then look at the functions um of the dem remote control itself
okay
so with that i think it's best if i hand over to you
does anyone have a preference for going first
alright
i can go first yeah
you wanna go first
okay
okay so we need to unplug my laptop and plug in yours
hmm
i assume we just pull it out
mm
right
um so f from the
just before you start to make it easier would you three mind emailing me your presentations
once we you don't have to do it now but when once you go back just so that i don't have to scribble everything down
okay yeah afterwards yeah okay
right sure
uh okay
so n uh with uh with regard to the uh working design of this uh uh remote control uh i've identified um a few basic uh components of the remote and uh se uh from the design
functional design perspective um w i c we can now uh know wha what exactly the components are and how how they work together with each other
so
this is the method that uh i'll mostly be following in my um in my uh role
um the identification of the components uh and uh since since i'm dealing only with the technical aspects
i would need feedback from the marketing person uh and uh from the user interface person
hmm
uh we'll then integrate this into the product design at a technical level and uh basically update and come up with a new design so it's a cyclical process
okay so these were the basic findings from today
the last three bullets have been integrated from uh the last minute uh email
uh i just quickly jotted them down
um so basically uh the as i told you the identification of how the remote control works and what are the various parts to it
uh and what are the different processes um and how the parts uh communicate with each other
um okay so e the mee email said that teletext is now outdated so we need to do away with that functionality of the remote control
um also uh the remote control should be used only for television because incorporating other features um makes it more comp complex
and the reason why teletext is outdated because uh of internet and uh the availability of internet over television
how however our our remote control would only be dealing uh with the the use for television in order to keep things simple
um also the management wants that um our design should be unique uh it so it should incorporate um colour and the slogan uh that our company um has it as its standard
okay so he he here is a functional overview of the remote control
um there's basically an energy source at the heart uh which feeds into the chip and the user interface
the user interf interface communicates with the chip so i'll basic go over to the
okay
so if uh if this is our energy source and this is a cell uh it communicates uh it feeds energy into the
into the chip which basically finds out h uh how how to do everything
there is a user interface here
so whe when the user presses a button it feeds into the chip and the chip then generates a response and takes the response to an infrared terminal
um which then so the output of the chip is an infrared bit code
which is then communicated to the remote site which h has an infrared receiver
um the there can be uh a bulb here or something to indicate whether the remote is on or communicating
um so these are the essent so a all the functionality of the remote control
whatever new functions that we need to do um make the chip more complicated uh and bigger basically
mm-hmm
okay
um so i in my personal preferences um i'm hoping that we can ke keep the design as simple and clear as possible
this would uh help us uh to upgrade our technology at a future point of time
and uh also if we can incorporate uh the latest features in our chip design
so that our um uh remote control does not become outdated soon and it's compatible with mot most uh televisions
that's about it
thanks
so anything that you would like to know or
okay
do you have any um i idea about costs at this point
no i don't have any idea about what each component costs
br
um yeah
okay
anything else
'cause that's something to consider i guess if we're if we're using more advanced technology it might
yeah
certainly yeah
so so tha yeah we definitely need to operate within our constraints
increase the price
yeah
but um unfortunately i i do not have any data so uh i just identified the functional components for that
that's fine
are there any more
questions or shall we just skip straight to the next one and then we can discuss all of them together at the end
i think we need like some general discussion at the end probably
yeah i think that will do
yeah okay
yeah
okay so do you want to
yeah i think since since we were discussing some um design issues then i i i would like to continue okay yeah
yes shall shall we pull this up
i think that has to come out of there
yeah
mm 'kay
yeah
thanks
yeah i thought those last minute things they're gonna hit you the worst
oh i
okay i hope wait
should it just
i it'll take some time
it ta takes a little
there's just nothing
oh and have you you need to then also press on yours function f. eight so the blue function key at the bottom and f. eight
oh right right right um
okay
nothin okay something is coming up
oh there it is yeah
now it's coming computer no signal
it'll come up it um uh no signal
no signal
why
maybe again
yeah yeah it says something now adjusting
oh
my my computer went blank now
okay adjusting
adjusting
but i don't see anything i don't see anything on my computer now
there we go there we go
okay
this is the problem but
oh that's strange
oh if you press if you press function and that again there's there's usually three modes
one where it's only here one where it's only there and one where it's both
okay
um
and one more time
okay so one more time
uh now it's okay
no
no
should yeah just wait for a moment adjusting
mm
oh okay
okay
okay that's fine that's good
okay let's start from the beginning
so i'm going to speak about technical functions design uh just like some some first issues that came up
um 'kay so the method i was um adopting at this point
it's not um for the for the whole um period of the um all the project but it's just at th at this very moment
mm-hmm
um uh my method was um to look at um other um remote controls
uh so mostly just by searching on the web and to see what um functionality they used
and then um after having got this inspiration and having compared what i found on the web um just to think about what the de what the user really needs and what um what the user might desire as additional uh functionalities
and yeah and then just to um put the main function of the remote control in in words
mm-hmm
um so the findings uh were um that the main function of the remote control is is just sending messages to the television set so this quite straightforward
and uh w some of the main functions would be switching on switching off
uh then the user would like to switch the channel um for example just m changing to the next channel to to flip through all all of the possible channels
or then mm uh the other possibility would be that um she might just want to choose one particular channel so we would need the numbers
and and also the volume is very important
um um i als okay
sorry cou could you go back for a second
uh switching on off channel uh volume okay that's great
'kay
um um among the findings i found that m m most of the curr mm presently available remote controls also include other mm functionalities um in their design
like operating a v. c. r. but they don't seem to be able to deal with d. v. d. players
but then there are surely there are many other functionali functions that could possibly be added to them
but according to the last minute update um actually um we do not want to have all this complicated functions added to our design
mm-hmm
so my personal preferences would be uh to keep the mm the whole remote control small um just like the physical size
and then it must be easy to use
so it must follow some conventions um like whereabouts you find the on off button and maybe the colour tends to be red or something
um then yeah
the must have buttons would be on off and then the channel numbers and then um the one that allows us to go to the next or the previous channel
and then volume has to be there
but then um other functionalities um could be just uh there could be a menu button and you could change things on the screen then
um for example brightness and mm similar functions could be just um done through the menu
and yeah the last question i had about whether we wanted to incorporate n uh more functionalities the answer was already no because of the last minute update
mm-hmm
so at the for the time being that's uh that's all
if you have questions
yeah
if i mean that was the the directive that came through from management
but if we had a a decent case for that we really think it's important to include video and d. v. d. i could get back to them and see
it's w it's just whether it's worth arguing about
yeah and also it's it's um other question is uh because there are so many different
and there are so many different things that could possibly be included because besides video and d. v. d. there are the mm um video c. d. s and whatever
mm-hmm
so it might be problematic to to choose between all these possible things
yeah
mm-hmm
okay
are there any questions for clarification of maarika before we go on to the next one
so in the u user interface requirements uh uh uh we we have been able to identify what are the basic buttons that we do want
um but um so so at this stage
uh how we go about implementing those button we will not identify or i mean in we can completely do away with buttons and uh have some kind of a fancy user interface or something like that
but uh is is there any uh uh any thoughts on that
um well i think the buttons are still mm kind of the most um easy for the user to use
i mean um what other options would you have
right
a little screen or something
but this would be really kind of i think a lot of learning for the user and and i mean the user just wants to get um get a result um quickly
yeah and it'll make the costs yeah
not to spend time in like um giving several orders um i dunno
right
mm-hmm
i think i th i would i would think the put the buttons but if if you have other mm proposals um
uh i think the co costs will also play a big role when we come to know about them
mm
so well we can probably wait until t we have more knowledge on that
yeah
mm
yeah
uh i if the if the costs allow we can have like an l. c. d. display and uh with um because we do want something fancy and fashionable as well
mm-hmm
so yeah
mm-hmm
yep
cool
sure we can discuss that maybe after the next one
cool
do you want to yeah
do you wanna give me the little cable thing
uh am i going in the right direction
yeah
no
wait
okay here it comes
oh i'm getting hungry
okay here you are
cool
ah that's why it won't meet
okay cool
you set
yep cool
okay functional requirements
uh we need to do the function key thing so that it comes up on here
alright yeah
hello
try to press oh okay yep
is it plugged in prop it's working
it's working
okay
excellent
cool okay
so
what i have
wh where i've got my information from is a survey where the usability lab um observed remote control use with um a hundred subjects and then they gave them a questionnaire
um so it was all about you know how people feel about the look and feel of the remote control you know
what's the most annoying things about remote controls and um the possibility of speech recognition and l. c. d. screens in remote control
not that they actually gave me any answers on the l. c. d. screens so i should have taken that bit out but anyway
um okay so
what they found is that people don't like how current remote controls are so you know definitely you should be looking at something quite different
um seventy five percent of users find most remote controls ugly
uh the other twenty five percent have no fashion sense
uh eighty percent of users would spend more to get um you know a nice looking remote control
um current remote controls they don't match the user behaviour well as you'll see on the next slide
um i dunno what zapping is but
it's um switching between channels sort of randomly going through
oh right
but you have that little thing that comes up at the bottom and tells you what's on
um okay fifty percent of users say they only use ten percent of the buttons so that's going back to what you know
mm
we were saying earlier about you know do you need all the buttons on the remote control they just make it look ugly
right
mm
okay
cool
um so this is my little graph thing
ooh that's a bit difficult to see
mm k
if you explain it to us it'll be fine
okay well i can send it to all of you
yeah
what it is is um it's cones 'cause i thought they'd be more exciting
um but ooh where's it go
i liked the i liked the litt ooh come back
back
oh
no
oh yes cool
okay i'm gonna stop playing with the little pointy thing
mm-hmm
um okay
so like what it shows is how much things are used relatively and what you can clearly see from that is the thing that's used most is the channel selection
okay
what you can't see is volume selection it's a little bit higher than all the others
mm-hmm that's the next one along yeah
yeah so what the graph shows is that you know power channel selection and volume selection are important and the rest of them
you know nobody really uses and so that's the the numbers along the top represent their like um their importance
mm-hmm
you know so on a scale of one to ten how important is that and
mm-hmm
you know channel selection and volume selection are absolutely essential and the power
well it's not quite so essential apparently although i don't understand how it couldn't be um and everything else
i think you know you can forget about having those buttons on the remote control 'cause they're just not needed and they're not used
mm-hmm
okay
this is the bit that the email messed up for me and that's what i was fiddling about with at the beginning of the thing
okay cool
so um okay so this is what people find annoying about remote controls
uh that they get lost that the uh you know they're not intuitive and that they're bad for repetitive strain injury
mm-hmm
i think if you're watching enough t. v. to get repetitive strain injury from um you know
the remote control
watching t. v. then that's the least of your problems but you know it's up there
mm
um that yeah
okay so um i mean the the r. s. i. thing would be that
like when you have the computer keyboards and you keep your wrists up would be something that encourages you want something with an ergonomic t design that encourages good use of the remote control and you know
right
mm-hmm
mm-hmm
not straining your wrists watching t. v.
yes
hmm
okay cool
right um sorry this is pink because i was copying and pasting the table and i didn't have time to white it out again
that's alright
um okay but that shows how people whether they would pay more for voice recognition software
so you can see from that that you know
younger people to the age of thirty five are quite likely to pay quite a lot more f well quite are quite likely to pay more for voice recognition software
whereas as people get older they're a bit more sceptical about it and they're less willing to to try it
um so clearly voice recognition is something to think about
but um you know i d i do wonder how well that would work given that a t. v. you know
tends to be people talking and um you know how are you going to stop it from just flipping channels whilst watching t. v.
mm
right
um okay
cool
um okay so these are my personal preferences
so you have sleek stylish sophisticated you know so something that's you know a bit cool
um you know functional so it's useful but minimalist
um there's a there's an important thing that you know people use when you know when you're filling up your home you know
a lot of people fill up their home with bits of crap basically you know
and you've got all this stuff and you're just like what the hell is that who is ever gonna use it
you know so things should either be functional or beautiful or preferably both so i think we need to aim for both
mm
mm
um okay then a long battery life like you were talking about earlier and um
you know i was thinking that solar power would be quite cool because
you know your remote control just sits there and you could just sit it in the sunshine and save the environment a bit
um and then like a locator so you know kind of like you have for a mobile phone or not a mobile phone
mm
some kind of a ring some
keys and things like that yeah
yeah that's it you know
whistle and it screams at you yeah
i know it's weird
my flatmate and i were talking about this on the way into uni this morning and i was like i need to get one for everything
so yeah so maybe something where you clap and then it beeps something a kind of sound that you don't often hear on the t. v. you know
mm-hmm
right
'cause you don't want your remote control beeping every five minutes 'cause you you'd then deliberately lose it by throwing it out the window or something
so okay
hmm
cool
that's me
that's you excellent
okay that's great thanks
um that's very good very interesting
um
i'm just gonna tick yes
so we've got about ten fifteen minutes to discuss
mm
i think one of the very interesting things that came up in um uh ka kate cat cat's uh presentation was um uh this this issue of uh uh like voice recognition being more popular with uh younger people
cat's
ca
so if we need to have a target group um then uh i think as far as the m motto of our company is concerned
if we want to have something sleek and uh you know
good looking uh we are better off targeting a younger audience then um you know people who are comparatively elderly
um
mm-hmm
yeah i mean that's the thing is that it didn't say in the survey you know whether
right
you know these are the people that will pay more for a more stylish remote control but i'm assuming you know yes
right
bu but but the survey did say that f things like voice recognition are more popular with them so if you want to put in something stylish
yeah
mm-hmm
then uh th it'll certainly be more popular with this i ye with the younger people as compared to older people yeah
mm-hmm
yeah
then again i guess the th where it was most popular was the fifteen to twenty five bracket and the i don't know how often they're buying televisions
right and
right
well that's when you go to uni isn't it
mm
so you know
yeah but you don't have much money generally
yeah
yeah you share a television or something that yeah
i would've thought it's it's more that twenty five to thirty five
when people are really moving out and they've got their first job and they want their nice toys and
right
yeah
but uh still if if you can go back to that slide and uh how popular was it
o oh it's on sorry we unplugged it
oh i've unplugged it
do you want me to
oh oh okay
here let me
that's alright if you can just look it up on your computer wh uh um people between twenty five to thirty five
yeah
yeah
uh how popular was so it was sti still still quite popular amongst them
seventy six point three percent
it was seventy something yeah yeah
yeah
mm-hmm
so even they are seventy six percent is that high amount
yeah i kn i mean i know what you're saying about the fifteen to twenty five year olds
yeah
but i mean it has been proven that that people of that age group have a higher disposable income because they don't have like i mean
you know if you're at university you're paying your rent but you don't have a mortgage you don't have a life insurance policy you don't
yeah they've got no commitments and
alright
usually not a car and all of those things
normally have a car yeah so
kids
yeah
you're still learning to drive actually so that just costs more than a car but yeah
yeah
so you're more likely to b
yeah
um so i mean like it is an age group to target really i think
yeah and if we're if we're talking twenty five euros as a price that's not unaffordable even for young people
no i mean that's what that's like fifteen pounds
yeah
you know i think
yeah this this is not unaffordable but the problem is whether people need it whether they do have a t. v. to use its full
yeah
yeah i d i don't know many people without a t. v.
yeah
yeah
but do they
we didn't have a t. v. last year and everyone thought we were off our heads you know
but the t. v. s are often kind of someone's old t. v. that's blah blah and be a bit strange to have a fancy rome remote
common the students yeah yeah
the s the stu yeah and the remote control might not yeah it might not even function with the old t. v.
mm
bu but even even in the case of twenty five to thirty five it's quite popular right
yeah i d well we've we've got quite a d decent t. v.
mm
yeah we're still yeah
yeah
so mm uh are are are
or w maybe we can just kind of uh uh
yeah
i think i think the fact that you know ninety one point two percent of fifteen to twenty five year olds are saying yes
i would pay more for a voice recognition remote control does say quite a lot really
yeah
mm
you know so i mean that and the disposable income and i don't think it's something to ignore you know
yeah
yeah but at the same time i think maybe we can we can just decide to to have both of these groups as our target
yeah
because actually i mean they're all still re young people
is not a massive difference you know
yeah
yeah if we ta if we take fifteen to thirty five but that then does imply that we should try and incorporate voice recognition
no do totally
mm
yeah
is that gonna have a an implication for the technical specs
um i was having a a general outlook on um m most like sophisticated features
but voice recognition itself i'm not very sure about
because one of the p uh things that cat pointed out was uh uh how do we go about implementing it
mm-hmm
uh and uh
you do have it in your mobile phone though don't you
because you have like i mean every mobile phone now has like call this person and it calls them
yeah
yeah
but how frequently do we use it anyway and um uh h ho how good is it you know uh voice recognition softwares are still quite uh
yeah
yeah
i don't know
yeah
with um but with a t. v. remote it's gonna be quite limited if we're t saying the main things people want to do is on off channel five
an
yeah
yeah
yeah
right
louder tha that should be relatively simple
s so
right
okay
y you'd maybe need a code word
o
do you know what i mean
right
mm
so like when you say change except that's being said quite a lot on t. v. so maybe like you know remote
i mean how often do people say remote on t. v.
yeah
mm
although i only watch charmed so really i wouldn't know but like so you'd just say remote five you know remote ten remote one two nine
right
yeah
mm-hmm
okay so it seems like a feasible thing to implement uh for for a limited yeah
yeah
yeah but maybe if you wanna look into that just to just to check
um so if we go for the the fifteen to thirty five age group
yeah but uh um
and then of course we're going to get th anyone who's older than thirty five who wants to look young and hip and trendy and has the money
yeah yeah sure yeah yeah
then they'll they'll still go for the same advertising
yeah
i don't think there's a lot of uh voice recognition remote controls
yeah w well now the v the voice recognition if if it works wonderfully w we could possibly do away with all buttons
but i think this is not really the right moment yet
because people are just so used to buttons and um yeah it's it's kind of safer so we we need both
yeah i think we need both
mm
w
what uh
so the voice recognition would be just an extra it wouldn't really reduce the size of the remote
yeah
mm
mm
what wh uh what i was thinking is that there is this uh separation between what the channels are on t. v. and how they are numbered on the remote control
if we can do with away with that our product can be really popular uh in the sense that uh a person can say
i want to watch uh i. t. v. one instead of saying that i want to go onto channel number forty five
uh-huh
yeah that would be another way to do it
uh-huh
yeah so if uh if something like that can be incorporated some kind of
so that if that was in the the voice recognition that would be great
yeah but then the code word would be even more important because i mean sky advertise on every channel don't they you know
yeah
yeah
mm-hmm
so then it would be you'd be watching charmed and then the sky advert would come on and it would change to sky
watch sky and yeah
yeah yeah and that would be really annoying
alright
yeah that's
right
mm-hmm
but that's definitely a possibility
yeah but m but on the other hand
mm
remote control isn't as close to you you probably might just just uh speak into it and and the t. v. would be already further away
yeah
so it might not pick up the other things coming from there
yeah
do you not think that defeats the object of having voice recognition on a remote control though
so that you can yell at it yeah
yeah you know so you have to have the remote control
it's more like if you lost it and it's down the sofa sometime you can yell at it and it'll just change it
you can look for it later yeah
yeah
alright
yeah but then the remote control i think i mean um the idea is kind of it's it's not that it's sitting there on on top of the television
because then you could already yell at the television and you wouldn't you you wouldn't need the remote control
so the remote control is still something you keep n near yourself
yeah yeah i suppose nearer to you but a b like if you have surround sound then
mm yeah and it might become very difficult from a distance for the television to understand what you're saying because of the noise factor for the remote control being cl i mean it'll it'll mm
mm
yeah yeah yeah
yeah
no but i i i was just defending the the fact why why we want to keep the remote control close to us
yeah
a and uh not to yell at it from the distance
yeah
yeah
mm
yeah
so uh wh another thing uh that can be used is that uh there can be a beeper button on the t. v.
so you can go and press that button and um and the remote control
mm-hmm
wherever it is it'll beep so we we can probably come to know where it is
that's but then if you're buying the remote separately but y you could have something
okay
yeah
oh yeah yeah
but i if it was something that you could like stick onto the t. v. or something
right yeah yeah yeah
okay yeah mm-hmm
some like a two p if you bought it in a two part pack so one part attaches to the t. v.
yeah 'cause it's it's quite important that you don't lose the the bit to locate the remote control
the l
well that's right but it solves the problem of having different noises
alright yeah
yeah definitely yeah
yeah
okay i think we're gonna have to wrap this up um
but if we go away with that that kind of general
um specification in mind that we're looking at fifteen to thirty five year olds we want it to look simple
but still have the buttons so it's easy to use but only those key buttons the major buttons and then one sort of menu one
the major ones yeah
and then voice recognition included as an option um but that obviously needs a little bit more working out as to whether it's really feasible and some of those problems we were mentioning um
mm-hmm
right
okay
what we have to do now is to go back to our little places
complete our questionnaire and some sort of summarisation which y you'll get immediately by email
send me your presentations so that i can use them to make the minutes
and then we've got a lunch break and after lunch we go back to our own little stations and have thirty minutes more work
mm-hmm
um i'll put the minutes in that project documents folder but i'll send you an email when i do it so that you know
so where exactly is this i
it should be on your desktop so on the yeah
ah okay
yeah
yeah
so i'll put it i'll put them there as soon as i've written them
did you find it
it's just yeah yeah
yeah yeah in that one right yeah
yeah and email them round
oh so y you want our um powerpoint presentations in there hey
yeah that would be great
okay
oh so so we'll just put them i there we we yeah w we won't even okay
oh yeah put them in there
yeah then you don't have to email them
there you go
but is everyone's called functional requirements
no they're all called something slightly different
no
technical requirements and something something yeah
okay so that's good
yeah
that's me done
so if you put them in there we'll all be able to see them and refer to them if we need to
okay cool
um as to where we're going from here you're going to look at the components concept
right
yeah
whatever that means
yeah
yeah
i guess i'll find out
you'll be looking you'll be looking at the user interface concept
uh something conceptual yeah
on something conceptual and you're watching trends to see how we go and surely voice recognition'll fall off the map or something that um we'll keep keep our options op hmm
wha what was it again that i was supposed to look into
con components oh
components yeah
hmm
sorry but um the next meeting um are we going to have it um right after lunch or shall we prepare our
no we have we have after lunch we have thirty minutes to ourselves to prepare
to prepare okay yeah that's good
so that's fine w before lunch we just have to complete the questionnaire and some sort of summary
okay
okay
right on time
cool
okay so you can i guess we'll see you for lunch in a sec
okay see you
excellent
so um i sent you the agenda it was on the in the project documents
i don't know if you got a chance to just have a look at it
anyway it's the meeting's gonna follow more or less the same structure as last time
so we'll go round each of you in turn and you can give your presentations on what you've been up to
um and at the end of that we need to discuss what you've come up with so that we can make a decision on the key remote control concepts
so that's we need to know about the components' properties materials the user interface and any trends that the marketing expert has been watching
right
okay
um do you wanna start again
okay
let me we've got forty minutes
right s so i haven't made a powerpoint presentation yeah i i thought i'll use the whiteboard instead
you haven't made a powerpoint okay
mm-hmm
um mm okay
let's hope the pen holds out
so basically i'll start off by uh i thought i'll use the whiteboard because we have so many different options and what we can do is that we can start um uh rubbing off the options that we do not require and putting in the options that uh are m or highlighting or underlining them or something like that
mm-hmm
okay
so uh i'll start again with a brief introduction to connect that anyway brief introduction to the insides of a remote control and uh then we can probably uh discuss the various components
yeah
yeah
okay so w what you see here is so this is the outside of the remote right
mm-hmm
if you open it you have a circuit board here right and this is the chip that i was talking about last time
this basically sends information to a tr uh transistor here which then uh sends the information to an l. e. d. device here
mm-hmm
if you flip the printed circuit board and this is th the most important point here uh everything else is kind of
okay so if you flip the circuit board this is what it looks like
so you see for example a particular button attaches to a particular place on the p. c. b. and uh on pressing this button i a circuit completes
yeah
the information goes to the chip which is somewhere here and the chip that tra then translates the code into an infra infrared radiation
which goes goes out through there
so uh the important point that i read over the website was uh that the configurations of these printed circuit circuit boards uh are quite cheap to make
you can ge get them printed as you want to so w we can have a configuration um irrespective of the cost the way we want to have
mm-hmm
mm-hmm
right
so that's the important point here so these are the different options that we have
okay
so the batteries i'll start with the battery right
mm-hmm
so they can be simple which is like uh the normal batteries in uh our uh the cells yeah
yeah
uh thes these are the kind different kind of batteries that the company makes right
so
and dynamos
um yeah yeah
does that mean like a wind up one
a wind up remote
so uh i don't know if even if you want to consider this but these are the different things that the company makes
so th they'll they'll since uh they'll come internally from the company they'll be eas uh cheaper uh all these options
okay
mm-hmm
so the third one is uh the kinetic energy ones
you could make the hand dynamo into an exercise bike and then people could exercise whilst watching t. v.
yeah
and charging their remote yeah
yeah and stop worrying about the whole r. s. i. from the remote thing 'cause that's just
yeah it's a good option
so what was what was this k ka
the the kinetic energy one is uh that e uh uh they are usually modern watches since our hand keeps moving it keeps the watch ticking
okay
uh yeah
but i dunno i if it is a good idea for a remote control because it'll just lie there for a long while sometimes
mm-hmm
for a remote 'cause you
yeah
but as soon as you pick it up it moves and then again it uh re recharges or something
mm-hmm
yeah
and the fourth option is the solar cells which are also made by the company
yay
environment friendly
okay um so i'll list things and then we can come back and discuss what what we think from uh everybody's perspective
yeah
there are different cases that can be provided
they can be basically the shape of the cases they can be flat they can be curved with uh one sided
mm-hmm
curved and one side flat and they can be curved with on both the sides
mm-hmm
these are the three options right
um
um you mean this would be like the the overall shape of the remote control yeah mm-hmm
yeah would it be flat on both the sides would be curved from one side or whatever uh there were different kind of supplements available
yeah mm-hmm mm-hmm
mm-hmm mm-hmm
mm-hmm
um like it can be in plastic rubber wood or titanium right
mm-hmm
okay
did you say wool
wo wo wood
wood wood
wood
yeah
oh right
a fluffy remote
not wool
yeah you'll understand why when we get to my presenta
oh really
okay
huh
um the so uh we can use even um a certain titanium is also used uh in the company to make uh uh some space design equipment
so it's kind of um uh it'll be probably nicer to use because it relates to the overall image of the company
but uh it cannot be used on a double curved surface
if we choose this we cannot use titanium
mm
for for these two we can use titanium wood rubber or plastic
mm-hmm
yeah
uh okay the interface options now
so
we can have push buttons like most remotes do and our company is an expert in making push buttons
ooh
uh we can have scroll wheels like the ones on um uh mouse pointers uh uh
sony
mm-hmm
sony ericsson mobile phones has it
yeah yeah something like that
mm
so and they have they can even have an an integrated uh push button inside the scrolling thing
okay
the scroll plus push
so this is something that has been recently developed by the company um in the last decade so not too recent
and l. c. d. s we can have l. c. d. s
so these two are recent and and this is q quite old
mm-hmm
the various electronic options are um
uh so th this concerns firs first of all the the chips i i showed you at uh so there's there's a chip behind this one right
the p. c. b. is uh inexpensive so we can put put in uh whatever we want
but the various integrated circuit options are we have either a simple one
mm-hmm
or a regular
or advanced
and uh the price goes up
mm-hmm
as we go down obviously
um okay
so the good thing about uh wh wh why why we would want to use advanced u why we might want to use advanced is that l. c. d. s can only come with the advanced chip
mm-hmm
um the we need regular or advanced for uh scroll wheels
right
um and the chip basically includes the infra infrared sender
mm-hmm
yeah
uh besides this in electr under electronics uh also the company has started making a sample sender
which is did not explained what i what it was but i'm guessing that uh so they have a sample sender and a sample speaker
so i'm guessing that uh the sample speaker is probably something like um uh you know
as soon as you press a button it it mm uh give gives you feedback one five or whatever
yeah on
mm-hmm
um and uh i dunno whether sample sender sender has to do something with voice recognition or not but anyway
mm-hmm
so these are the different options that we have
okay so th that's that's basically now now uh i think that uh we can integrate um uh you know
uh the user interface uh and uh the marketing things in that keep uh taking out things from this and uh underlining things that are important yeah
yeah
mm-hmm
excellent
do you wanna stay somewhere near the board so that if we need to you can sit down but just we might need you to leap up
okay
yeah yeah sure
sure
yeah
okay
what are you powerpoint or
um i have some powerpoint yeah
right
okay
oh
do you think these pens can give you cancer of the hand
'kay
some sort of radiation
no it's got its little camera in there plug it in
yeah
okay
's a
yeah it should should do it
yeah
right interface concept
okay
um to be honest actually i mentioned some some of the things which which could fit on the on the this talk um this time
i m i mentioned them already in the previous talk
that's fine
so um yeah this time um i might not have them on the slides but i i can just mention them aw again
mm-hmm
okay
so um i thought um i would also include the definition of user interface um so it's the aspects of a of of a computer system or programme which can be seen uh by the user um and and which uh the mechanisms that the user uses to control its operation and input data
so this would p includes things like shape and size and buttons and um voice recognition as well and colour and so on
mm-hmm
um um the method i employed this time was a again having a look to related products and mainly on the internet and then um analyse them uh from the point of view of user fen friendliness and also um whether their appearance was was pleasant
um and then um this uh this um
this can help us to decide which features we want to incorporate in our product
mm-hmm
so some findings um um
so in in the case of many user interfaces
they're just so full of buttons that it's actually uh hard to find the ones you you really um want to use and um and it's just confusing
it takes y know time to learn
um okay and i thought i would just quickly show some of them that i found
okay some of them are here
um well the picture is not very clear but as you can see there are actu oi oh oh oh sorry for that
's go back
that's nice one
ah no please
okay so yeah they're quite big and have many many buttons
actually of the of all these i personally p prefer this one
because it's it's the smallest and and with with least uh with the smallest number of buttons as well
and i would say even the appearance of some of them is kind of not so nice
ugly
mm
um okay
so let's carry on with this
um
so uh um o other findings um some new things um used uh some of them were mentioned already by our technical um designer uh
our own company has developed a new in user interface uh wait no this is not the one
okay there is a we can uh include voice recognition and um it allows i it's possible to record eighty different voice samples on it
mm-hmm
mm
uh so uh this uh this one was already mentioned uh the l. c. display
it's yeah
um s another new development is a scroll button which was also th also already mentioned
and uh our own manufacturing division ha has uh designed a new um
uh programmable speech uh
mm sorry uh speaker unit i guess it's it should be
yeah
um and this means that um once uh uh it it it comes together with a voice recognition
but it's once once the mm um gadget uh recognises uh the voice of the speaker
there can be a um pre programmed answer for example
you can pick up the remote control and say something to it like hello and it says some hello and your name or whatever
uh-huh hi yeah
so i mean this is also one of the n dev new developments which we might consider if we wanted to include
mm
uh sorry uh can you go back for a second
um uh are you sure wha what this means a spinning wheel with the l. c. display
uh oh yeah are th
it's like the like you said no
the scroll scroll wheel
yeah you can't
no no the scroll button is a different thing
i i have a picture if you just a moment i'll i'll show you
i wasn't completely sure myself but i think it's just like um it's it's a wheel it's like not separate buttons
oh okay the ipod thing yeah
look this one here
oh it's like the ipod
but i'm i'm not really sure whether whether you can really turn it round it's like you press this or this or
g yeah no you can
uh it's the ipod uh kind of uh
it's like it's like where you you know how you have your your mouse
uh-huh
and y you go round and i it's kind of like that and you spin round and it yeah
alright right
okay okay
so instead of going down you just spin yeah yeah
it is
you just go round and it is a bit weird at first but it's actually very like fast
mm-hmm
uh-huh
mm-hmm
i like the the wheels that click on the side you you get 'em much slower so it's quite good if you like searching quite a lot of stuff
mm-hmm
right
uh-huh
do you know if you're lookin if you're th scrolling through the a. to z. of your music and you're looking for something at t.
mm-hmm
then it's a lot faster than the wheel but you've got a lot less control over it
mm-hmm
right
so maybe i should include that here as well l. c. d. s um plus spinning
mm
yeah
uh
yeah
okay and the personal preferences are pretty much the same as as as last time
mm-hmm
it it has to be small simple
okay we decided to include voice recognition so to have the standard uh major buttons like on
off um ch the channels and and then um volume and then the rest would be a menu on the screen
um and i i also thought uh if we want to keep it small and nice um and actually i i quite like the idea of a scroll a scrolling button
i thought it could be for for voice like i dunno it mm like on a um i like it used to be on walkmans or something
there is uh i think there is no reason why we couldn't use something like this for for the remote control
mm-hmm
mm-hmm
so yeah that's uh that's it
excellent
okay straight to trends and then we can discuss it all at once
right
okay i've put the copy of the presentation in um the yeah
the project documents
excellent
if you two could both do that as well in case we need to refer to it
mm-hmm
cool
here it comes
okay
fabulous
okay cool
um so what i did was to search the internet to come up with market trends and you know what users are gonna be wanting in the the near future
mm-hmm
okay
right
now the first aspect is apparently twice as important as the second aspect which is twice as important as the third a aspect
okay
so i mean the the easy to use thing is fairly low down on the which i think given the target group is what you would expect really
mm-hmm
mm-hmm
um you know people want something new something technologically innovative and different
so the whole idea with the l. c. d. s and the spinning and the colours and the voice recognition is quite like quite the thing to go for
mm-hmm
okay
and um yeah it wants to look fancy fancy look and feel
so um uh maybe uh as you're discussing things is it okay if we just uh keep highlighting things here
so
yeah yeah sure
yeah yeah
yeah
right
so mm uh so it yeah so probably voice recognition is is kind of important right
that's over on the interface if if you could put
yeah
um and an yeah
and maybe the l. c. d. and spinning so that means we need an advanced thing
okay i i have a point about l. c. d. i dunno if it is the right point to take it up
w uh l. c. d. s are basically for feedback right to the user who's pressing buttons
mm-hmm
mm
and the feedback can come through television itself so do we need an l. c. d. on the remote
depends how fast your television runs really don't don't you think
i mean we've got one of those um telewest boxes and you put the number in the remote and then you wait and then it goes to the t. v. and then you wait
mm
and then it comes so i it actually takes quite a long time
mm
and if you get the number in wrong then it's a bit of a pain so i think
right
you know a screen on the remote would probably cut down your time on that
but like remotes do tend to get f thrown about a bit
right
it it is also quite nice though to to have something here so you don't interrupt the picture on the screen so if you're watching something
you know
yeah
that's true yeah that's also
and i it would be like i mean if you could make it integrate with the t. v. then it could come up with new information about what's on
and you could just see that on the remote rather than
yeah
rather than having to interrupt your viewing pleasure
yeah
but um i think maybe a way to do it would be a similar way to how you have your mobile phone you know
right
like you have the slidey ones and you have the flippy ones and then the screen's protected so it doesn't actually get scratched
mm
mm-hmm
so you can have like what looks like a normal remote control you know or like a minimalist remote control
yeah
so you got your buttons one to nine your on and off and your volume on that and then if you want to mess about with it
mm right
and then you can flip it open
you flip it open and yeah
okay
so now we seem to have a consensus that l. c. d. s are definitely the way to go because of style and
yeah i think so
yeah so that kind of decides your whole chip thing
right
yeah
you you agree
maarika yeah
yep yeah
yeah
right
so l. c. d. s yeah definitely
okay
go on
cool
okay apparently fruit and vegetables will be providing inspiration
sorry i discovered clip art
um so these will be an important feature for clothes shoes and furniture
so i mean i'm taking this to mean you know curviness
do you know
'cause you don't tend to get flat vegetables
yeah and possibly even uneven like not not symmet yeah
mm-hmm
you know
yeah bit of asymmetry and stuff
but that would be a good way to to get in the whole um r. s. i. issue in there
mm-hmm
because i mean if you think most people use the remote control with their right hand ha right hands so you wanna you curve it so that it's suitable for use with the right hand
right
mm-hmm
mm
mm-hmm
um yeah i'm not quite sure about the relevance of material will be spongy
um
something a bit squishy and
yeah but i mean y you have to
yeah we we have we have rubber but there is a problem that i forgot to discuss with the um with using
so it could be like a rubbery yeah uh-huh
well i suppose you wouldn't get a remote uh an electric shock off your remote control if it was made of rubber
yeah and it'd help if you drop it it protects it as well
yeah yeah
to some degree
so if if we use uh latex cases they won't allow us to use solar cells as an energy source that is the constraint
uh-huh
so um we could use titanium wood or plastic uh or uh
or if we want to use the the latex then we have to go with one of the other um power things
if it's made of rubber you could get the kinetic energy fairly easily there you could just bounce it up and down
yeah w energy source
from from bouncing it
yeah tap it on the desk yeah
you can have it as like a little ball to bounce that flips open
yeah
um so yeah um okay
mm
so probably double curved surface is the way to go yeah
yeah yeah
mm yeah
or or curved at one end and flat on the top because i i'm not sure if it is flat on both both the sides
then ho how much easy would it be to reach for buttons etcetera
um
you have to have a certain element of flatness i think
yeah
it it depends on the whole ergonomics of it you know it's like how you put your hands so y it's the least movement basically
yeah
yeah singe single side curved or double side curved does not say too much does it
uh-huh
it uh
no i d i don't think it makes a lot of difference
i i have one of those s slidey phones and i mean the back is essentially straight but it's curvy so
mm
mm
uh i think uh
besides you have four sides to a thing so i mean does curved one side mean one side is straight and
yeah 'cause the
yeah
right
you know curved two sides means the whole thing is just a big curvy p thing
right
dunno
di now did it say anywhere in your research material about this sliding stuff uh because um according to the information that i have
i think uh the onl only options that we have with the case is are these three
yeah
uh eith either we have uh a flat surfaced uh case or a curved surfaced case
it does not say anything about uh whether technically you know this this stuff is available at all
nothing to open them
yeah
uh it's it's more about the protecting the l. c. d. which i think is where it came from
right yeah yeah
but no my research didn't tell me anything which is why we have all the pictures 'cause i had nothing better to do with my time
right
okay
okay cool
anything else
what've we got
uh combine style with a level of functionality um beauty and practicality and a thing of beauty and p function
okay so
cool thanks
okay
thanks
looking at what we've got we we want an l. c. d. display with a spinning wheel
yeah
let's let's try to r rub off things and yeah so um hand dynamos are definitely out right
yeah rub off some of those
yeah it's not that's not streamlined and sexy having a having a wind up
you you got a wind dynamo yeah
yeah uh hum yeah
okay
um kinetic energy does seem to have some kind of uh uh appeal but uh
i think tha
it's about the practicality of it really isn't it
it's
yeah
you know
as against a watch which constantly keeps moving this this thing will have to be tapped every time which which might be very frustrating for the user
i mean if
depends how much how much movement it really needs
kinetic energy it needs i don't have too much technical information on that yeah right
pr presumably if they're suggesting it then we could use it
okay let's keep it option uh keep an option yeah
i'd i'd keep it on
um the flat co completely flat case is definitely out right
yeah it's yeah
we don't want that it's no it's not not vegetable
it has to be at least curved from one side yeah
um okay we still have all all the options
wood do you think wood will be a good idea
n wood is i can't n how do you uh i mean you can't keep it really small uh you can't make it like thin and
mm
right
the wood thing
mm
i can't imagine a m wooden remote control
because you need to you n you need to put all the technology in
so i mean if the case you add the case and it it becomes a bit bulky wi mm mm yeah
yeah if if it is really thin if it is really thin it it's likely to break it's it's much more uh
mm
yeah yeah
yeah and given that we're we're looking at more spongy material preferences i ha would think maybe rubber or plastic is more
yeah
u yeah wood is not really yeah
right
well it's not very cleanable either do you know
yeah
that's true
yeah
it's it's not a practical i mean it's it's alright for a table but for a remote control you know
yeah
and splinters and stuff and
yeah okay wood is out
yeah
it just m doesn't make any sense i think is the thing with wood
right
yeah yeah in the case of remote control not really
yeah
okay now for the really interesting stuff the interface
yeah
right so uh the the push buttons is is our expertise uh in the industry
but uh it seems to be out of trend you know nobody seems to be
you have to have some push buttons don't you
yeah but you um i think for for the channel numb uh channel numbers you still need them wouldn't you
mm-hmm
g yeah yeah
mm right
yeah so for channel numbers but
oh if if we have l. c. d. displays that opens up a whole world you know
if you have an l. c. d. display then mm you can select almost everything on the l. c. d. display
but i th yeah but i think the l. c. d. display is kind of yeah
just for fast
it's faster with a m yeah and w if we dis and when we s um discussed that we might like this flipping open thing
then i mean y you can use it as a normal remote control but if you do want to use l. c. d.
right
yeah
okay
yeah
then you flip it open but it's it it's more time consuming
yeah
yeah
i think this is going back to the the graph at the beginning that i made where you know the buttons that people use all the time
you want buttons for them and everything else menu driven
mm right
yeah
and it yeah l. l. c. d.
so uh in in the buttons we have for the channels also we have options
do you do we enumerate everything from zero to nine
or do we have just uh channel plus channel minus just to just to scroll
no no i mean mm we we definitely need the the numbers because it's uh otherwise people don't want to flip through all the channels
the numbers
yeah
yeah
do we need them on as buttons or do we need them as l. c. d.
right
um
or on the l. c. d. we can you know
g yeah i would think buttons yeah
yeah i would say buttons because it's yeah
buttons
okay
it's it's the i think the thing is so if someone just wants to turn on their t. v. and put on a channel
i
so mm
mm
then it should be easier to use than any other remote and then if someone wants to you know
yeah
yeah
change the contrast on their t. v. and they should be able to do that and it should be accessible but you know
alright
mm-hmm
i mean most of the time i mean there's a limit to how much the biggest techno geek can spend fiddling with the t. v.
yeah
right
i think is the the the issue there
okay so buttons definitely in but oh shall we uh try to draw a prec um
i think that's what you guys are gonna do next so if we put down the key um things that we want
uh okay
okay okay so the components
yeah
right so uh what about the the scrolling uh
yeah but n i i'm not completely um completely clear uh i yeah about the spinning wheel
so i think it it doesn't make sense to have both like a scrolling and spinning thing
e either or
it's uh you can al include everything in the spinning if you yeah yeah in that case
just spinning and not scrolling i would say
g yeah
i would say the s the s the spinning goes at a high speed to th to the scrolling wheel
yeah
so you have to decide whether you you know you want to be going so fast or not
but i mean the the thing with this whole if y you're planning on making it out of rubber
on the basis that it's spongy then i'm not sure how well a scrolling wheel would work
hmm
mm um
but if you've got a if if you've got a flipped thing
ah but i mean you can
effectively it's something that's curved on one side and flat on the other side but you folded it in half
yeah but y your spinning wheel tends to go to one side
th that would be on one side uh-huh
i'm not sure it'll be a good idea to construct the whole thing out of rubber
yeah i um i think so too i mean the case would be yeah the case would be rubber and the the buttons
uh i it
no i think it's just the casing rubber on the outside
you want an outside of rubber and then open it up and
or or at the corners edges just the edges covered by rubber or something like that
yeah
rubber buttons but then
yeah
everything else in plastic or even titanium if we want to use it
yeah
or maybe like interchangeable cases
mm-hmm
'cause i know like we're going back to ipods again n the whole spinning wheel
but i have like a you know obviously my ipod's not made of rubber
but then i have a little rubber case that goes over the top of it and i can change the colour theoretically to match my outfit
right right
mm
right okay so so that gives us a more trendy look as well
um
yeah i think the spinning wheel is definitely very now
right
mm-hmm
yeah and uh we're going more for the trends than for the usability anyway right
mm-hmm
that's right that's what they're after
yeah
so
i'll rub that out
and uh colours can be provided with the case rather than
um but we still need to te think about the colour of our remote as such you know just keep it black or
mm-hmm
yeah i think we um it was a a requirement that we use our um th the colours of our company
so would it be like yellow grey and black or something or
i guess
that doesn't fit in with the whole vegetable theme though
yeah does
bananas
yeah
banana's yellow yeah definitely
yeah
but i mean do you think we could incorporate the colours of the company into the buttons and then make the colour of the main remote the colour like vegetable colours
do you know
so you could have like i mean i suppose vegetable colours would be orange and green and some reds and um maybe purple and that and then you'd pick the buttons in company colours to to match with it
mm-hmm
green
yeah
mm
okay
um okay if you g go over to uh the integrated circuits
uh since we're having l. c. d. s there there's no way that we're will be able to um what we do need to consider
we need the advanced yeah
however is that the price is going up for the ever every such thing that we are considering
yeah
but since l. c. d. s seems to be uh a definite yes so it seems to be one area where we would want to spend
yeah
so i'll rub off the other two
mm-hmm
so are we discounting solar energy because rubber's gonna be used in there somewhere or
that was the
oh is oh the constraint was uh yeah
if solar panels with the rubber
we can't have solar panels with rubber so
yeah
so
yeah okay so we lose that i think
shall we go for if we're going for rubber we think uh on as our case and then
mm-hmm
and the buttons as well i think
yeah
yeah
i think uh we'll have uh uh using the simple battery will be a safer option as compared to the kinetic energy one
we've got five more minutes
i mean a although it does seem uh interesting
mm-hmm
yeah
yeah
but it does not hold any advantages as such for a yeah
yeah mm-hmm
it's just a gimmick
okay
uh okay so r we understand this better now that uh the the speaker is for the feedback right
mm-hmm
it it says uh the things that you type in or something like that so
yeah
i think if we can if we can include them at not too much extra cost then i'd put them in but if it's
ye yeah we we don't have too much information about it um
yeah
yeah but it it i think it should be quite cheap because it's from our own company yeah
it's from the company so
yeah okay so so th this is in as well then the sample speaker
yeah
okay
right
and the case is curved on one side but then flat flat so it's flipped into each other
flat on the top
mm-hmm
yeah
okay
can i pull the thing out the back of your computer
yeah sure j
just so we can
sorry do you want me to
nothing it's right i'm just
there we go
what does um i. c. s. mean
i. c. s
uh integrated circuits
okay cool
so it's advanced integrated circuits
yeah
uh oh now i've gone too far
uh um we we're definitely going in for voice recognition as well as l. c. d. s mm
yeah
yeah
we're on our way
okay
so we've basically worked out that we're going with a simple battery
the advanced chip and a curved on one side case which is folded in on itself um made out of rubber and
right
yep
the buttons are also rubber
we're having push buttons on the outside and then on the inside an l. c. d. with spinning wheel and we're incorporating voice recognition
that's our overall concept and it's gonna look sort of vegetable and be in bright vegetable colours
um
uh-huh
so w w would with have the spinning wheel inside with the l. c. d. or would it be on the outer
i think it's on the
imagine it would be inside
okay
so um actually that could like really cut down your thing so you've got your outside which is like minimalist
mm
mm-hmm
and then you open it up and you've got a screen and a spinning wheel which you can incorporate buttons into
yeah okay
mm-hmm
mm mm
um so you've still not got like a lot of stuff in the
yeah
on the
you've maybe got you know like if you're modelling on ipod you've got five buttons and a wheel
mm-hmm
and four of the buttons are in the wheel and the other one's the little bit inside the wheel yeah
in the centre yeah sure
mm yeah
okay so now we've got thirty minutes before our next meeting
in the meantime the industrial designer over here is gonna work on the look and feel design which i'll presume he'll work out what that means
mm-hmm
um the user interface designer will work on the user interface design and the marketing expert is going to work on product evaluation
and as well as that
the two designers are going to work together on our prototype following those instructions that we've just come up with using modelling clay and you will get extra instructions from your personal coach
mm-hmm
cool
is that all okay
and anyone who hasn't put their their presentation in the project documents folder it would be good just so in case we have to refer to it
yeah
yeah okay
mm-hmm
cool i'm gonna go and sit on my own
y ah nobody wants to talk to you
i know i'm hated
unplug yourself
hmm
i've got a bit tangled up in all this
so but shall i move away first or shall i stay here with we need to
i dunno maybe i would car
i'm proud of it
okay
this is our final meeting the detailed design meeting
and again i'll take minutes
the what we have to get through in this meeting is firstly the prototype presentation from you two
so you can show us what you've been working on so diligently
yeah
um then
it does look very cool
then cat's going to present the evaluation criteria that we're going to be evaluating this against
then i need to say some st a few things about finance 'cause we have to check that it's within the finance criteria
um and then we'll be making sure that our product fits both the evaluation criteria from cat and the financial limits
um and then we uh will have a brief evaluation of the whole process of production and design that we've been through
so we've got forty minutes
and then do we get to make a remote control
s
'cause we missed out
yeah
so
it's now i guess that we're supposed to start at fifteen thirty five so we've got until four
fifteen
uh-huh
is that right
how how much do we have forty minutes
yeah about four fifteen yeah
yeah until about four fifteen
yeah
yeah
so yeah
okay so
go for it
do you want
so you said um are are we starting with the the so will you maybe start with like the mm the shape and things and and then i will explain the the user interface th uh things
yes
presentation
okay
like the buttons and the scrolling things and
okay
so um basically going with our trend of vegetables and we selected the colour and approximate shape of banana
you think bananas are a safe thing to use
um
it's a bit um phallic
yeah
well but it's it's just an a approximation
um
dual use perfect
yeah
dual use perfect
oh your remote control
oh that's just bad
does it vibrate when you press the buttons
um so basically it's the it's the flip open thing again
sorry sorry
mm-hmm
so now we we have the okay so ma maarika will explain you the user interface there
and it flips open on the side so it opens like that
mm-hmm
and we have the user interface o in here and uh the the l. c. d. and and the scroll are inside
wow
um
well everything else is probably user interface so
yeah yeah
uh yeah
and it's the whole thing's made of rubber is that
oh yeah
rubber
yeah it has yeah
yeah
is it to scale or do you think you can make it a bit smaller
um it could be made a bit smaller and and of course it would be and yeah
yeah
but um one thing we actually kind of um forgot while designing
that one side was supposed to be rounder so we said the back side round yeah
yeah well but i since it's made of rubber anyway
i i think it's it's uh
mm-hmm
yeah
it l does look like the curvy and then the whole shape's curvy so i would say that this curvy does look quite like a vegetable
yeah
yeah
yeah
mm
hmm
and it's spongy as well
i wasn't very keen on that but yeah
so so uh the user interface as as we discussed last time uh mm on on the on the cover we just have the very basic things
huh
mm-hmm
so we have that n uh channels here starting from um uh one two three there would be numbers in in the on the actual one
yeah
so it's four up to four up to seven up to nine and zero z zero here
six seven eight nine
i like that
yeah
and then well this is on off button
it's it's quite standard mm place for it and and also the colour is quite often red so it's it's kind of user friendly
yeah
and then these ones would be for flipping the channels back and like the previous one and the next one
uh-huh
and and we would also have a l little um thing saying here previous and ne prevon prevon next
so where's the volume
yeah
the volume is is scrolling
on the side this one
it's on the side
ah you did get that in then mm-hmm
yeah you just do it like this
and and and it's it's on the back is mm cover or back lid because if you flip it open you can still do the scrolling here
oh okay
mm-hmm
see
so the volume is you just scroll but then once you flip it open okay
there there you have the screen and and you have the mm spinning wheel with options to choose
yeah
mm-hmm
you can move back and forth and then if you need to m choose something on the screen you just push the cen mm the middle button
mm-hmm
cool
oh the thing we forgot was like a mute button
uh no we we'd not put so on on the cover we have the the bare essentials
a mute button
yeah
well we'll have this on the screen on the display
y or you could have it so you on the wheel if you
on the wheel like if you hold the wheel down then it will mute
uh on the l. c. d. we r you know the main menu will have various options
well but the but the mute yeah the scrolling is kind of you have to scroll all the way to make it mute right
but if you hold it in if it's a scroll and click so you hold it in
yeah but it's a scroll and click isn't it
mm
okay yeah okay
okay cool
so that that solves the whole mute issue
mm
yeah
and okay so i so the the voice recognition is also just part of it
you can't really see it in the interface
no
yeah it's hidden in there somewhere
yeah
and we do have the logo on it as well
mm-hmm very good
so i think it
and it's with the the black and yellow you're even in the right colours
yeah
yeah i think um we could do l the logo in grey as it is on the website
cool
mm-hmm
yeah
we ran out of resources here so
in the actual one
yeah
so if you have questions
you can have a look
very good let's have a look
test it out
uh it's a sort of intermediate colour i guess
yeah oh we hold the remote
oh but it it does feel all cold and slimy
i hate play do it's just minging
but yeah uh that's cool cool
very good
mm-hmm
okay so maybe if we go on to evaluation cri criteria and then we'll there i suspect we're gonna have a couple of minor finance issues
okay
yeah see the budget
but um we'll se i'm sure we can get around them somehow
we'll just send all of our manufacturing to
some nice poor country and
cut some of the prices that way
wales
wales for example
mm
cool okay
right okay
fabulous yeah
marketing expert
okay cool
so what we're gonna do is prefer prepare the evaluation of the new design
mm-hmm
um so we're gonna be using a seven point scale so one is you know yes
it totally meets with that requirement and seven is no it really doesn't we need to go back and start again
um you know
basically what i did was i went through all the like user requirements and things that we've done and we've worked on and like made a list of them
um you know so that we can evaluate each one and like so it was about going back to the start and saying oh yeah
we did manage to do that or oh no we really forgot about that
yeah
mm-hmm
okay
cool so these are what they are
oh
so for each of these we need to give it a one to seven
is that right
yes i did have a. b. c. and d. down here but it seems to have turned into like just bullet points
mm dots never mind
okay
but if you can imagine that they say a. b. c. and d. then that would be really good
i guess we'll give it maximum points in everything
yeah the yeah it's definitely attractive
yeah i agree
oh the locatable thing we actually forgot
well i thought we'd um kinda said that you'd have a little thing to stick on the t. v.
yeah
yeah just prepare one now
shall i just prepare it now
yeah
it will be red too
cool
okay
so be attractive to look at
that's this one
what do you all say
s seven was th the maximum yeah
so
i reckon it
yeah
yeah
i i go for seven
seven yeah it's terribly sexy
oh we're all so proud of the
yes
yeah
okay so that'll be a seven for a.
could oh no you can't whilst that's up there
okay um uh what i've done on the next page is i've set it up so we just put the marks in
ah okay
okay
excellent
except we can't uh we can if we then yeah i'll take a note it's fine
yeah
but that's alright
but we can we can i can i can take note uh uh
if you take a note of them and then i'll put them in in a minute
okay so we're all agreeing on seven for a.
yeah
cool okay
does it match the operating behaviour of the user
i would think yes yeah
um the the only thing that we were considering was that uh this thing is kind of more for right handed people than for left handed people
i think it does
yeah
i mean
so if you're left handed you're kind of left uh scrolling with your finger
yeah so y so we we might do we might want to do like a uh another m model another another version
alright
which is like exactly the mirror image of this one
yeah
but that's gonna be a problem 'cause you don't always have all left handers or all right handers in a family
but then yeah
yeah
yeah
so bu it's it's not a huge problem because i i it is operatable
i th i think it's not it's not like it's a pen
but then then i think left handed people are already used to discrimination anyway so they just
yeah
yeah but i mean because it's not like it's a pen you know left handed people can't normally write right handed
yeah
but they can normally do most things right handed so i would say it's not such a big issue
yeah
right
yeah because i mean anyway right handed people would be able to scroll with it so i if the majority are right handed it's uh
mm-hmm
yeah
yeah
yeah
i mean you can you can use your finger to to scroll rather than your thumb
mm-hmm
yeah
yep
so i mean that does kind of negate the whole r. s. i. issue
mm
so maybe we need to put that needs a little bit of investigation maybe give it a five i would say
um
what do you what do you all think
six
or maybe six because it's just one one i one among the issues i mean
mm
yeah i think i think for um i mean most people are right handed so in in terms of our greatest target group
yeah
i think it's pretty good but we might want to flag it for management they want might want to um
yeah
one more thing is that i
okay
it might be a little clumsy when when it opens up right so it opens on the side
they
mm-hmm
no yeah but mm but we have it nicely with the hinges here yeah
so
yeah yeah yeah i mean yeah
so it won't be a problem it will be and it will be it won't be heavy
yeah
yeah
so you guys can decide wh whether
yeah
oops
i th i think the alternative is flipping from the top
yeah well yeah but it's it's a bit long
yeah but we which makes it kind of really big yeah
the length is gonna be difficu
it's a little bit long
well i mean it can be opened like this of course and yeah
yeah um
but you were thinking about making it smaller yeah
uh this this kind of uh makes it more and two it might interfere with the i. r. channel
mm
because
s uh slightly smaller
so you have to keep that side flat
yeah but if we flip it open only as much as that
okay
so it works like a mobile phone flipping but y you know as long as that side's flat than that will work
right
okay
okay
um okay so c.
are are we admitting defeat on c. or are we saying we're gonna stick a locator on the t. v.
no we're gonna put it like we've got th there's the locator dot
no we have a locator
there's a locator
cool so that means you need a that does mean you need a little speaker on it though doesn't it
mm that you stick on t. v.
mm
to make it beep
yeah well w but l but the speak sample speaker is included
yeah
or a buzzer
yeah
so it it has some capacity to mm to do some to make some sounds so yeah
okay
yeah
so that's two so that's seven yeah
it's locatable
yep
fabulous
d.
intuitive completely intuitive
yeah
if uh uh if this means intuitive if it means the way people kind of are used to finding things and it's i th i think it's
yeah
i'd say six 'cause the i mean the the standard layout for numbers is three three three and one rather than the way you've got it
i really like the way you have it but it's not the immediate thing that you're used to
yeah
intuitive
yeah and i mean d
so
and uh even the scroll
it's a it's a new technology so m m might be a little more difficult for people to get used to in the beginni so it is kind of not very intuitive but uh it's a good technology
might be
but it and it's something that they will be experiencing in a lot of different places soon
i mean once they get used to it
yeah
yeah
so should we maybe say f a five and say it is intuitive but it's different
so l
five
so do you know i mean it's obvious how to use it but you might have to think about it first
yeah
so we give that one a five you think
yeah okay
i'm happy with five
yep
i'm gonna give a seven in everything so
yeah
yeah
i'm glad you're accepting this
it has taken a little while hasn't it
um intuitive
but
sorry it's really hard to write on those
i just went a bit mad didn't i
mm
um okay cool e. okay
um i would guess this comes back from this whole b. thing links in here so possibly for left handed
investigate
yep
but otherwise it's superb
so should we give it a six
six
six
um uh the ergonom ergonomic design well mm i mean i d uh i dunno i mean the the repetitive stress things
yeah
but then who would be really pushing the buttons so much on the on the remote control anyway yeah
yeah
yeah unless you are a all the time sitting
see
yeah so it's kinda
yeah
well we've banned them from
yeah i i think it is ergonomic
i used to send fifty texts a day you know and i never got repetitive strain injury from that
mm yeah
so i find it quite hard to believe to be honest
yeah
and moreover it it has um l. c. d. and everything so that uh you know uh we minimise the pressing of the buttons anyway
yeah
yeah it's varied
yeah
okay so we give that a six yeah
six
okay f.
yeah it does have yeah
absolutely
voice control have seven
hang on how come it's showing up with the things there but it only had bullet points there
that's just
ah that's the second one
so you must have changed it on this one where it's got score but not on the previous slide
oh okay cool
um right so
so it has voice control
yes so that's a seven then
yep
um cool
g. technologically innovative
anyway it ha yeah it's the most sophisticated remote that i ever seen
technologi well
but in terms of the actual technology none of it is actually new
yeah
well mm we have we have the sample speaker as well which is yeah it's kind of new
yeah
yeah but i mean you don't
all of the components have been used in other things before
but at the same time they are all they are all relatively new
yeah but they've been brought together in a remote
they're never been used i they've never been using remote remote control before i don't think
but do yeah yeah
yeah
what do you reckon five six
yeah what do you all think
six
six
yeah
i mean how how far can you go with a remote control really
yeah
well that's it i mean
it still has to do what i what it has to do
yeah but i mean everything has been used in space before it gets to anyone else really hasn't it
so i don't think many peop
space remote
that's it they can take it with them
put fashion in electronics
absolutely
yeah isn't it fashionable
yeah sure
the carrot banana remote
it's the maximum fashion
so we give it seven and we write
fruit fruit and vegetables are fashionable these days so
there we go
so i think we've done very well but
i think that's a
cool
very good
what's the assessment
yeah
so we need the average here so we got
the average is about six and something
yeah one
a little bit over six
seven
or a seven
there are how many sixes
no wait a little bit under six
so we've got four sevens so that's twenty eight three sixes eighteen
one two three
no wait
three
and one five
oh three sixes okay yeah
fifty one one two three four five six seven eight
okay twenty eight thirty eight fo forty six
four sevens
forty six and five fifty one
six point point about six point five
fifty one divided by
six point something yeah
two three four
six point five yeah
seven eight
close enough
okay that's pretty good i think
now wait until we get to finance and then we'll see if we can afford it
that's all you've got at the moment or did you have anything more
um no that's it yeah
that's it
alright
so finance
and we'll see if we can
unscrew this first
cool there we go
sorry this is i'm just um
there we go and there are the marks
beautiful
yeah
not anymore
computer no signal
mm i guess it'll have to wait for a bit
adjusting
there we go
okay so we've looked at the prototype presentation and the evaluation criteria
and now we have to calculate the production costs
so i've got an excel spreadsheet to help us do that
can you read that
almost
more or less
um i started filling it in but of course these are provisional so we have to go down
no hand dynamo right
yeah
yeah
one simple battery
mm
no kinetic energy no solar
the chip we're going for an advanced chip on print
advanced yeah
we also said the sample sensor and sample speaker
yep
um single curved surface so that we can fold it
yeah yes
case material we said rubber
rubber
yep
i don't know what special colour means
mm anything uh i think which is not more
i think something coloured yeah probably
so i think this is probably special co no
it could be
yeah
yeah but rubber comes coloured doesn't it
rub rubber comes coloured it's i would maybe it's like if you want titanium coloured or wood coloured it's different
you know
yeah
or maybe maybe if you want some kind of pattern thing on it yeah yeah okay
yeah let's leave it as zero 'cause it's easy
yeah
yeah you might end up having to take off the
we we're definitely going to have to so we've got pushbutton and then we've
we have pushbuttons
mm
sample sensor
scro we have scroll wheel as well
scroll wheel with pushbutton we had no
s for the muting
s yeah yeah we had for muting yeah
no uh we we have uh yeah
yeah
and we have l. c. display and yeah
and button supplements
um
mm no
no
we don't have we're not using any of that
no
no
yeah but what do we ha we have l. c. display but but the wh but the s spinning wheel
but the the spinning wheel's not there
i have think maybe it's integrated with the l. c. display
yeah
okay let's yeah
we've got more than one pushbutton though haven't we
i think the pushbutton oh
'cause then you have
i don't know if that's one
that means you can only have twenty five push buttons in total doesn't it
not counting anything we'd still be in budget
yeah
that seems unlikely
push what uh whether whether pushbutton means that p count by button or do we i don't think that makes sense
huh
wh wh what is the limit
uh
twelve point five
we have to count all of them or yeah
mm i don't think so no
no
well it doesn't but it uh
no it says what what is the kind of interface if it is pushbutton then you got a zero point five
no
it's a scroll wheel so we we've put it's pushbutton and scroll wheel and l. c. d. display so that's that's the three kind of interfaces that we have
yeah
and l. c. display
yeah
yeah
yeah
so as we can see that's way too expensive down here
wh wh what's our criteria
this sample sensor
our budget's twelve point five
uh okay
yeah the sample sensor will have to go 'cause that's the most expensive thing on there
yeah so that has implications though for the
uh it does not have for voice recognition but it does have for the feedback speaker
when you say when you press one it says one or it says hello
yeah
for the locator
but that's a bit of a gimmick anyway really isn't it
yeah
mm and the locator also goes away
we can afford to get rid of it
but it was very no innovative innovativeness
yeah
so that means no locator does it
well um yeah
i mean does
what else does it need
well the speaker uh the sample speaker is is expensive but we could just have some some very very easy device that just beeps
yeah 'cause the sample speaker was i think more complicated then just a beeping thing
this would be
yeah yeah yeah there you record your samples your speech samples and
yeah
yeah
yeah okay so we
a also i in the case i'm not sure that you will evaluate this as a curved surface
because it's just rubber so it's probably a flat surface rubber
uh i mean uh um yeah
uh-huh
okay yeah
right so we need one fifty off
um
see i was gonna say the scroll wheel pushbutton thing 'cause
take it down to just a scroll wheel
we could do
so tha that mean that we cannot press how do we how do we make a selection in uh in the l. c. d.
yeah then then we would be in the b budget
if in the l. c. d. we can scroll right
but how do we make a selection if we d cannot push the button
yeah b no no you can push this one but we don't have a pushbutton uh we ca we don't have this muting mechanism for this scrolling thing
but that's well you would just have to to spin it down
yeah
you can have to scroll it straight r roll it straight down for for mute
mm-hmm
so that's point three
no w w w but ha it's it's the scroll wheel and i thought we were referring to this as a scroll spinning wheel and pushbutton thing
but i mean we can put an additional mute button on the top as well
if you
yeah i mean that wouldn't actually cost any more
that's the spin wheel though isn't it
didn't that come with the l. c.
that's with the l. c.
that comes with the l. c. d.
yeah
we decided 'cause it's not on our list
yeah
oh so so the the this is
mm
the scroll wheel is on the side
so we're adding costs for right okay uh i mean i think this is good
so
s so we're point three over
we're point three over at the moment
it's nothing n
unless we just take off the scroll wheel altogether and just have pushbuttons for the volume
could b still put them on the side
but yeah
yeah i have
i mean the scroll wheel's pretty cool but
instead of scrolling here we have two buttons here up for up and down
yeah
mm-hmm
yeah
on the side
yeah
mm uh it sounds good actually yeah
okay yeah
rather than having three different things that people have to do
okay
there we go
oh look we're way under budget and we'll make huge profits and we'll all get bonuses
yeah well we could admit to the single curve couldn't we
or or that we have to have some sort of special colour
yeah but
so that's alright
we we'll leave it at that and then i'll take i can send it back to management and say we weren't quite sure about the colour
yeah
if that costs extra then we've still got some space for it yeah
we have yeah
yeah
yeah
excellent
alright
so did we lose um on our evaluation criteria as a result of doing that
no
no i don't think so
not really no
because we keep all the features we keep voice recognition we keep l. c. d. display
mm
yeah
we instead of having scrolling we we just push the buttons
yeah
we just got rid of a gimmick that was never anyway
yeah
um yeah
and the scroll wheel is i mean essentially the two buttons that was it's not a great difference i don't think
yeah
yeah
alright then
but we lose the locator
well we're going to have a beeping thing
really
we're gonna have a beep
so instead of speaker
but yeah it's it's not like sample speaker but it will just beep so we still have the locate
yeah
yeah
'kay
cool
that's not a very exciting colour
i think you should make it more vegetable like
tha
which colour the the colour of the phone or the colour of the
oh the the beeper thing
but it can be yellow as well
it
it can come in the same colour as the the case
'cause we we won't have run out of our pot of play doh
yeah i think jen wants it to vibrate
yeah i know i know my pen vibrates
you know your pen vibrates
yeah
but only for a very short time
um
okay
so
looks like we've designed a
banana
well done team
um we need we've just got about ten minutes or so left of the meeting
so it would be good if we could just have a little talk about the project itself and how it went
um so that we can feed back to the management for next time they're designing a product
i think it mm
cool
feedback
ideas
yeah mm as far as creativity is concerned yeah i think there was there was room for creativity
the only the only problem being that at the end we had to cut some things down because of the the budget we had
mm-hmm
i think uh n one thing that was lacking uh was that we did not know what the various things cost to begin with
mm-hmm
yeah
um we kap kept a adding things randomly
yeah
so had we known
if we'd had that sheet at the beginning should've been like okay
yeah that or not yeah
so we can have that lot let's just throw it together and do what we can
mm-hmm
yeah yeah yeah
yeah
so d all the random decisions at the end could have been prevented
yeah
mm
but in terms of the process of um going and working individually and then coming back to a meeting that that worked in terms of
yeah mm
i think 'cause the meetings were so regular you know
mm-hmm
it wasn't like we were alone for very long so you didn't st go off and think
wouldn't it be great to have a vibrating remote control shaped like a banana
mm-hmm
banana
and then you know come back three days later and jen's going look look it vibrates and it looks like a banana
yeah
um yeah so yeah
yeah the m the means were very very good the means we used
mm-hmm the whiteboard digital pens
and the pens
uh i like the pens
we like the pens
i want one
that would just be so cool to d do all your notes and s
yeah you could take it to lectures and just write stuff down and have it printed out when you got back to the office
yeah yeah yeah that's it's it's i wonder what one of these costs
yeah yeah
they great
do you think they'd notice if one went
i don't think you should say that was the recording
oh okay
okay cover up the microphone
alright let's take it
yep
shh
yep
okay
but that worked well having having a whiteboard that we could draw on as well as having the powerpoint
'cause the i find that the problem with powerpoint often is that it's so static and you can't change it once you're in there yep
it is a bit limiting isn't it
yeah
yeah
yeah
yeah and and and this time also the time limits but actually preparing the
yeah
the thing flew in you didn't have the whole whooshing thing 'cause there wasn't time for that so yeah
mm-hmm
yeah
yeah
that's alright that always irritates me anyway yeah
not that you can do that on the board either
we could make some little
but yeah but i mean already just just preparing the slides before before the meeting yeah
yeah totally i mean that was fairly tight anyway i mean especially with that last minute alteration
mm
yeah
yeah
mm yeah
back it this is just had to be changed
and yeah so cool
yeah
are we supposed to say nice things about jen now
and presumably you don't you can say nasty things as well
yeah
i was i was satisfied with with the leadership yeah
i have no stake in it
yeah definitely
yeah
you weren't like a a dictating leader so that was always good
you have to say that 'cause i'm taking the notes
mm-hmm
i'll leave the room and you can have another go
i know you've got the pen you might attack me with it
better than that than the banana
and then the teamwork i think i think it worked quite quite nicely yeah
i think it worked quite well
yeah
yeah
did anyone feel that they were getting sort of covered up and not being able to
say their bit
to express them mm mm no
mm
i guess it was a fairly small group so all of us got to express our opinions yeah
yeah
yeah
new ideas found
not quite sure what about
well it's it's it's pretty new pretty novel solution for a for a remote control really all this flipping open thing and
yeah
mm
yeah
i don't know i don't go shopping for remote controls that often maybe somebody's already though of it
yeah neither neither do i but i've never seen anything and and none of my examples were was was like this actually so
mm-hmm
yeah
hmm
yeah
i'll be looking out next time i need to write an essay
yeah that's right
that looks boring i'll see if anyone's made a remote control
yeah maybe w maybe we could have a patent on this one
yeah yeah
yeah
patent patent patent
banana remote
i think we'd like to think the ideas were new but we've got no way of finding out
mm
yeah
mm-hmm
or you can always go to google and type in banana remote control
that vibrates
flip
vibrate
yeah but that would just come up with like other things really wouldn't it
and uh yeah
nothing that you really want
true
yeah
okay
so costs are within budget well within budget including a little what have we got
yes
yes
one euro left over for bits that we didn't foresee
um we've evaluated
yes
the project
you've got the scores
and it's fabulous
can you put that in the project documents file
it's in the project documents
it's in there already
and the process wheel didn't really have any major problems with
were there any was there anything that you found difficult or anything
that didn't go as smoothly as you'd hope
and my main difficulty was the the time pressure
yeah
otherwise it's it's all fine
yeah yeah sometimes it's like a little bit rushed
mm-hmm
i thought that was good though because if you're given too much time then you got nothing to do with your time and um yeah
yeah yeah yeah
although we could have made the r. s better had we had five more minute
yeah
okay then
um i think we're still well within our
yeah we've got like five minutes left
time
we've got about five minutes left but if we've finished then we've finished
yeah
we're just too too efficient and you should never drag a meeting on just because you have extra time
we certainly are mm
yeah
yeah
yes
so i would say that's the end of that meeting
yeah it was a pleasure working with you
thank you team
'kay
yeah same here
it was very productive day and
we could draw animals on the board again
mm uh no
mm uh no
i don't think so
you can make some animals
i don't like play doh no
oh you don't like anim
it's just minging
it smells so bad
it doesn't
it does
smells quite nice
smells very sweet
mm
right so we have to complete the final questionnaire and meeting summary when they send it
was there a questionnaire already sent
i don't know if it's already sent or not
no it hasn't been
um presumably i have to
do we have to go back into the other room or can we stay in here now
i don't see why you can't stay here really
okay so the other way
did i save this one
production costs
i made your animal for you
it was supposed to be pink
yeah that's the one
but it was blue on the board
mm-hmm
okay
ooh
so we're 'kay
on the or
no
i dunno where to put it 'cause the
okay
could you s take it off
is that alright
or
okay
okay
keeps coming off
's fiddly
hmm
right
how do we sta wa how do we start
does anybody know
oh another one
so that's this
oh okay right
are we free to take notes uh
okay
uh
hmm
okay just hang on a second everybody
i haven't actually looked at this yet
ah
um
very nice
i haven't looked at it but let's just start it off and we'll see what happens
if you're all ready
yeah
so is the agenda
opening acquaintance tool training and project plan discussion and then closing
project aim is a new remote control
it's original uh trendy and it's user friendly
'kay
project method functional design individual work another meeting conceptual design individual work and a meeting of details design individual work and a meeting
tool training
try out the whiteboard every participant should draw their favourite animal and sum up their favourite characteristics of that animal
okay
um
uh miss industrial designer would you like to go first
okay
so are we supposed to bring the little things for the
yeah why don't you just c i think just clip on clip do you have a belt
clip
mm
or put 'em in your pocket yeah
yeah
okay
so my favourite animal
yeah what's your favourite animal
'kay um
ah
is it rude
it's an elephant
that's a very good elephant
the back end of an elephant
oh my gosh i'm never gonna be able to draw that well
'kay and you want to write up on there it says you've gotta sum up your f f your favourite characteristics of that animal
um okay it's big it's got a great memory
does it
oh
supposed to have a great memory we say an elephant never forgets
mm
mm
and uh dunno know why but looks like nice to me
okay
nice animal
wonderful well done
do you want to use the wipe the m the wiper and wipe it off
okay
and mister aesthetics designer do you wanna go next
aesthetic yep sure
i have no idea what my favourite animal is
'kay my favourite animal uh let's see
oh
it's
dunno if any of you have seen napoleon dynamite before
it's a liger a combination of a lion and tiger
no
a what
alright
have you not seen napoleon dynamite
how
no
no
no
oh it's a hilarious movie
you have to see it
and
and it's best characteristic is it's pretty much
the awesomest
animal
but you have to see the movie to fully appreciate it
okay well done
great
me
yeah
miss mar miss marketing
okay
not quite sure how this is gonna work
there go
cool
uh well i'll try my best to draw
can i just draw the face
um yeah i think you can just draw the face but then you'll have to describe in writing how the rest of it looks
ooh
it's a cat
that's a very pr pretty cat
which also has what
a big fat body and
big and a long tail
okay do y do you wanna do some write you wanna just write some words about it
why
because um cuddly
and usually cats are very friendly
usually
and they're healing as well
they heal
and they can feel when a human's got problems so
wow so they're kinda spiritual
so that's why i like cats
well done
there we are that's me
okay
mm
um i don't actually have a favourite animal but for the for th for this meeting i'll s draw a little
mm-hmm
uh
i honestly can't draw for toffee
really
uh
oh that's a
yeah
no no uh
a prairie dog
oh a squirrel
that's exactly what it is
uh not a very good one
not bad i would say
yeah that's pretty good
okay well you got it's a s
it's a squirrel and i like them because they're cute
and stupid
very good
ah
alright
right
okay so i guess that was the test to see if this equipment is all working
mm
let's move on to the next page
okay project finance selling price twenty five euros profit aim fifty million euros
market range internationally sold
yeah
production cost ah right it's gotta be can't cost any more than twelve fifty to make
ah right okay
experience with with remote control so talk about who who's used what
any ideas
stuff like that
next meeting starts in thirty minutes
at quarter to twelve
so i think before we close uh we are expected i mean the last slide wanted us to maybe discuss longer what our
what our ideas where
i mean if you wanna go back to the last slide
uh
yeah
yeah
s
yeah i think we're i mean before we close the meeting we're supposed to come up with some ideas for
oh k so we're actually supposed to be doing this discussion like right now are we or oh okay
yeah
yeah
mm
yeah
i thought this was just t giving us instructions for the re to do next but
yeah i think this is just the preliminary get some rough ideas for what our experiences with remote controls have been and and what we would
roughly what we would incorporate into a new one maybe
okay
right who's got experiences with remote controls then
pretty much everybody
yeah
yeah i think we've all got
uh
um
is this a t. v. one we are supposed to make
yeah
yeah it's a t. v. remote control
okay
'kay um
well
t
a new remote control for t. v.
what would i like
w what
um
you want it big do you want it small
medium
are we are we going for like like telephones are going little teeny tiny things or we are going for something that's that's big and
mm
yeah it seems like there's like there's sort of a tension between two ideas i mean
you want you want one remote that maybe can work uh all all of the functions of t. v. and if you have whatever associated with t. v. the d. v. d. player
video and ts hi fi and stuff
or something like that but like at the same time you don't wanna really busy remote with a thousand buttons on it or something
maybe you yeah now th that's the other thing is it's gotta be cheap
mm
yeah
'cause i i i mean i was thinking something that's got different like maybe a a an l. c. d. display on it that's got different pages for different devices
mm
but that would p that would probably be quite expensive
but how do we know how much uh i mean how much do we have per how much
twelve fifty
twelve fifty
it g can't be more than twelve fifty per unit
each
per unit yeah
cost
so do we have to be realistic within the budget or
well at the moment we could
close pr i don't know how much it would cost
guess
wa i mean we 'cause we this is what we th what we're doing at the moment is just saying what what we'd like
yeah
and then after we after we've found out what we can like
some different ideas we can then go and do the research to find out if these any of these ideas are feasible or not
right
so would be nice to have something that that controls lots of different things
yeah
um
couldn't we have like one that comes out
like so you have one in like mm it doesn't have to be really thick
yeah
i mean remote controls can be thin bits
and then you have one for your d. v. d. and you sort of slide it out and then you have another one you slide it out
'kay
have slides
and then it all comes compact
okay that's
into one
so it's not you actually just putting three or four different remotes together but making them thinner and um into one basically
th that's an idea
yeah
so you just flip them out
okay
um have uh one very complicated one on one side with all the d. v. d. and v. c. r. access and stuff
and then on the other side o one uh a remote control that would be very very simple with just the channel
program plus and minus and the just the mute button for example
i can real keep it really really simple on one side and the other side be very complicated
one side for kids one side for adults
i'm not sure if that's like
yeah
or grandma as well you know it's like what is the mute button
i'm not sure if it's a good idea to have a two sided remote though
'cause it would be very hard to use in the way that you mani manipulate it
no but you would slide it into uh someth like something on the back would hold like you wouldn't be able to press the buttons but
oh
oh okay
like it or something like a flip telephone something like that maybe
yeah
okay
that would be cool
i was thinking that like a flip
f flip it open and you've got all the buttons or you flip it closed and you've just got the basic buttons on the outside maybe
mm-hmm
um oh we've got five minutes left
start breaking up
okay
but okay
um
well we've got a k we've got a few ideas there
yeah we should uh i guess by the end of this meeting we should have at least a a rough conception you know stage one was technical functions design
what effect the apparatus should have
okay
um so i mean we still have time in our next meeting to come up with the actual concept for the user interface
but the the functions that we're sure that we want are that it can control the t. v.
but also devices connected to the to the t. v. i mean be able to operate
yeah
d. v. d. players things like that
i have got i think we should also have a back up plan of i 'cause i i i just think that it might be expensive to make something that i mean we don't
we haven't been told it has to be something that will control everything
yeah
we should have a back up plan of just a really good television remote control
yeah
that just that is just for a t. v. but it's just a really good nice one
okay
right
what do you reckon
yeah i mean
see 'cause i'm just thinking bearing in mind th we've gotta we have to have something that's cheap to make
yeah that's true maybe we should just concentrate on having a a good t. v. remote and have it be um
i think we'll be able to come up with ideas and stuff a lot quicker
have it be like ergonomic so it's comfortable to use uh simple to use and looks decent and
yeah
may w you know maybe even
but what'll make it what'll make it interesting for people to buy though
or maybe even so something that's for disabled people or so people that uh b don't see very well or big buttons for touchy buttons for
i mean if it's if it's just like
sorta find a niche for our remote like market it to a certain kind of p kind of people
yeah
yeah
certain certain demographic
or just one that looks really fucking cool
mm-hmm
yeah no i think you're right
could be really light or i dunno something special
yeah rathe rather than focus on
otherwise we'll be we'll be here all day talking about do this let's do that n i think we sh i think we should
y
yeah
yeah 'cause at the end of the day if it says just t. v. remote doesn't say com combination with all all the r
yeah
yeah
i mean obviously everyone we're uh you know uh sounds like we're all a bit sort of gadget heads and we like things that do everything at once
remotes spinning out from other remotes and having little nested remotes inside
but you know that's
yeah
mm
yeah that's right
yeah
i mean i'd like one that makes tea as well but that's not gonna happen
i think a flip up thing 'cause you always have this problem of like if it's on this well i did anyway
like we had five or six remotes and they would be lying on the c on the coach
and you'd come and sit down and ooh the telephone's the television switched on or something
so maybe something that like
does have a lid or closes so you don't accidentally press a button or record button for something
okay like a lock f like a lock functs function on it like you have on your telephones yeah
yeah
but make it like really snazzy and cool people will want it
so make it yeah
yeah it's gotta be sellable
yeah
yeah
yeah that's true what you were saying i mean it doesn't have to have a flip function it can just have a lock function
so that it's not uh not usable when you don't want it to be usable
mm
yeah
mm
yeah
okay
and even for kids as well
it's um it's safer for them i guess
like they don't flick onto
channels and all that sl flick onto
no porn channel for children
okay
okay
um alright so we've got some ideas we've got um
i guess that's good good for now
let's move on
mm
oops let's close that
next meeting uh okay
w what does i. d. v. i. d. n. m. e. stand for
industrial designer um which is
ah ri okay
these are requirement specification
that's
um
and i'm marketing
mm
yeah there you go
so
user interface designer that's that's that's you so you gotta you go you're you're gonna be the one that's working out what what buttons we need
that's me
okay
right
right
um
industrial designer you are the one you know you're gonna be working out kind of box it goes in i guess so um
whether it's what goes into the box somehow
mm
har how it works an
and in marketing
these are requirement specification
bu
user requirements specifications
so what the user requires
yeah what
do you think our two kind of overlap because
in a remote
right okay yeah
yeah it does seem like our our responsibilities have some overlap
i guess that's what it says
you two you two are gonna be just i think you just double up you know you working together
yeah
yeah
you're the one that's gotta go and find out do th do the research
see what people want in a remote what buttons are used more often and s stuff like that
mm
oh we've been warned to finish the meeting now
okay
okay everyone well done
good meeting
alright see you in thirty minutes
yeah
so do we take these off
i don't
think we can first
right it was function f. eight or something
mm
this one right there
tha
okay
okay
who is gonna do a powerpoint presentation
think we all
huh
you will as well
oh i thought we all were
yeah i have one too okay
okay
s
yep
whoops i forgot to put the thing on
right
i just wanna 'cause basically i can't re i've really crap at remembering everyone's name so i just wanna rather than going uh miss marketing and miss this and miss that wanted to know your names again
okay
okay i'm
just gonna leave this up here 'cause i'll you know
yeah
okay
sure that's a good idea
so
i'm catherine with a c.
c. a. t. h.
e. r.
i. n. e.
okay and gabriel
uh gabriel
e. l. is it
e. l.
'kay
and you're s r r. e. i. s. s.
i am reissa
r. e. i. s. s. a.
double s. a. yeah yeah
sorry
okay
's just a bit nicer calling people by their names i think
right
true
uh right
mm 'kay
okay right welcome to meeting b.
um this is gonna go a lot better than the last meeting basically uh 'cause i know what i'm supposed to be doing now
i am your project manager and uh yeah i'm just here to
sort of liaise between the three of you and get things going
get people talking and and i'm gonna be making notes and sending them off to the powers that be and stuff basically
um right this for the purposes of this meeting what this meeting is all about is um i'm gonna have some presentations from all three of you
what you've been working on for the last
wee while when you haven't been getting hit with spam on your computers and and you know filling out silly questionnaires and things
but hopefully you've been actually been doing something productive
so we're gonna each of you gonna give us a litt a little presentation
mm
um
then we're gonna work you know from each of your presentations
we'll we'll uh talk about what we actually need as a final coming together of it all
um and then we'll yeah we'll sort of conclude anything else comes up at the end of it
how long is the meeting
this meeting it's not very long
it's uh probably down to about thirty five minutes now
okay
so i want each of your presentations to not be too long five five minutes something like that
no problem
um if you haven't done a powerpoint thingy it doesn't matter it it just it just says that you it's that's just one particular medium
if you haven't had time to prepare one you can draw stuff on the noteboard
you can talk to us you can you know however you want to do your little presentation basically you can
don't feel pressurised into using this thing
'cause i don't
uh okay
so um
you okay over there
reissa
i'm fine
yeah
are you uh b are you joining in with this meeting here or are y or are y or are you are you just are you just uh doing some internet shopping there
i uh yeah yeah
think she's finishing up her presentation
d i mean i i'm finishing off my presentation
no no
uh i'm done
okay
okay jolly good
alright let's have um well we all know that it's it's a remote control that we're gonna be dealing with
i think the first thing we should look at is um probably the um what it is that it is actually supposed to be
mm
so that's gonna be you catherine if we wanna hear from you first
okay
okay
um just connecting this
are we getting i
you don't have to worry about screwing it in just there you go
really
okay
cool
okay
so i've got a very quick uh
uh
okay
so the working design i've got a very quick presentation on this so um i've oh no you can't see a thing
oh well i'm gonna draw it on the board then
it's in blue uh and i couldn't change it
oh
we it's fine on my screen but never mind
ah
so um the idea is that we've got the
energy source um which in our case will pr oh well okay never mind
so um i think maybe uh two batteries i dunno what they're called six or something like that
mm-hmm
uh and then
um
then on the uh remote control itself will have um the sender for the signal which could be uh
an infra red signal
um which will be sent by an electronic chip
and uh the chip will be controlled by the user interface
so we'll hear about that later from gabriel
mm-hmm
and uh the sender will send to the telly itself an infra red signal to tell it to switch on or switch channels
um and that's it really for the working design
great
okay
sorry the presentation wasn't very uh clear but
i prefer the pe i prefer the human touch personally
really
cool
yeah
um should i erase this or
do you wanna just give us a moment i just wanna copy this down
okay
um i dunno if you guys have got any questions for catherine on any of this
fine
or suggestions
is a battery like
the only way of
well it's just you don't want it plugged in really s
yeah alternate energy source like win wind power or
yeah you blow on it and i
no no
in indoors
no i meant like
bicycle power
no 'cause like cha 'cause always changing um um batteries can get like annoying
the battery's down and maybe i dunno solar charged
i dunno swi i th i th i think changing your batteries once every six months is not really a pain but
yeah it's worked for the last fifty years you know
mm
yeah
one question i have and i don't know how much control we have over this is um
as far as the infra red signal do we have control over
you know how far away you can be from the receiving unit the the t. v. and still have it be operational
i mean maybe we want one with a strong signal stream
how far away is your television
yeah
it's never gonna be more than it's never gonna be
uh
well the thing is uh you you don't
you kno unless you've got a t. v. the size of a football pitch it's not doesn't have to go that far does it
doesn't have to go through a wall because you're not gonna be looking through a wall
yeah
that's true
but if like you're on the phone in the other room and you need turn television off or something and you don't really want to go into the put the telephone down
and go into the other room
well we can make the the signal strong enough to go through walls if if you fancy it
i didn't think about that
how about bluetooth
but
instead of using infra red
use bluetooth
why not
isn't that a better signal
i just think that it's it's gonna cost more and i'm i'm not sure it's you're gonna use it
yeah yeah i d it sounds like you you w don't wanna overcomplicate things
mm
you know we don't need it
it's a fancy idea uh it's quite nice but then i don't th i dunno
either you if you wanna watch the telly you're in the room you are gonna
yeah exactly
basically we're we're desi we're designing and marketing a television remote control unit
but
we're not w w w w designing something that you can plug in a headset to and and you know connect to your laptop computer and stuff
it's uh
mm
oh we can we can keep the idea if you i
we can see at a later stage maybe i don't
's just an idea
okay
right well done catherine
um gab gabriel let's uh let's hear from you on on on such things
okay
do you need the border
uh i'm just gonna use the powerpoint uh
okay
sorry
technical
okay
adjusting
okay so while this is warming up there it is uh
yeah
so i'm doing the user interface design
mm-hmm
yeah and basically uh as far as methods i was i was looking looking at
looking at uh already existing remotes trying to find some inspiration from designs that are already out there
thinking of what we can retain what we can do away with uh what we what we can perfect a little bit as far as design um
we don't want to do something that's too radical of a change i guess i mean people want a remote that's familiar
that has their favourite functionalities um and and does the basics but
mm yeah
um so we can improve what's out there and maintain that
the basic functionality that people want
um so things that seem like absolute must haves uh would be a volume control
um so up down keys for that uh channel keys up down
but then also a numerical key pad so that they can just key directly to the channel that they want
rather than doing up down and uh a mute button
uh one thing that i didn't include here that i forgot that we talked about last time was doing um some sort of lock uh function
uh i don't i dunno uh that's one possibility
okay
and so in the research that i was doing
there's basically two types of remotes ones that are engineering centred and ones that are more user centred
which i don't know if i can access the web page from here but i can show you uh
yeah
so this is a engineer centred one so you see it's rather busy but it also lets you play your movie
stop your movie fast forward all this um freeze frame
mm-hmm
uh and this is a user centred one
uh it's it's easier to g just glance at this and see what's possible to do you're not gonna be staring at it for five minutes
yeah
great
and i judging from what what we all talked about during our last meeting i kind of gathered that that's what we were going after
uh or the direction we were going in at least
um
so the engineering centred ones uh provide a lot of functionality
but it can be a little bit overwhelming so the user centred ones just focus on ease of use
uh and this sort of overlaps with what the marketing person uh reissa
because uh we we need to find out what what people want before we make firm decisions on this
mm
yeah
so uh yeah that's me
great
okay
now that's i just have a q a q question for you
this w um research that you've been doing looki looking at other you know existing units stuff
um have you found that anyone else has do has looked into the locking function or
no that that that seemed like a novel idea as f as far as i know
i mean obviously another exists like you like you said in in mobile phones
yeah
that was sort of the inspiration for it
um i've never seen that with in in all my years in in the remote business
yeah
i've haven't i've never seen a locking functionality
i dunno what uh do you guys have a a yea or nay on that a feeling about whether that's really necessary
um
i would say
it's
if it's simple to do
which i think it probably should be even if it's a physical you know
yeah
a f a like a f a physical switch or a physical cover for the remote even something like that
mm-hmm
'kay
um then yes it's like you know
like s you said earlier on ab ab ab a flip thing something like that but you know being physical
right
look into
um i've had word down from head office that something that we should be centred well
something we should take into account is um we've gotta keep the corporate image within this remote control unit
it's gotta d look like it's in the r. and r.
mm
you know the the company it's it's from what i can see from our other products are yellow with blue writing on them
mm
right
um
and our motto is is we put the fashion in electronics
we put the fashion in electronics
mm
i think i think we have to carry that mental
there you go
so it's kinda gotta look it's gotta look new and s you know something fashionable
if if remote control well if telephones can be fashionable then maybe remote control units can be
mm
mm
well yeah these i think
we can so we talked about the layout in my presentation and what i didn't mention yet really is is the sort of like the ergonomic design
yeah
because we need
i t i think we can make big improvements over these two that you see here i mean
yeah
uh everything is going t ergonomic you know
great
there's you know mice for your computers that are very ergonomic and keyboards and that could be one of our niches p sort of uh uh in the market
i guess
okay fantastic
um
right well done gabriel
okay
um reissa
where does it go into
let's plug you in baby
here
yeah
the blue thing
uh yeah this is getting all
mm
yeah then you just have to do function f. eight and it should come up
well function f. eight
no oh
yeah w it it just takes a wee while
yeah it just takes a second uh
come on
right
okay
okay
well for our marketing report uh we observed remote control users in a usability lab
and also gave so this is research and we also gave participants um questionnaires to fill out
um total number of people tested were a hundred just so you know so that hundred people were tested and these were the findings
so seventy five per cent of users find the remote control ugly
okay so they don't like the look of the remote control
um eighty f eighty per cent of them would spend more money if the rem remote control looked really cool and fancy
so i think we all agree with that
um current remote controls do not match well with the operating behaviour of the user
so they don't like like the way they operate it doesn't
like match how people behave
um per cent of the users say that they only use ten per cent of the buttons on a remote so probably if you have like one
two three four five the whole up to z ten they probably don't use those they only use the up and down channel
'cause we've only got five channels
exactly
that's another thing
um seventy five per cent of users say they zap
not quite sure what they mean zap goes like
i think that's k flicking quickly between channels
yeah you wanna navigate the channels quickly i guess
yeah
yeah
mm
um takes too much time to learn how to use a new remote
i think especially for uh the older generation
i know my grandmother doesn't like mobile phones takes ages to work how to use
anyway um and they also remotes often get lost in the room so nobody can find them
mm
so maybe tracking devices is a good idea
um personal preferences
wow
you are a child of technology aren't you
um so yeah um i was thinking something easy to use especially for older people
um has to look really cool flashy groovy for people to buy it
and it's easy to find so i don't know whether maybe and also we asked them whether they wanted whether they'd be interested in um voice activating
so voice activation
so and this was what we came up with
then if you look fifteen to twenty five this is age sorry age groups
so fifteen to twenty five said like ninety two ninety one per cent of them said yes
so there you go yeah
um so basically the majority except for the forty five to fifty five year olds for some reason didn't want a voice activated one
and neither did the older generation but the younger generation who we are catering for
like who have most of the money nowadays do want a voice act speech recognition in a remote
uh but do the younger generation have the money
no i would i would say the older the older people yeah
they they don't
it's older generation they're the ones that have gone out and
well the twenty five to thirty five year old and thirty five and the thirty five to forty five
forty five point seven per cent say no so
people people from the age of thirty f there's a big drop off there
for people up to the age of thirty five you're kinda saying yeah they want it
um but no they're not sort of most people that have the money are people from the age of thirty five to fifty five
yeah that would be my guess as well
uh 'cause they're the ones that have been working for twenty years
so they don't
um d and tha and that's a that's quite a minority there so yeah it's not even like fifty fifty that's th thirty five per cent
well
these guys are growing up
what about just from the the prospective of our manufacturing cost
i mean if if it's twelve fifty per unit
yeah
i mean okay there's
voice activation might not be the best
i would say scra i'd say scrap that straight off
uh
um also with um with buttons a thing called r. s. i. so wrist sense huh
repetitive strain uh rep repetitive strain injury or like from doing
yeah repetitive strains injury so they don't i think people who watch t. v. maybe too often keep changing channel hurts their wrist
well maybe they shouldn't watch so much t. v. then
i don't think so
so y so it's so it's so you got so that's something we should have a look into then i when desi when designing the ergonomics of see have a look if um there's any w any medical background we can find out about this
yeah maybe not so hard
mm
mm
maybe it could be instead of pressing button it could be just touching a
yeah
let's jus we just want need to cover our arses so that people aren't gonna sue us in ten years' time
maybe
say your remote control gave me repetitive strain injury
yeah we should probably consult with our legal department uh
mm
yeah
they're having a lunch break at the moment but yeah
yeah
i'll see if i can get see if i can get hold of them for the next meeting
yeah
i think we can do some really in in that department the the ergonomic department we can make some some really good improvements
yeah
mm
maybe th the buttons not so high up so you don't have to press so much or we just like flat buttons something
mm
yeah
okay
so that is me
that's great thank you very much for that reissa
um okay so we've basically
we've decide we've d
we've decided that it's gonna be you know uh we're going for a basic television remote
it's gotta be safe to use it's gotta look cool
mm
it's gotta be cheap
s um
mm
now going back to the uh industrial design of it you know we were looking at whether to use maybe infra red or bluetooth
i think we should just go with the simplest option on everything uh and that would be infra red energy source that would be batteries
uh mean we we can look into using the s you know the little tiny weeny batteries all like special long lasting batteries
um
but a in there's no i don't think there's any point in making a remote control unit that's gonna last for fifty years
because technology will have changed and you know we won't have televisions in ten years' time
so
yep
i think we're all um pretty sussed on that
um
anyone have any questions
mm
everybody happy in their work
yeah it seems like we're all on the pretty much on the same page
now this is good we've got a good structure going on
we all know where we're going to
have you been ge has have any of you lot been getting loads of crap spam on your computers
oh it's probably just you 'cause you're the project manager
well just questionnaires
yeah
sell trying to sell your things
yeah stuff
um okay
do oh have you guys found out if we can if we can e mail stuff to each other
yeah you can
right
okay
do all you all know my e mail address
no i don't
i think he's participant one aren't you
well in the project announcement you've got the addresses i think
i
uh
so project manager it's participant one at a. m. i.
oh it's just participant one oh okay
yeah
can you all d e mail me your e mail addresses
well it's just w it's just it's just par participant one participant two
you have them i you have them but we'll send you an e mail
send me yeah yeah okay
you want to have friends don't you
so are we headed towards like a b a big yellow and black remote as far as maybe that's our next meeting that we discuss that
is it yellow and black or is it yellow and blue
i i kind of thought it was blue writing on a yellow background but i might be just going a bit
well it's like white on i white and blue on a black background with white with yellow borders
okay
maybe that's like getting ahead of ourselves
well
it wouldn't be
maybe you can come up with a few with a couple of different ideas
mm
can't we have different colours in the remotes so somebody can choose different col like does it have to be of a certain
well see the thing is is we've gotta keep the company image
mm
it's gotta say people have gotta look at this remote control and instantly recognise that it's a real reaction i product
but if it's a r. r. it would be real reaction like if it had a symbol on it
mm
there's loads of companies that called r. r.
mm
whoa
this is slog but this is the slogan this is the the the the type
and this is something that came on down from from the higher ups so i mean we are sort of beholden to them
yeah
so we have to have it one colour
well not necessarily
not one colour but the pattern needs to be recognisable
but we have to incorporate it
mm
not necessarily even if i it just has to ye but you have to look at the product and instantly know that it's one of our products as opposed to a sony product or a
well you could
mm
you know a panasonic product
it's got to so maybe so you can have a look at our our other products and see if they all follow a s similar vein perhaps
it could come
but it could come in different colours and have the r. r. colours just somewhere like just around the lock button could be the r. r. logo or colours and
yeah
yeah
mm
if
quite poss yeah
well this is all your department
mm okay
well well done everybody
and um i think we uh stop for lunch now
yeah pretty soon i think i guess that's now
are we are we finished ahead of schedule
we might possibly have done
cool
alright see you all soon
if we've if we've finished at five minutes before the meeting's supposed to finish then that means we get an extra five minutes for lunch
'kay uh
yeah there you go
right
i just have to there's a few little bits and pieces i have to write down but
take your headsets off kick back smoke 'em if you got 'em
oh right okay
i cover myself up
i feel like madonna with one of these on
i said i feel like madonna with one of these on
i've always wanted one of these i really have
where do you buy 'em from
they're
right
hello everybody
hello
back again for another wonderful meeting
is uh everyone ready
yeah
yeah
almost
okay we c we can hold on for a minute
oh my gosh
i figured with the spam thing if you can't beat it join in
that's the kind of spam that everybody likes to receive
mm 'kay
are you ready
okay right well i take it that you are all ready now
um alright first off we'll just uh recap from our last meeting
um which was we got together just to basically decide on well to talk about what it is that we were actually uh supposed to be doing
and who we all are and stuff like that mm get bit more of an idea together of what's going on
um what we are gonna talk about in this meeting is um
now that we know what it is that we are doing
now we know that it's a t. v. remote and stuff and you guys have just been off doing some some uh r. and d. for that
that's research and development for those that haven't heard that before see i'm learning all sorts of new technologi terms in technology today
mm-hmm
um yeah we're gonna hear your uh th three little presentations whether they be on computer or on the whiteboard or whatever you want
hmm
do you have any preference uh of order
um i'd like to um hear o i'd like to hear who's g who's on the um from from uh catherine actually first
i want what i'd like to hear about is uh if we've finally decided on um what sort of energy we're gonna be using and
batteries
i think she is still finishing her
no no no no it's fine i'm just preparing
it's just that yeah let's let's hear from you first
hmm
okay
where is that thing
okay it's uh
it's here
oh sorry couldn't see
would that work
get yourself in position
okay so that's me again
ah
um so um for the energy sources we can have a basic battery
a hand dynamo which is which was used uh in the fifties for torches
if you remember that kind of which wouldn't be v wouldn't be v v yeah yeah
i don't think any of us remember the fifties
is it like a crank thing or something
it wouldn't be very fancy
you can have a kinetic provision of energy which is used on some watches these days
so if you have just a bit of gentle movement that it will give it the energy to work
mm
or you can use solar cells but i'm not sure about that indoors really but
well there's sometimes combinations i mean like calculators do combinations of battery with but also using some solar power
yeah
do sol solar panel things do they have to work from the sun or can they work from a light bulb
mm
i dunno actually
does anybody know
uh i think it has to be on the on the solar energy but i don't know
i dunno
um
think the the uh what would cost the less would be the basic battery really
okay
mm
and uh if we want something fancier i think the kinetic provision of energy could be nice but i don't know if it's worth the cost
so we've got to discuss that
mm
okay jolly good
for the case of the remotes itself um they can be a general case which is just a flat one
you can have uh a curved one or a double curved one if you know what i mean so
what's a double curved one
you know kind of more ergonomic that kind of suits the palm of your hand that kind of thing
so
okay
um then the case material itself so it can be uh uh either plastic or latex
uh rubber wood or titanium
and th for each of them you have uh cases where for example titanium
you can't use it for if you if we're choosing a double curved case we can't choose titanium
and if we are choosing um solar cells then we can't choose latex for the case material so we just have to take that into account
but if we're choosing just the flat case then we can go for anything
and i think we discussed earlier on the r. s. i. problem thing so we could uh
so that might be an idea of using the rubber but then it should you know yeah
yeah
let's have a squeezable remote
yeah
and also it doesn't break as easily maybe i dunno
when a t. v. programme's got one watching the match and your team's just lost
you can fuzz it across the room and it'll bounce off the wall back at you
yeah
yeah i like that idea
mm
so rubber would be
okay
i think rubber's
rubber we're all we're all going we're all liking that idea
you think you can market that
but after my after my fashion thing i think you'll realise that rubber is more
uh s so if d okay
ooh we like rubber ooh
people
and then there are the push buttons so you can have basic push buttons or a scroll wheels like you have on a mouse
um or you could have um l. c. d. which gives you a display
um scroll buttons as well
uh-huh
so if you use a rubber double curved case you must use rubber push buttons
so if we're going for rubber then we have to decide for the case
um and if we choose double curved then we have to go for rubber push buttons
so it's a constraint
well we're gonna go with i think we've decided that it's gonna be a rubber case so
yeah but is it a double curved one or not
if it's not a double curved then we've got the choice for the push buttons if it's a double curve we've gotta go for rubber push buttons
if that makes sense
push buttons instead of the wheel
yeah
if it's rubber isn't it malleable anyway it doesn't matter if it's double i mean isn't a rubber case
mean it's completely flexed i mean it it flexes to whatever they want it to
mean so what's the difference between a normal rubber case and a rubble doub double rubber double curved case
rubble double double
no but na le you see you've got okay the energy that's one thing
i'll have a big mac please
then you have the case is uh whether it's flat or curved
and that's we don't care if it's rub rubber or not but then we've decided that we going for rubber for the case material
so if we've chosen rub rubber and if now we have the choice for the case whether it's flat single curved or double curved
and i'm just saying if it if we choose it to be double curved then we need to go i dunno why
but we need to go for uh rubber push buttons
okay
so either
i dunno we just need to decide on the on the case
let's have rubber push buttons hey
okay
go rubber
go rubber the whole way
let's go crazy
and then do i have a last slide
yes i do
um so the push buttons themselves they can be just simple or they can be so that's just the electronics between the but behind the push buttons
yeah
um and the price that go with it with it so the simple push buttons are gonna be the cheapest
uh if we get a scroll wheel that's a higher price range
if we get an advanced chip which is um used for the l. c. d. the display thing then that's even more expensive
simple yeah
chip on print
it's a bit
okay uh what i'm not understanding here
mm
is uh okay advanced chip on print
which i presume is like one p. c. b. and that's got all the electronics on one board including the um infra red sender
yeah
the infra red
yeah
right
um what a what alternatives do we have to that
y um what alternatives do we have to the chip on print
well if if it's not chip on print then i guess you get different chip components and you build them separately and doesn't include the infra red
it's less expensive mm
so it sounds
technically speaking it's not as advanced but it does the job too
so why would we not go for that
if it's something that's inside the the unit
fo
it doesn't yeah yeah yeah
i it doesn't affects whether the customer's gonna buy it or not
totally
yeah
um we wanna go for an i i all so long as it works
so let's not go for the
yeah yeah
you know
i agree
so let's not let's uh not bother with the chip on print
so it's either um the scroll wheel or the push buttons
yeah
s yeah push buttons
what about the just developed uh sample sensor
i think push buttons is
what about what
g there the sample sensor sample speaker thing
well
well what do we need a speaker for in a remote control unit
mm i dunno
be cool
it'd be it'd be cool but they are saying they've just developed it i'm just guessing
channel two
yeah
but it's gonna be the most expensive option probably and
s
th the the speech recognition um option is it doesn't seem really very promising for us uh 'cause uh
yeah
it's not something that we wanna t go into with this product
the yeah the example that they're already using it for is with the coffee machine where basically you can program a sample wi um
that when you say something it will give a response and you program the response as well
just uh clips of tha that you record yourself
so you can program your coffee maker that when you say good morning to it it says hello rick or whatever
yeah
but i mean it's not it would be one thing if it was speech recognition where you say something and it turns the t. v. on like
hm
turn the t. v. on and i turns comes on but it's not that
it just gives you a it just gives you a verbal response
oh it just gives an answer
so yeah i mean like what's the point of saying hello remote i mean hello how how are you
oh then then
yeah
yeah
i thought i thought it was when they said
just if you are really lonely maybe
yeah if you're really lonely it is it's
i thought when they said voice recognition they meant um like channel five and it will change
channel five
and then it switches on
no tha that w that w that would be more promising
like you talk to it
can i have channel five
yeah
it it's just a remote that talks to you
uh
oh then forget about it
yeah
yeah
oh right okay
i mean to certain cues
yeah
okay so i'll go back maybe to the previous slide and we can decide for each problem what we should choose
so for the energy source do we go for the battery or the
'kay
yeah i'm fine with the basic battery
basic battery
mm
it's cheap it's cheerful it's worked does work
hmm
cheaper option
are you happy with that
mm
yeah
okay
so we'll go for the battery
then the case do you want it flat or curved or sing or double curved
we were go we were going with the late with the the r. s. i. rubber weren't we
yeah so we want it rub rubber double curved
the the
so it will look like something like this
double
the double whopper please
okay so then if we use double curved case then we have to u choose rubber push buttons and that's fine
yep but we're going for the simple buttons
so rubber rubber keys yeah
yeah
and it's cheapest all round it sounds kinda funky
and we can also market it as i 'cause we were s saying earl you were saying earlier in your research that um the the people have the r. people were getting the complaining about r. s. i.
p
yeah
and this is anti r. s. i.
yeah
yeah
so that's another marketing point that we can use
well the rubber push buttons
don't you have to move your
but anything is gonna have buttons
mm
even if it's a jog wheel it's still repetitive
i thought they would give an option of flat buttons or a
you
you see you can still get it does you still get repetitive strain injury whether you are pressing a button or pressing a flat bit of screen
that they don't
it's the v it's the fact that you are pressing the same doing the same movement
mm
it's not actually what you are doing
but the fact that this this rubber i is actually used in these anti r. s. i. ps specific
mm
yeah the rubber's good
yeah
we're giving them a way to burn off steam basically yeah
yeah
yeah so they can sit there and go like
not that watching t. v. should be that stressful
and you know yeah you can fuzz it across the room and throw it at throw it at your children yeah
oh yeah i guess t. v. can be stressful yeah if you're watching sports
alright that's me done
alright
okay gabriel
let's um let's let's hear from you about the um it's the interface
alright
yeah some of what i have to say ties into what catherine was just talking about
great
sorry
okay so i'm continuing with the user interface uh topic
and so basically i consulted with our manufacturing division
it sounded like catherine was also speaking with them
uh i also took uh reissa's marketing findings from the last meeting into consideration um
'cause i think that's that's crucial as far as uh what keys we're going to inc inclu what buttons we are going to include and and how they're laid out
mm
uh and so the manufacturing division uh sent some some samples of of uh interface components that we might be interested in using that have been used in other products
uh like the coffee machine
so i already mentioned the speech recognition interface
i guess we we basically vetoed that idea
it's it's pointless
mm
uh it's just a sample sensor sample output
it would just be probably the most expensive part of our remote without any actual interesting functionality as far as operating the t. v.
uh so yeah
they they also give the uh they they suggested the idea of using a spinning wheel like you use on the side of an m. p. three player like ipod
mm
mm
um so we've already addressed that and i think that would actually be worse for something like r. s. i. i mean you got that thumb movement that you're constantly doing
yeah
mm
that does get annoying
um the other suggestion and i i have a feeling that
we're interested in in something more general but they suggested uh you know going i a little bit into a a niche
like either gearing our remote towards kids where you could have lot of colours um
the keys might be you know funny or or or uh something for the elderly
mm-hmm
where the remote's very large and the buttons are very large and there's only a few buttons
but you know we can we can discuss this but it sounded like from our last meeting we really wanted something that was general but done well
uh um
yeah
so the key layout and design are really crucial
you don't want uh you want people to be able to quickly access the buttons that they use a lot without uh always pressing the wrong one um
and i didn't mention that we need a power button in our last i can give you an example here of uh good layout and bad layout
uh
from our manufacturing department
so this would be an example of bad layout
where you have volume up and volume down but they have a v. on both of them so uh
yeah
yeah
it's sort of confusing for the user
uh this is the example of the giant remote that's impossible to lose
do we have an uh example of a good one
brilliant
uh-huh
well
and for something for kids
yeah
um
yeah
and so
yeah i th i think my personal preferences of we've all kind of talked about and seemed to be on the same page um
uh so i was against the speech recognition and against going uh towards anything in in a niche sense
i think it should be more general
mm-hmm
i didn't i didn't think the spinning wheel or the uh l. c. display were were crucial for us
and yeah that's it for me
okay
well let's um so w what are our definite decisions on this then as a team
the um
the the um the interface type we're going for
so we're we're not gonna have any sort of display i think uh
just the simple s simple straight set of buttons
so yeah it's just gonna be just gonna be push buttons
um
i think we shall have a limited number of buttons ideally i mean a a power
yeah
channel up channel down volume up volume down and a numerical keypad
yeah
uh
and some sort of it will either have a a lock button like we mentioned or or a cover or something like that
yeah
i guess it's to the point where we need to decide about that
okay and we're not yeah
well now that we've decided on our
are we gonna hav hav an are we d have we decided on whether
w we're gonna s supplement it with anything you know colours or particular gimmicky bits to it we're not we're just gonna go for something
um it seems like we wouldn't wanna make it too busy and too sort of gaudy but um
we're
maybe we can
yeah i would say mayb maybe a couple of colours like uh like a black with with yellow and somewhere
like maybe the r. r. can be yellow or something like that
yeah
yeah
okay
okey dokey
yeah i don't have any other questions on this
let's move over to
i i guess the fact uh also that we are having a rubber case uh would prevent us from having the cover function that we thought of before
i mean 'cause uh s so if we wanna have a lock of some sort it would have to be a button
yeah sure
but i think that should be i mean um i can speak with the button department
but uh i think that it should be easy to have a button that just prevents prevents the other uh the other buttons from operating
yeah the button that just does that yeah
so that should be simple
cool
right
well i'm just basically letting you know what's happening in the markets
mm yeah
and what the fashions are for next year
um
so yes so from looking at this year's trends and fashions and also recent investigation that we've done in the remote control market
mm-hmm
we have found that for the remote control market these are like most important aspects like that we really need to which we've already probably discussed
um the most important aspect is look and feel
so the remote control has to look and feel fancier than the ones that already that we already have
so it has to be
yeah why should people buy this when they're already got a remote that came with the t. v.
yep
exactly
mm
yeah
um second uh it should be technologically innovative innovative
so
what's that mean
technologically it should be like um work basically i guess
it should work
well it should be it should be maybe cutting edge in some sense i mean have something that's little more technologically advanced than what's on the market
should
that's new
okay now the trouble is is we've already decided that we're going with the stuff that works already that's cheap
yeah
yeah
yeah
actually i mean these first two points we've already sort of gone away from
yeah
'cause our rubber one is not fancy i mean it's different but i wouldn't say like a rubber remote is fancy
mm
yeah
if that's what people want then we maybe we're going in the wrong direction
and it's it's not technologically innovative either
so no loose
maybe we could um
mm
that's why i was thinking bluetooth 'cause if you like put up bluetooth and it's like a bluetooth remote control
everybody's gonna like oh 'cause bluetooth is the in thing nowadays
like it really is like people and um when it comes to marketing like that's what people go for they don't really care whether you know
at the end of the day whether it works properly or not
of course they do
well they do but it's like it's not
one hundred per cent that's your first thing you go oh i'm not gonna buy that 'cause i dunno if it works or not
yeah but it looks good
if it looks good and it's it can just be there for decoration
okay well what do you two think about this
so is is the advantage of bluetooth that you can just like synchronise it with other
but like
electronics
yeah what i don't understand what m
you could always insert yeah
yeah that's basically what it allows you to do right
yeah and it this is just gonna all this is being used for is your television
yeah but i mean people like
it would that would mean you'd need a television that has bluetooth in it which no no television does does it
well if you're looking at if you looking at something that's going to be bought by people
well
you have to make it new you have to make it state of the art
that would mean we'd have to make a television as well
bluetooth would for example enable you i think to um um connect for example you if you get a w call on your mobile phone
but your mobile phone is downstairs or something you would get on your television you're being called by this person right now
things like that
no that would be your telephone in with your television
yeah the that wouldn't be the remote so much i mean
no i
yeah and i
no but if you get bluetooth on the remote you'd be able to
nah the televi the television would have to be a bluetooth compatible basically
i with the television yeah
i was just trying to find an advantage
mm
wha what w what advantage would you get for the
well it doesn't
an and there is no there is no such thing
like it doesn't have to be you know bluetooth that was just an idea
but like it needs do something that you know is new
whether it's a battery it could be something really
really minor you know like but i think we are really keeping to what is already out there
and people've already seen it people've already got it
okay
if we want something new we need to move away from what we already have
and um just go creative
maybe the kinetic mo provision of energy then
it's been done for watches but i haven't seen that for remotes yet
okay
yeah this that's that's very good
and then you can market it
never have to change a battery again
change the batteries ever again
and and this is all tying in very nicely
the fact that it's made out of this rubber we can throw it about
th we should encourage people to throw their remote controls about because it charges itself up by doing it
yeah well and in little characters you say yeah but not too much
yes so can
i think safety s
but yeah by the squeezing it the
yeah we can make the squeezing of the rubber be the be the generating like the energy generator
yeah that's a great idea
yeah
well done
third most important aspect uh is it's easy to use
we're all about that
and i think we've all um worked that out
um okay in the fashion how it's supposed to look
next year's fashion i very much in fruit and vegetables are thm are like the theme for cloths shoes and furniture
so next year people will be buying i found this really funny you know strawberry shaped chairs
okay so we could have keys that are like a b like a broccoli key and a uh and an avocado key on them
and things
yeah
yeah
rubber things
i wanna watch the pineapple channel
um and as it's rubber the feel which is in this year is spongy
so it's it's not quite spongy but spongy i would say is yeah so we're in
well spongy that's where
yeah we're we're ahead of the game there
yeah that's great for us
yeah
and so personal what i was just saying like move away from the current remote controls uh like the look and the feel of the current ones and change the look and feel
while still keeping to the company's image basically
so yeah
okay
i had to say
so we're moving in the right direction like
right
alright yeah no this i this is good so through all that we've we go we're right
yeah
we're gonna go go back to um going with the kinetic thing that's great
yep
yeah that's great
using the spongy rubber that we were talking about that anti r. s. i. you can as you squeeze it you are not only therapeuticising yourself
you are charging the batteries and um i'm not sure about the buttons being in the shape of fruit though
mm
no vegetables
yeah i don't know how we incorporate
we don't have to follow every trend i guess
maybe make it like fruity colours or something
some sort
uh-huh
or
the power button could be like a big apple or something
mm
well yeah but apple would sue you for that
yeah this is true
they don they don't own all images of apples
sued the beatles so
okay we'll make it a uh pomegranate a big pomegranate
well okay it seems like the only thing that we haven't really finally um agreed on is
its image
like yeah we're we're saying no we don't want it to be fruit and vegetables
but we dunno what it should be or like are we going yeah it looks slick
but what do what do we mean by slick sort of thing
well
i think if it's rubber
it needs to be
i mean you said earlier on i it should be funky
different
i think it's it should be i mean what do you associate with rubber
you know like
l keep it clean keep it clean
really different colours basically
okay sor i sorry i used the wrong word what do you associate with the mate the material that material
um um like i'm just thinking bright colours
yeah
bright natural colours nothing
too
bright but not too bright
bright but too not yeah
yeah
like no lime green or bright yellow or bright pink
wanna make it different colours so anybody can choo like like
like the volume buttons should be the all the same colour and the d and the the channel buttons should be one colour and stuff like that
mm
do you mean
yeah
and on the back of it have the logo
okay what
yeah
sure
why not
okay
the one thing i'm wondering about
tha
i hope that we're not going like too much down a gimmicky road of of having i mean if somebody go goes into the store they're gonna see like three or four normal remotes
yeah i mean we that's we we
and then a big spongy pink t tomato uh remote
yeah
this is the remote control tomato
i mean what are ninety per cent of people gonna take
well
i can say in this country you'll get you know lots of people wanting something really funky and cool
like and kids will be walking in with their parents saying mummy i wanna buy that one
and uh parents will see the will see the pro as well because it's um
like kids won't break it it's not breakable if you throw it around
yeah
especially with younger kids you know they can pick it up and and
yeah
the only thing is is that really small kids might chew on it but
well it's it's gotta be chew proof
yeah
so so it's rea it's quite it's quite like um user friendly and also for different families
i'm gonna write that down
like like family use as well so for little kids and for old ki like teenagers will like it i think
especially maybe younger girls if it's in pink they'll be like pink remote control for their room something
so what are you saying maybe we should market it in different colours for different so we could do like the pink range
yeah
that's yeah
mm
the blue range the green range the
so like you walk in you're like oh i like that remote control because it's so bright and then
and then the shop assistant comes up and says oh what colour would you like
and then they go like oh i can choose the colour wow
so it puts i think even the customer into more control over what they're buying instead of you've got all colour it's either that or nothing
so they also get to pick
well personally i like walking into a shop and choosing a colour
yeah i mean that that seems to work well with for products like ipod where you know you have a variety of colours
it's um
yeah
mm
that people feel like they're customising it when they buy it even you know just just by the fact of choosing
mm
d you've got the
although i'd be curious to see how many uh
you know there are some colours that i wouldn i would never choose and i would be curious how many people choose that colour
right
well that's that can be down to bit of market researching you know if that's easy enough to find out what colours are more popular
mm
yeah
and produce less of the silly colours maybe
mm
okay
alright
well um we'll alright let's what we're gonna aim to get together by the next meeting then um
is
from you catherine wi your y y you know you're gonna be working on the the look and feel design
yep
um gabriel you're gonna be working on you know come up with the the user interface design
then basically you two are gonna be working together on this
you won't be going off to your separate offices
alright
okay
um and i think you are gonna get a chance to play with some clay
oh right
i think yeah it's gonna you know come up ki you know
mm
be ab for the next meeting be able to come in and show us some some i some physical ideas
'cause at the moment uh you know it's it's hard
cool
yeah
we were kinda going yeah it's gotta feel nice it's gotta look cool and that it's you know now we can actually start
it is
you know s some sort of physical something or other
that sounds good
um and you're gonna be working on the product evaluation
evaluation
um
and i
will be uh
talking to the bosses basically and uh
f fielding off some more spam and
uh
great
that's it really
keeping things t well uh you know ho hopefully uh keeping things together
um
yeah that's
this is this is uh good
so we know for definite we know we've we've now got some definite things going on
we definitely know how it's powered we definitely know that um it's gonna be a simple buttons
mm
we're not gonna be going for the new technological chip on print expensive things so we've we're keeping the costs down
it's this rubber casing that we can sell as um fun and funky
don't know of any other remote controls that are made out of this stuff
mm
people you know people are saying oh standard stuff gives you repetitive strain injury
well this remote control is designed to do the complete opposite
yeah
it's supposed to fix it rather than cause it
um
you know we're gonna we we're gonna as a sort of extra something on it you know what what extra things are there extra things this product have
we'll look into this lock key
right
facility although whether or not it happens or is possible i don't know but something to look into
okay
i think that's um well done everybody
alright
anyone have any uh
any questions everyone know what they're doing
yeah
'cause if you don't you'll i'm sure you'll soon get an e mail about it
yeah
mm i think we all know what we need to do now
s
this gives you all the details
okay
okay
right well
it's um we're we've still couple of minutes until our meeting's due to finish
but um
i got a note saying that you two who are gonna be working together so bef before you all disappear off just
okay i'll stay in here
um
hold hold fire
um
does the pay raise immediately come into effect on our next pay check or is that
um i think it's uh yeah i think it's gonna be par part more of a profit sharing on the product
so we're buying fut i mean we're getting futures in the company
yeah i think i i think that's i think that's the way it's gonna happen at the moment
so we really have a incentive to make this remote work
yeah
yeah
i'd like to share in the coffee machine profits because that's really doing well
i want a share in the space rocket
did you see that this k that this company we've made a spaceship
yeah
yeah
this company has its its fingers in a lot of different pots
yeah
yeah
mm
yeah we're definitely not in the money making department
well i i did notice looking at i mean
they told you that they wanted whatev our product to represent the the r. r. brand and and to be immediately noticeable
yeah
i mean if you look like at the coffee maker at the at the corporate web page it's not obvious
mm
r. r.
well it is to us because we we worked worked here for years and we use that coffee machine
but it's doesn't have the colour scheme of of the of the company anywhere on it obviously it's just sil silver and black
mm
that's true
and the spaceship doesn't have the r. have a massive r. and r. down the side of it but i still want one
no
doesn't
mm
okay
um i've just had a sign flashing up saying finish the meeting
yeah
uh
okay
yeah
right well i guess that's us
yeah
it's not telling it's not saying do anything in particular just yet
so maybe you should go back to your own offices
okay
right
are we taking these off
yeah
yeah it says you two
it's play doh
play doh's edible
did you know that
it's definitely
because kids yeah
i used to eat it
i've i've definitely eaten it before
i didn't know was edible
yeah
but um it's it's made edible 'cause yeah
it's it's chew proof
it's made edible 'cause kids eat it and if it's wasn't edible then
yeah
well normal babies
actually that makes sense because i remember like
peopl i dunno if my mom ever did it but i remember other people's moms making like home made play doh where you just like make the colouring and make some sort of sort of dough
yeah
oh yeah it is yeah
oh yeah
right
mm-hmm
everybody everybody ready
yeah
yep
okay let's have your um let's get have the uh presentation
we've got some
we've got a cool prototype
yeah it's pretty exciting
so
everything uh that we wanted we wanted it to be ergonomic and to be made out of rubber very simple and easy to use yeah
double curved
nice
double curved um but also something that was gonna jump out at people
something that would be different uh separate it from the other remotes out on the market
so uh i think if you put this in the palm of your hand you'll see what a nice thing we have going here
that is cool
so basically
if you hold it like that the one on your thumb yeah the thumb button is the power button
mm-hmm
mm-hmm
your index finger is channel up middle finger is channel down ring finger is volume up your pinkie is volume down
what's the big blue thing
that's the lock button has a l. l. on it and then the m. is a mute button
oh cool
and then it also has digit
what button
um
and mute
for muting the uh
oh mute
um and then then you can also there's a numeric keypad on the top so you can key directly to the to the channel if you want
okay
so it's really basic functionalities as far as what keys are available but we think it's very comfortable and very innovative and it looks different
that certainly does
so all the i mean the important keys are right at your f f you know right at uh at a convenient place for you to to access them
mm
so you don't you
which is ant anti r. s. i.
yeah
mm
it should be
and it's also conformable to the size of your hand
i mean if that's too big it's a rubber remote so you can you know
yeah
's great
change that
oh it's so cute
so d does that uh what mesh with what you guys were hoping and for and expecting or does it
i have one thing about it but it's a small thing but it'd mean we'd have to make a right handed one and a left handed one
ah that's good thinking yeah
oh right yeah
but that's i don't see why that's not possible
yeah if we build rocket ships why can't we build left handed and right handed uh remotes
yeah
they make left handed scissors you know
yeah i didn't i didn't think about that but i'd yeah
yeah but then
but then you can learn to use your right h like i was just thinking if there's left handers and right handers in the family what they have two remotes
yes s
yeah
i know i know people who have left handed and right handed people in the family and they all use the computer for the whole the same computer the fes family and they have a mouse
mm
sure
sure
and everybody is using right handed mouse
yeah i'm sure they'll be able to
uh-huh
i mean it's only pressing buttons you don't have to do anything you know extraordinary
i think everybody can press a button with their left and right hand so
yeah
imagine d are you right handed
yeah
imagine you're doing it with your left hand i don't think it's too
yeah it's not
but we can have both uh
yeah
have them in stock
yeah
yeah
make 'em more appealing as well
but um other than that i mean uh and that's um you know
that's just something i think i think it's great yeah great idea
do you think it says r. r.
i think it does
i think it's well if the r. r. motto is we bring fashion to to electronics i'd say that could be quite fashionable
fashion to electronics
yeah
yeah
yeah
and it's got the b the black and yellow and blue
plus red which is sort of a a fruit and vegetable uh uh
yeah
yeah
there you go
so that's that's our end of things wha uh
that's
yeah very good yeah
it's come up with what we've you know the things that's what we've what we were looking at doing hasn't it all seems to be there
yeah
well done
and all the playing around is uh
um before we move on
yeah i'm just do you wanna plug in
i need that cable
okay
thank you
yeah
um
one thing i do need to do we need to look at is the costs
the costs was that what you said
play doh is very cheap
well yeah
mm
um
play doh won't last very long everybody'll go like oops it's gone
but it's edible
mm-hmm
mm-hmm
chew proof
well they'll buy more of them if you eat them
that was the main criteria from the last meeting it had to be chew proof
yeah
uh right
okay now i think we'll do this i could do you know i can do this o on my own or i could do it with you
yeah
oh ho ho
but it's just easy enough to go through it with you so we're going for the kinetic power
yep
and the electronics we decided on it being just a simple the easiest
thing that's inside it
ooh
so the case we've gone for the double curved
um
and it's made out of rubber
the interface is push buttons
and button supplements well they're in diff special colours aren't they
yeah
so special colours
yeah
it's better for
special form yeah they're a special form there in shapes and stuff
yeah i mean these these ones on the side are curved kind of so
and special material
yep
yeah
um
are they made out of any special material
rubber
no they're not
they're not made out of wood or titanium or rubber or anything they're just simple
well they're rubber aren't they
the buttons are rubber
okay
yeah
right
so let's see if that comes within budget
and it does
that is gonna cost uh yeah
we're under budget
that's gonna cost ten ten euro seventy cents a unit to make
and our target was it had to come in at under twelve fifty
that's cool
yeah
yeah
so
and we're actua actually making a better profit than we expected
this is all very very good
the bosses will be very pleased
okay let's just save this so i can e mail it to you
uh
save it in save it in the uh my documents
it's already saved i think
splendid
okay
so uh that's done with this with this um doodah so you're
gonna do what you were gonna do
thank you
mm
your evaluation
oh yeah
this is where we all get to i get to write on the oops on the board
right
oh
's function
f. eight
okay
i love the smell of that play doh
yeah have some have some
mm
i cou
okay
so evaluation
we're gonna do it all together so we evaluate each criteria
i've got the criterias
and we have to do it on a scale of one to seven one being true
so it's it's more like it's fits the criteria and seven being as in it doesn't fit the criteria
and the criterias are and i'll draw this up on the board so we have a box
and this is false this is just like
to keep you informed
so seven's here and one's here and then you've got in the middle
so the first criteria
do you all get what we're doing
mm-hmm
mm-hmm
okay cool
okay first criteria look and feel
so the does remote look and feel fashionable to what we talked about
as it is it colour wise and is it spongy
so what mark should we give for that
mm
i would give it a seven
yeah
as in it's not
oh sorry one
oh sorry one d yeah
a one
a one a one
so i'll just write criteria criteria one we get one
second criteria new technology
have we implemented new technology
as in the new high tech
well the kinetic thing yeah
yeah
yeah
that was our main technological innovation w every everything else was fairly simple but the fact that we used the kinetic energy was new
so it's
so we'll give it a
well so the um
it's ergonomic but that's not that's that's a design that's a des that's a design thing yeah
yeah
yeah but that's not a technological thing that's another thing i that's another marketing thing
yeah
yeah
true
yeah
so on the technical side of it it
i'd say it's about a a twoish
it's about in the mid in the middle somewhere maybe yeah i dunno
two
two
three
yeah
maybe three yeah
three
so criteria three is is it easy to use
easy to use
i think it's a one i think
i'd say it's i wouldn't not if you're left handed it's not
yeah
i would give it a i would give it a two
mm
two so it's
'cause i i it i it i it is more geared for right handed people than left handed people but
okay
but if we make a right handed and a left handed then
mm
if we're gonna have one left handed and one right handed then i would give it a one but otherwise otherwise a two
yeah
yeah
yeah
give it a t give it a two
yeah okay
'kay criteria four is costs
cost
it's come in under budget
's great
yeah
so that's a definite one
that was great
yeah
amount of buttons
like the amount of buttons 'cause people like a lot le like
contains only the necessary buttons
so it's a one
yeah
yeah
yeah
um criteria six
r. s. i. is it good against
yes s yeah
yes
so it's anti r. s. i.
very good
it's one
and criteria seven which is the last one does it get lost
is it easy to get lost
it's yellow
it is very bright yeah
i don't think it's gonna get lost easily
no
but it is smallish
it's not the kinda thing that's gonna slip like between a couch cushion or something you know
two
maybe it will
uh
t
mm
i think i it would could be could get lost
you think it could lost
two
mm
yeah
mm
i mean it's not fully it's not fully like you can't say i mean it's not a one definitely
i mean it
no i mean
i mean you could still flush it down the toilet theoretically but
okay
yeah anything i mean
okay
it's bigger than the average mobile i guess
yeah
but yeah it can get lost
the mobiles get lost all the time
yeah
okay yeah two is fine
but then you ring 'em and you find them
mm
yeah yeah
mm
so
okay
yeah
so that's that
so that's the evaluation so i'd say
yay
we've we've done well
alright it's all all systems go
it's like like a number one
yeah
um
number one product
mm
we can't fail
all done thanks
we fitted all the criterias
yeah
yeah so
well done reissa
so that's that one
okay i i think um i just wanna put in as project manager the you know
little bit of praise for everybody here for how they've worked on it you know both individually and as a team
you know you've w everyone's come up with their own individual ideas in their own different departments um and then come together and worked in
you know integrally you know at the right times psp you know especially you two
that's all you know gone very very well and and and be you know has been good communication going on
yeah
yeah during our design i mean there was some s some heated heated discussion but we we kept we tried to keep it cool and and
did you have to go down to the the corporate squash court and bash a few balls about
just just
we just had to we just had to squeeze our product a little bit and
well
you know
fantastic
now you guys have been a a great team
it is
think we're the we're the envy of all the of all the other r. r. teams
been cool
i think so i i you know and i think we've co we have come we've come up with something new
something that hasn't been done before we haven't we're not just rehashing an old design
in four diff in in four meetings
yeah
funny all designer meetings could be this quick
you know maybe this isn't a simulation maybe this is actually so it's like sony or someone like that they're they're just yeah they get
yeah i think they're actually trying to find ideas for a ideal remote
they're using our ideas
yeah
yeah two years' time this will be on the market
ex exactly that product um thum we'll go yeah we designed that and no one will believe us
but um
so at this stage i mean is this the last meeting of the project
we don't uh have another one after it's gone gone to marke market or something
yeah
no i think when this meeting's finished like officially there b we'll get a uh questionnaire to fill in
y
oh really
or six uh
just start summarising now
you can reply to the same message
i haven't got message
see summary there
if you just reply to that one
so there's no way to like predict what our 'cause we had a we originally had a
as far as our financial uh um goals we had a specific number for profits that we wanted
it was fifty mil fifty million
was it was it fifty or five
i don't remember
but there's not a way to compute that i mean since we saved on the on the production cost
do we know how much we're making on profit
it gets handed over to another department
depends how much we sell
uh
what our what our project was was to come up with the product basically
hmm
the for the and just basically is it it come can is it within budget
when it c when it comes to all the other things of how to sell it and you know
the b the profits and all that that's other departments it's another team that actually work out the mai the oh yeah
but we have a vested interest prof profit sharing
the all the guys in the profit sharing yeah
um
yeah that's it
you know we've we've we've made i we've made we've designed the product we've ma we've got the prototype
we finished an hour earlier
it's within budget it's does everything that we wanted it to do
it's new it's it's um
something that uh that isn't out there already
i think actually and one advantage of of this is that after the uh you know
after this fad of fruit and vegetables passes this will still be c a cool remote you know
mm
we're not we're not you know tying tying our cart to that one horse
yeah
mm
well this is very marketable in that it is it's it's something that's kind of new and looks a bit quirky for people who want that
definitely
it's that it's um hang on i wrote it down here somewhere
oh no i thi i put it in one of my e mails that i sent off
um that you know it's marketable in the sense that it's whilst all these other remotes uh actually do give you repetitive strain injury
our one does the complete opposite you know so that's something that's new
mm
mm
which is one of the criteria they asked us to come up with something with something new
mm
it make watching t. v. healthy
yeah and if you're not having a good time with the t. v. you can f throw it about you know
yeah
it's fine it's kid proof
just don't sh don't throw it at any of the ornaments and break them
uh
well you can break the ornaments but you won't break that
no
yeah
so all in all i think we've done very well
mm yep
well done everybody
yay
right you too
um
drinks are on the company
cool
in the corporate bar that's next to the corporate swimming pool on the top floor that we're that've all just gained access to
mm
glad to hear that
yeah
that's it
that's it
well as far as i t as far as i know
um
yep
we haven't got the five minute left thing yet
no
anyone wanna play i spy
mm mm
i guess it's probably better that we wrap it up than have five minutes of
silence
should we call the day then
yeah i guess
i mean we're gonna get asked to fill out another questionnaire
uh right
um
it's probably gonna be the same as one we've done before
mm-hmm
in project
but i'm not the authority to say that it is
um how does everyone feel about the technology that's been used in this
the sort of using of the the pens and writing on these special pads and all that
i love it
i love it
i think it's cool
being all wired up and a vibrating pen and it's cool
being watched
um
your moment to shine
wow
yeah
i thi you know i'd i'd n yeah as we said earlier i've not never seen that before
something that t the whiteboard
yeah
thingy that's great
um but a p a pen with a camera on it i don't think it's such a new thing
i mean it's i or in such a new idea
it would be different if it was sort of hand writing recognition stuff
yeah
but as it's not it's literally that'll come up on a computer screen as a picture file rather than actual text
mm
right i think they do want to do hand writing recognition on that it's just the first step
yeah
yeah
mm
logitech
i guess we should end this since we're off off topic
yeah
so
shall we
meeting adjourned
right
yeah
hmm
okay
good morning everybody
um i'm glad you could all come
i'm really excited to start this team
um i'm just gonna have a little powerpoint presentation for us for our kick off meeting
my name is rose lindgren
i i'll be the project manager
um our agenda today is we are gonna do a little opening and then i'm gonna talk a little bit about the project
then we'll move into acquaintance such as getting to know each other a little bit including a tool training exercise
and then we'll move into the project plan do a little discussion and close since we only have twenty five minutes
first of all our project aim
um we are creating a new remote control which we have three goals about it needs to be original trendy and user friendly
i'm hoping that we can all work together to achieve all three of those
um so we're gonna divide us up into three compa three parts
first the functional design which will be uh first we'll do individual work come into a meeting the conceptional design
individual work and a meeting and then the detailed design individual work and a meeting
so that we'll each be doing our own ideas and then coming together and um collaborating
okay we're gonna get to know each other a little bit
so um what we're gonna do is start off with um let's start off with amina
um alima sorry alima
alima
um we're gonna do a little tool training so we are gonna work with that whiteboard behind you
um introduce yourself um say one thing about yourself and then draw your favourite animal and tell us about it
okay
um i don't know which one of these i have to bring with me
probably both
right so i'm supposed to draw my favourite animal
i have no drawing skills whatsoever
but uh let's see introduce myself
my name is alima bucciantini
um i'm from the state of maine in the us
i'm doing nationalism studies
blah blah blah and i have no artistic talents
how do you spell your name
a. l. i. m. a.
thanks
oh and i guess i'm the industrial designer on this project
so let's see if i can get um here
i will draw a little turtle for you all
not necessarily 'cause it's my absolute favourite animal but just that i think they're drawable
and you have the pretty little shell going on
some little eyes
happy
there you go
that's a turtle
yes
so what are your favourite characteristics
um
i i like the whole having a shell thing
mm
it's quite cool carry your home around where you go um quite decorative little animals they can swim
they can they're very adaptable they carry everything they need with them um and they're easy to draw
excellent
shall we just go around the table
uh okay
well my name is iain uh
mm
and i'm the user interface designer for the project
um
and
i'll try and draw my favourite animal
no you can erase the turtle it's alright
i'll i should leave that one on there shouldn't i before i callously rub it off
might be nice to have them all up there at same time
um i'm not gonna draw it quite to scale um
is that at least identifiable
snake
well
it's a whale yes
em
well snake
it's w
thanks
oh my god it's better than what i'm gonna be able to do
um and yeah the reason i like whales is 'cause uh they're well first of all they're quite intelligent um and also they're they're kind of mysterious
like we don't really know much about them or or understand how they work how they form groups
and i just find them interesting animals
take my contraptions with me
alright i'm jessy
i'm from around d. c. ish sort of in the u. s.
and we're gonna keep the deep sea sort of theme going on animal
don't really know how to draw this
just where can i
mm
mm
maybe if i do the water but how
sort of give an idea
i have no idea how one would explain this
mm maybe with some whiskers
briefly it's supposed to be a seal
you can imagine it in the water
i like them because they are like playful and silly sort of have a good time
not gonna try and pretend like i can get any better than that
mm 'kay
mm 'kay
i'm rose and i'm project manager from california
um
hmm
s
oh a cat
it's definitely significantly harder once you are doing it
yeah
um it's actually a coyote
let's see
right
that's impressive
let's see let's give it a little bit of a snout i don't know some teeth
that's
yeah
that's pretty impressive
cool
oh dear
yes
i live um i live right across the street from an open space in california
we have coyotes howl all the time
so i really enjoy their their singing you they're really beautiful animals
mm
okay um moving on to
slightly more serious stuff
we're gonna talk about project finances
um we have a couple we'd like to sell it for about twenty five euro with the profit aim of um fifteen million euro um from our sales and because this is such this is for television it's a we have a market range of internet
like it's an international market range we don't have to worry about specifics
um in order to make a profit of this magnitude we need to um be able to produce each one at a maximum of twelve fifty euro
so we're selling it for twice what we'd like to produce it for
okay um just to generate a little bit of discussion about the project um i could i'd like to hear about your experiences using ro remote controls
um your first ideas about um creating a new r remote control
what would be the best um like you what are the features that you really like what are the features that you don't like etcetera so
um i hate when there's like four different buttons and you have to press to actually turn on the t. v. like you have to do one for the power of the t. v. and then like another one to get the actual screen on and something else to get it all going
i don't know
now they keep combining all different remotes together and i don't know if i necessarily like that 'cause i feel like you end up with multimedia overload
i just wanna watch the t. v. um
hmm
always gets lost
some sort of like
device to help you find it
i've used i've used remote controls for things like t. v. and the c. d. player and video recorder and
i i guess they're they're pretty neat neat little tools uh
you don't have to get up and walk across the room to change a channel
mm
so especially if you're someone really lazy like me they they're pretty nice
um
i find them they can be a bit annoying especially
like you know if i'm watching t. v. i have have to have three separate remote controls of in front of me
you know one for the t. v. one for the digital box one for m the video recorder as well
um
and also they tend to they tend to be a bit confusing
they've got too many buttons on them uh too too sort of too sort of complicated when all i really wanna do is switch on and off
change the channel change the volume
yeah um
i agree with having too many remotes around
my dad has a whole drawer at home of remotes for various things and i don't know how to work half of them um
what's important for me i guess is that it's easy to use and that there's not too many buttons
they are not too small you know you know you need to n to know what you're doing
and one thing i particularly like is if you are not um sort of moving it around to get it to work with the infra red
yeah
yeah
um i think there is a way around that
but i know in my residence right now the the television you sort of have to walk all around the room to get it to turn on
mm-hmm
so i it's just simpler just to just turn around the t. v. itself
and i think that's if we're gonna make a remote control it should actually work for what it's doing
so
what about like batteries and things like that like are there some remotes that don don't require
like batteries or do all remotes require batteries
um i would imagine all of them
i know
but we could but it's possible we could use like a lithium battery um that would last a lot longer than like double a. s
yeah something that doesn't
mm-hmm
um like tho those are the batteries that are used in a lot of um m. p. three players now and that kind of thing
mm-hmm
um
mm
um
okay it seems we have a little bit of a conflict over um to uh combining all the remotes cont together versus having f five different remotes
so um like you said you don't like having all the buttons on one on one remote and yet you don't wanna have five remotes
so how do we work with that
yeah
mm
could we get something that
just has
no doesn't have all the buttons that you need to program the video recorder or program s other things that i'm not very coherent about
but that just has your major buttons for that work for everything you know volume control on off
mm-hmm
channel changing
and maybe that spatially divides it so it's like if you're looki if you're trying to get the t. v. on that's you know
like the top thing on the remote i dunno if d be vertical or horizontal in terms of how we're gonna make it
yeah
but if it's like all the t. v. stuff was here then all the v. c. r. stuff was here
all the whatever else we have programmed into it it's all just in its separate place and not like all the on buttons together
mm
n that way
yeah
'cause then you like i don't even know what i'm turning on
yeah and if um if you'd save the more complicated functions maybe for separate remotes that you wouldn't need to use every day
mm
mm-hmm
okay so maybe have like one remote that has the main functions on off
um
channel changing volume and another rote remote with all the special things
because that is one thing that um remotes tend to have buttons that the t. v. s no longer have as well
yeah
mm
so like you have to have them somewhere 'cause you're gonna m need those special functions occasionally
yeah
right
um but not necessarily on the m the normal remote
can i ask are we designing a remote control for a television only um and if if this device is just to be used for the television
good question
would we even technically be possible to include video recorder functions on it
i don't know that yet
um or should we just stick to just stick to having television television related buttons on it
mm
it's a good question
um
i'll look into that
mm-hmm hmm
if i can
i think it's just t. v. i mean if it if we're taking it just new product a new television remote control that's not like doesn't say
mm yeah
you know things might be more advanced than that
mm
so we should maybe we should assume that i t it's just a television that we're wanting to control
well
i mean i suppose it would be nice to have playing and record and stop buttons on it for the video recorder as well i i don't know if that works technologically or not
yes
i guess we have to define what what we're aiming for
if it's just a television then that it's a bit simpler 'cause there's less buttons that would even need to be on it
yeah
it's an idea with the buttons being really
large
yeah
if you have older people or people like me that aren't very co ordinated hand eye
it's really quite important that you are not pressing a small like teeny mobiles phone size buttons if we can help it
mm
yeah
okay
'kay sounds like we've had a good little discussion for our first ideas
mind if we move on
ps mm okay
'kay
mm-hmm
um now our next meeting starts in thirty minutes
i believe we've actually been only working on this this one for about twenty so we can continue discussing more new ideas if you'd like um
hmm
but this is just a breakdown of what we'll be doing individually
um the industrial design alima will be doing um the working design
yeah
um the user interface designer that's for
technical functions i guess like keeping in mind the buttons thing the size of the buttons
um user requirements um so you'll be hearing about different trends uh about different things that people need
um i guess kind of the same uh discussion that we've been having we'll get from the actual consum s consumers
mm-hmm
mm 'kay um
and you will get specific instructions sent by your personal coach
i realised in this past one we we didn't have much we just wanted to get a little brain storming done
um so very exited to see all your animals and how what wonderful um artists we all are um
any questions
what we're gonna be discussing at the next meeting
do we know that
i haven't gotten an agenda yet um i'll put that together
i'm sure as we'll each get our own instruction and then um because what we gonna do is first our individual actions and then we'll come back together
right
yep
so i'm sure we'll all have more concrete things to contribute next time
'kay
yep
i'm sure we'll be busy
mm 'kay um i'll type up mi minutes and probably email those out to all of you
okay
um just including all the things that we talked about
can you e mail your slides as well
um
is that possible
yes i yes i think i can
mm-hmm
cool
i'll just attach it to an email
and you're you're number two three four
i'm two
i'm four
is that correct
okay
alright
excellent
it was lovely meeting you all
'kay
just make sure you keep checking the company web site and the emails
'kay
let me see if i can do that right now
good to see you all again
let's see if that comes up
this is our functional design meeting
um
just a sec while my powerpoint comes up
et voila
okay
mm um we put the fashion in electronics
let's start
okay our agenda today um just check the time it's twelve thirteen
um
i'm gonna do an opening talk about um did you all get the minutes
i e mailed them to you
i'm also putting 'em them in the shared folder
yep
so um then i we'll talk about our general objectives and have your three presentations
right
um i'll talk about the new project requirements i've just received and then we have to make a decision on our remote control functions
finally we'll just close
we're starting this meeting at approximately twelve thirteen and we have forty minutes
so
first of all the functional design objectives
uh we need to keep in mind the user requirement specification what needs and desires are to be fulfilled
the functions design what effects the apparatus should have and the working design how the apparatus actually works to fulfil its function
okay three presentations um you can go in any order you choose um
mm shall we go in the order that you just did it
sure please do
i dunno
how do i hook my screen up
i think you might have to disconnect rose
yes i do
yeah
well there's a wee a wee plug just just that one there
where does it go
mm-hmm
hmm i'm not supposed to move this but
ah that's it yep
and then you have to press function f. eight i think it is on your laptop
function f. eight yeah
where's function
the blue one f. n.
no signal
is it plugged in all the way and you screwed it in and
ah wait 's screw in
yeah
i i think you just have to push it in really hard
push the screw
that's it
oh got it
mm 'kay
mm alright
it's taking it a little bit
i've never attached to anything
mm neither have i
'kay there you go
alright so i don't know if you guys are able to get access to um the report that was online or if i'm the only one who is
alright
but i don't even know how to play this
no
press the little presentation
it's the um it looks like a y. kind of over there above draw
there that one there you go
alright
so we're just gonna talk a little bit about the functional requirements that people specified when they were asked
um i guess real reaction did some market research
they had a hundred subjects and their usability lab and they watched them watch t. v. and recorded the frequency that they used particular buttons and the relevance that those buttons had
what they found was they analysed people's desires and needs
focusing on their desires um people specifically said that they thought remotes were ugly
seventy five per cent of the a hundred subjects noted that and that they more importantly though
eighty per cent said that they would be willing to pay more for a fancier looking remote
i don't know anything beyond what fancy means but that's particularly of use to us i think
hmm
um also they did some questions on voice recognition and found that the desire for voice recognition was inversely related to age
so younger people were more inclined to want something with voice recognition
whereas the older people in the like sixty and above segment or so did not really think that they would pay more money for voice recognitions
um people also had certain frustrations that i think that we could try to take into consideration with
'kay
our design
that being people k um frustrated with losing their remotes
i think over fifty percent of the people mentioned that that was their biggest frustration
people are also frustrated with the difficulty it is to learn how to use a remote and i think that ties back to what you were saying before just that there's too many buttons
hmm
it just needs to be easy to use
it also mentioned something called r. s. i. and i was hoping someone might be able to inform me as to what r. s. i. is because i don't know
repetitive strain injury
what
repetitive strain injury
ah
there we go
wow
so if you
people do not like that
so i guess sort of the carpal tunnel type thing people do not like that um the repetitive use i guess caused a strain
um looking at the needs people specified the problem right now is that people's remotes are not matching their operating behaviour
people are only using ten per cent of the buttons that they have offered to them on their remote
and what people do most often is changing the channel and changing the volume
people also zap like to change the channel about um sixty five per cent during an hour of use
so we really just need to focus in on those volumes and channel changers rather than things like the audio settings
the screen settings and the channel settings because they're used much more infrequently and probably just complicate what's going on
so i think that some things that we might wanna think about the idea of an l. c. d. screen was brought up although they didn't have any details on
what people's preferences on that were so i dunno know if that's coming to me later or something like that
but something for us to consider also just the phenomenon that less is more when it comes to the buttons on the remote or what we wanna make easiest to use
make sure that
you know something like an audio setting isn't given as much importance and visibility on the remote as something like channel changing that's used a lot more often
and basically in order for us to win over to the consumer we just need to focus on what it looks like
that it has a fancy appeal and that it's not ugly and that it feels like the way they're gonna use it
so it doesn't give them any hand injuries or things like that
hmm
thank you very much
that was that was great
mm 'kay
um 's move on to the next presentation um on effects
was that you
hmm
great
yeah have i unscrewed it
push
user interface right
interface
here we go
cheers
mm-hmm
and i think that's in the shared if i did it right if anyone wants to look at it
mm 'kay thank you
okay great
okay
here we go
right so i'm gonna talk about the technical technical functions design of the remote control um
we need to start by considering what a remote control actually is
it's a device that allows us to produce certain effects on our television so i it's basically a communication device
we we tell the remote control what we want to do it sends a message to the television saying change the channel
change the volume uh yeah adjust these settings adjust the brightness
um how do we actually go about designing a new television remote control
first thing to do is to come up with the design specifications
we need to know what our final product is gonna be like so we need a a clear idea of exactly what this product does
uh how it works and what the end user is gonna want from this product
um
oh a way i'd suggest that we could go about this is by designing uh several different prototypes of user interfaces for this product
um and then uh trying to get some feedback uh about
h how well these particular prototypes work uh sorta find out what people think of 'em
um using a remote control is is quite a subjective experience
um
hmm
and different different people sort of prefer different things
um we should remember that remote controls are a a fairly standard piece of equipment
when a users using a remote control he or she expects the buttons to be in certain places
so in some sense we're gonna we're gonna have to aim for a device which is fairly conventional in design uh so that we're not completely shocking people
but i think within that there is also room for us to introduce novel ideas uh and to make something that's that's perhaps a little bit different
something that stands out
um also in in designing the user interface we need to consider practicalities
uh the first of these is is technological ye uh what can we do with the current state of technology as it is
the second is is economic uh we need to find a balance between features and price
so as you mentioned things like voice recognition would would add to the price uh but it would also im improve the design of the product
hmm
so i had a look on the on the web uh to see if i could find a few examples of existing television remote controls
in analysing these we can consider what what things what's good about them
uh what things do they get right what's bad about them what's wrong with 'em
um how we can improve on the designs that that that i found and what can we do to make our product stand out from from the large majority of remote controls
here's two examples uh probably at the extreme ends of the spectrum
um on the left here we've got uh an engineering based design for a remote control so it's one that's got lots of buttons
it's it's fully featured everything you might possibly want to do is there you know it's got forward
backwards up down channel numbers volume uh freeze frame
yeah it's it's fully featured and it might take a while to get to learn to use it
but once you've learned it you can you can do whatever you want with your t. v.
the one on the right is a lot more basic
it's just got the essential functions of the t. v. changing the channel play stop volume
it would be a lot quicker to learn to use it but again th it's it's swings and roundabouts
there are disadvantages you can't use it say to to freeze the television picture
uh there's a lot of features that are missing from that remote control
so we've got to to find our find a way of striking a balance between the two
um as i said before remote controls are subjective different people want want different things
um personally wa what i want from a remote control is a device that's simple
it it's easy to use uh it's got big buttons for doing the things i do most often changing the volume changing the channel
it it does everything that i need it to uh as i said before
i'm quite lazy i don't wanna walk across the room just to adjust my television
i also want something that that looks cool um and that that feels good that's ergonomically designed
mm 'kay
thank you very much
that was very useful
it's funny to see the drastic difference between those two remotes
hmm
um
and neither of them were very pretty you know
no
yeah
i think that could be our selling point
mm
a fashion fashion remote
i think there's there's certainly a market for technology that looks cool
right
mm
mm-hmm
and i think that's that's why companies like apple've 've 've made a lot of progress
hmm
yeah
right i really can't see what i'm doing so does anyone have a
you there it is
ah ha look at that showing up already
lovely
so wait did it let you go on the internet or was that just what it let you see
uh that was just on the d on the company web site yeah
okay
'cause i was like googling and then i'm like wait it won't let me google
hmm
yeah
alright um
no how do i play again
um the it's right above draw
there are three thingy if it's way at the bottom
ah
under three icons and it's the one that looks like a desk
yeah that one
there are y. s
okay
so this is our working design presentation
um i had a bit of some issues with this because i wasn't able to find everything i needed but i guess that's we're still in early stages
um so yeah this is this
though th the thing about working design is the what we're trying to do as a working design is figure out how the aparata apparatus can fulfil its function
um one of the examples that kept coming up for me is that a coffee grinder
it works because it converts electrical energy to grinding the beans and then you put the bean through a filter and that filters out
and then you get coffee at the end that's nice and hot because of the combination of electrical energy and then the other things that are brought in to make it work
don't know if i'm explaining that very well but how do i get to the next s ah
so h the method as um working designers figure out what you need to make it fulfil this practical function
what what needs to be done and how do we convert all the elements to make that done
so wha the easiest thing to do is to break down all the points
at which you need something to happen
so you make a schematic of the way that the the energy is converted
tsh towards this practical function
and then i think the easiest thing to do is gonna be work on each task separately
so um
uh
you just press yeah just click
uh
that'll be fine
so the findings that i got uh very just very briefly is that you have a choice of the way that the information is projected to the receiver and in my opinion infra red is the best way to do that 'cause you don't need a sight line
so that's one thing we're gonna work on
um the user interface is critical here
because a lot of the things that happen in a remote control happen through the chip that controls that converts the electrical energy into data
which then goes through the infra red so the the chip that uh i think ian is designing is gonna be crucial
and really it all comes down to the to the user because they're the one that's controlling most of the working design
so the components that we find here are the energy source you know the battery or whatever that's gonna m make it work then the chip
which converts the data the user that's controlling the chip and the infra red bulb that's gonna let us move the data to the receiver
so you have four main components and they are designed sort of like this
you have your energy source right there which then um brings
uh energy or information to the chip which is also controlled by the users
you have energy going to the user who's controlling the chip ooh 's not what i wanted to do uh uh
um yeah use that thing you can go back previous
previous
sorry about that guys
pardon
oh
oh well
no no no no no
okay
okay let's just get back to my schematic here
ye
double click on it
with the right with the left hand one
w yeah yeah
i think it's frozen
here
don't show me that tip again
there we are
there we are
sorry about this guys
i'm kind of pathetic with things like this
um alright
so you have your energy source your user interface who's controlling the chip the chip also uses the energy
and the chip through the use of the user interface is gonna control the switch which will work your infra red bulb
which will then bring the data to the receiver
so hopefully that makes sense for everyone in my kind of garbled way
this is the the parts of the working design that need to be figured out
mm-hmm
and personal preferences besides the fact that i can't spell we need a long lasting energy source people don't wanna be changing it a lot
we need a chip that works well with the user interface that isn't too complicated
we need a straightforward interface like ian was saying simple not overwhelming it with information and we need a reliable and clear infra red signal
so that you're not waving your remote around and having to get frustrated and go do it by hands
mm-hmm
so that's pretty much it for the working design
excellent
so um
rose do you think you can give me a hand with this
yes absolutely
ah i can never tell which way to turn these things
yeah
lefty loosey righty tighty right
yeah
what's up
lefty loosey
lefty loosey righty tighty
uh
never heard that before that's good
oh yes
i'll think of that every time now
it's gonna stick in your head
yeah that's a good one it'll stick with you
mm 'kay
um i have nothing on my screen
just a sec
mm
here we are
ooh no signal
okay yeah it's fine
okay requirements
we have a couple new requirements that i was just e mailed right before the meeting and that we have to keep in in um in mind as we're creating this
okay
we didn't bring it up yet or at all in the meetings so far
but we're not gonna work with teletext because um well it that's been taken over by the internet
so we're not gonna worry about um we're not gonna worry about that
what's teletext
um
uh it's a british thing
oh
you don't have it in the states
oh so
no
it no
w d could would you care to explain it
oh i didn't realise
um yeah it's like a
i suppose it's kind of similar to a very very basic web browser
um you have like you have uh numbers on your remote control uh y and you type in the page number you want
mm-hmm
so like you type a hundred on your remote control and this this kind of index appears on the television screen with just some some text and some very blocky looking graphics on it
and you just type numbers to go to different pages and it gives you information
mostly rather boring stuff like what's on t. v. next and share prices and that kind of thing
s
lottery numbers and sport scores
yep news headlines
but if you ever see the t. v. saying like go to page one sixty on ceefax now that's what they're talking about
how
oh
it's earl it's pretty old technology
it's like nineteen eighties
okay
that explains a lot
i have no idea why we don't have it but
that's good
interesting
okay um well we're not gonna the management has decided we're not gonna work with that
um
okay um and we're also gonna w like your question earlier um whether this is going to be t for television video or etcetera
just for television
that's what we're focused on
right
um otherwise becomes to complex we wanna get this out um very quickly
we only have a a short amount of time
'kay
um and finally there's more marketing i think um our corporate image has to be recognisable
so while we're gonna make it look pretty we need to use our colour and our slogan i in the new design
mm
so what's our corporate image like
it's it's kind of yellow colour with uh we put fashion in electronics
looks like yeah kind of a yellow and black and we have that the emphasis on the r. s in um mm-hmm
it's like double r.
yeah
but it's yeah we put the um
fashion in electronics
so we gotta keep that in that in mind
okay so we want something that looks good
yep
yep
and is yellow
yeah or ha maybe some buttons could be yellow
okay
like we can we can play around with it a little bit
um
okay we need to talk about our functions and our target group
we need to decide who our target group is
you um in your analysis of different market um of the marketing you identified that different groups wanted different things or had certain preferences
mm-hmm
for example that um that older people didn't really care for um voice recognition but younger people did
mm-hmm
um and so who are we aiming this at
well if we're gonna say that function um fashion we put the fashion in in electronics then you automatically
i think a sort of younger group that that's who's gonna be attracted to this
yes i do think who's gonna have the money to buy that also that one
mm-hmm
it's gonna be twenty five euro remember so um it has to be avai marketable to um whomever it is
mm-hmm
is it is it something that's gonna be sold separately from the television or is it something that comes w with a television
'cause that would affect the way that we market it
well at least right now what we're doing is um deciding on just the remote itself so it will probably be sold separately twenty five euro by itself
right
right okay
the only break down that i was given in terms of age was the voice activation and basically there's a big jump
after thirty five people don't really care if it has voice so it's like basically fifteen to thirty five that think that that's a good idea
mm-hmm
i dunno i'm gonna be given any other numbers broken down in terms of age later
but if that's sort of the only quality that we have that is divided into age then we would wanna stick between the fifteen and thirty five range
yeah that's probably uh a population w quite a little bit of disposable income for use on technology anyway
so that might be a fairly good target group for us
yeah
now those are that's all specific for speech recognition
are we gonna use that as one of our functions
um
mm
i i would say no because it's gonna add too much to the price
especially if we are marketing it as a separate product people are gonna be paying uh
mm-hmm
well uh we've got a price limit of was it twelve twelve and a half euros for to produce it
mm
to produce it yeah
to produce it yes
and i wonder if we can get voice recognition into that twelve and a half euros without having to make too many other compromises
mm
but what else are we gonna put i mean not that i'm really gung ho about it
i don't know what else you can put in a remote to make it technologically advanced though
so like other than just making it look good
yeah
hmm
how is it i mean it can look really great and still have the same up n down buttons and why's anyone gonna buy a new remote
but right
well but why are we why are we aiming for a technological advancement
everything we're talking about is ease of use and simple and that doesn't necessarily mean more technology in fact it could use it could mean not
mm-hmm
that's a good thing to keep in mind
if they might be overwhelmed with with remotes that have too many buttons and too much technology
if someone's looking to buy a new remote don't they want like an upgrade
i dunno
upgrade
well we can look for we can look at upgrade or we can look at um user friendly
yeah simplification
yeah
simplification so
mm-hmm
they could have a crap remote that came with their t. v. that's just impossible to use or maybe it broke or maybe they're just missing it
mm-hmm
uh-huh mm
and we also need to talk about if we're only gonna have the very simple ones or also have the other ones just separate somehow or
hmm
can you like i mean this may be too complicated but i wish i had something to explain it like if it was just a simple
yeah
either this way or this way that had like the main buttons and then you could like pull something out
kind of and like you got the rest the buttons but the rest of them like went in
ooh
the remote there are remote controls like that yeah
do you know what i'm saying
kind of pull out of the side
like some t. v. s they have a sort of uh a sliding screen on the remote control of it that hides all the complicated buttons
mm
ooh
so if you wanna do something complicated like programme your television or re tune it
then you you open up this little hatch or or slide the screen down and there's all the all the special buttons
mm-hmm
mm-hmm
'cause then 's like people who don't wanna ever look at them
never even have to see them and if you like get the instruction manual that comes with it and you just don't even read it then you'll never even know that those things can pull out
mm-hmm
mm-hmm
yeah
mm-hmm
and you're a happy person and everyone else doesn't have to have like two remotes one that has the easy ones and one that has
yeah that's a good idea
more complicated ones but 's all still in one
yeah
mm-hmm
i think that's a good idea yeah
mm
um we have to be careful that that that doesn't impede um the chip transmitting information but um that's gonna be mostly technological thing
yeah
good point
yeah
yeah
um
okay um so what are we emphasising
i what in this project
si simplicity and fashion
i think simplicity fashion
simplicity and fashion
yeah mm
okay those are very good goals i think um that we have to keep in mind in with everything we do
simplicity and fashion and yeah or usability speci however you wanna say that
which includes um an emphasis on making the infra red very functional so that you don't have to travel around a lot
mm-hmm
yeah
yeah
what can you do to like make the infra red more functional like why would it not be
um
i'm just wondering
i think it's a lot to do with battery but that's just my
okay
the battery and that i think that the chip takes the data and presents it well without sort of scattering
mm-hmm
so 's just the quality of the chip
yeah
i think so
okay
the quality uh quality of all the components really i mean we can't really do anything shoddy work 'cause it's
yeah
gonna be visible down the line
so our target group we're saying fifteen to thirty five
well i dunno how useful that number is if we're not doing
s voice recognition which i kind of i kind of feel like voice recognition is not necessary in a remote control
yeah
yeah
i don't
like it might be necessary for a t. v. but not for the remote c you know
it's yeah it's pretty it's pretty high tech
mm mm
seems a little bit
yeah
mm-hmm
yeah and it might be too expensive
and if the whole idea is you're using a remote then why would you have voice
like you know what i mean and then it's like you wouldn't need a remote you'd just talk to your t. v.
mm-hmm
yeah
it's for like the ultimately lazy people who can't even be bothered to pick up the remote
ooh
yeah
mm yeah
maybe i mean if i get m more numbers i'll e mail you before the next meeting in terms of ages
i
but this doesn't divide up anything and there was only a hundred subjects also which isn't i mean
mm-hmm
mm-hmm
really isn't that representative
especially if it's a hundred subjects that th they then can subdivide into age groups that means there's very few in each age group so
yeah but i th i think regardless we're we're aiming for the under sixty five or something
under sixty five okay that's a good start
yep
um
i'd say we're uh can we narrow it down to maybe um
teenagers and families
'cause that would go up to like fifty
or like single professionals or something
twenty to like fifty five
okay single
yeah
i dunno
it's it's hard to narrow it down
it's really hard to figure out right now
i think the product appeals across a quite a broad range of ages
mm-hmm
i mean we we said simplicity is is one of the features so it's going to appeal to people maybe people who have problems with technology
you know people who get scared by having lots of buttons and that might be older people
okay
mm-hmm
but then we've also got fashion which is something that definitely appeals to younger people
yeah
well maybe we don't have to defi define the target group by the demographic of age maybe we can define it by like the demographic of
right
like h t how much money they have to spend or something like that like
yeah
yeah aim for a an income group
that's a good point
well obviously it has to be someone who owns a television and like how recently have they bought their television like that sort of thing
mm-hmm
mm-hmm
yeah
mm
so maybe it's more useful to d d to define objectives like fashion and simplicity than to find specific target group as far as age is because
yeah t probably
yeah
yeah things so different will appeal to different people but
okay
um oh there're a couple functions do we want something so that do we want some kind of thing to find it if it's lost
mm
yeah
like a button on a t. v. you can press and it'll ring or something i don't know like or beep
h
i mean like i said before
fifty per cent of of the fru f like frustration someone can have that was the biggest one and half the people said that happened and we all mentioned it before we knew about it
mm-hmm
yeah
and if we're talking about making something easy that sort of goes along with it so it wouldn't be like a random thing to sort of add in
mm
it would be relevant to like the overall goal i think so
mm
yeah that'll probably be good
okay we have to we have about four minutes left to define our functions
so let's do that quickly
um so we want something to keep it from getting lost
yep
yeah
and we want
um
we want large buttons for the essential things
yeah
yeah
large accessible buttons for the essentials
we want a possibility to um to get um
a possibility to get the extra functions
mm-hmm
yeah
which are kind of hidden away in some way or
well not hidden but they're uh
they're not as prominent as the main features
mm-hmm
hmm
um yeah hidden way
and we also want it to be fashionable which i'm not sure if that's a function so much as a um yeah
on your coffee table it's not like an eye sore that kind of thing
mm-hmm
yeah
alright
okay do it
any other essential functions that we need
battery
do we need a long life battery
battery battery use
yeah but i think that goes in with simplicity and ease of use really
yeah
but we might as well
so you never have to change the battery
yeah
we should maybe investigate whether it needs a battery at all
i suspect the remote control does need a battery but
yeah i would imagine
yeah
i dunno if you can
just 'cause it is an electronic device the
yeah
mm
it i think it does
i don't i don't think of a way you can operate a chip and convert that much data without without one
yeah without the energy yeah
but you could maybe have it in a little charging station like a mobile phone or like a little cradle for your ipod
yeah that's that's possible
you could we could maybe do that instead
yeah
so you don't ha you got like a rechargeable battery
charging
yeah
i dunno that might contribute to less people losing it too if it it stays in one place
mm-hmm
mm
we have to think about um space in living rooms too like 'cause they're i mean would you put it on top of the t. v.
mm
i don't know just think okay that's that's a good idea we'll keep it
yeah
think it's
that's just off the top of my head
and maybe fun
okay
um 'kay we're gonna conclude now has everyone said their functions and 'kay
yep
um after the meeting we're gonna each complete a sks um a questionnaire and a summaries summary
i don't know what summarisation
um and then we'll have our lunch break
after that we have thirty minutes of individual work
um i'll make sure to put up um the minutes and the project documentation and including these powerpoint slides
if everyone could do that as well that'd be great
um you each have individual actions i. um i. d. industrial design you've your components concept user interface the user interface concept market trend wa watching
and as as per last time you'll get specific incrat instructions from your personal coach e mailed to you
and hopefully i hope next time you'll be able to access more of the web site that they they seem to tell you that you could
yeah who knows
it's kinda frustrating but um
be sure to note any frustrations or any um issues that come up in your um in your um summary
okay
mm 'kay
sounds good
great seeing y'all
it's good
did you um were you able to like put yours in the group folder
yes i just did that
okay
hopefully it is there for people
yep
yeah
looks like there are um looks like there's a second one kind of of mine that's that i didn't do
yeah
it's from like an earlier project i think so um
okay
where is that
yours is
under the shared folder i don't know it might not even be under yours as well
technical
so in there we have technical functions presentation working design presentation and the functional requirements
projects
at least that's what i have in
i only have three i just have like our three
yeah that's what i have as well r rose so
yeah
okay
you don't have mine
no but that's 'cause i think yours is in the e mail separate like it's not on the server
s
yeah
mm
but if i open it and then save it probably will be there
oh wait never mind you can't save it to the
okay
well i'll figure that out in the meantime
okay
okay
okay
mm-hmm
mm yeah
okay
i g yeah
time is it
fourteen twenty six
okay
lovely to see you all again
um it's our conceptual design meeting and it's starting at approximately fourteen twenty five and so we have forty minutes for this one again and so we'll go just after three o'clock
um okay our agenda we're gonna do an opening i'm gonna review the minutes of the last meeting
then we'll have your three presentations um and then we'll have to make a decision on the remote control concepts and finally we'll close
okay
so opening
um these are our minutes from r the functional design
we decided our target group is the focus on who can afford it
because we have international appeal and we said it's for all age groups different um functions of it
our main objectives were simplicity and fashion
and s um in specific functions are something to keep the remote from getting lost large buttons for the essential functions
a possibility for extra functions like a sliding a sliding piece and a long life battery or a charging station
okay now three presentations
i'd like to do it in this order first do the conceptual specification of components
properties and materials um and then the conceptual specification of user interface and finally trend watching
that would be me
yep
alright
well
mm
'kay
function f. eight it
there we go
alright
um i'm very excited by this one actually guys i uh had a lot of fun doing it
components design
this is where you look at what does it take to make a remote control and what should we make our specific remote control out of
um
so we need to examine each element separately but we're designing a full thing so you wanna keep it integrated as a whole
the main elements of remote controls in general and therefore ours as well
are the case the buttons the circuit board with the chip and the battery
these are all things that we had sort of addressed before
but i'm gonna take each one a little bit separately here as we figure out what they should be made of and what they should look like
the case uh the options that i've gotten from headquarters about what we can do um there's there's the shape of a case
we could do a flat sh a flat case a curved case or maybe even a double double curved case
i haven't seen any pictures of what this exactly looks like yet just keep that in mind
but these are the options that we have from manufacturing and we can make our case out of plastic
the m the main base will be plastic but we have all these sort of fashion and technological elements we can add in
wood latex titanium rubber or other coloured types of plastic
that would be our case
um buttons for buttons we have um pushbuttons which is what real reaction uses the most often
but we also have scror scroll wheels which can have integrated pushbuttons or we could go all high tech and have an l. l. c. d. screen
mm
um circuit board and chip we can have a simple one a regular one or an advanced one depending on what our other needs are
and then battery i think is where things get most exciting
we're talking about long life batteries here
um we can we can have your sort of basic double a. batteries but we also have these options of um using a kinetic battery
like are used in high tech watches where you just have to move it a little bit to get it to power up
um so simple movements like pushing buttons would recharge the battery
or a solar battery although there are slight um complications with solar batteries as in we can't use a latex case if we have a solar battery
hmm
or um something they only described as the type of battery you find in torches from about fifty years ago flashlights
not quite sure what that is but that's the description that i received so that's what i'm passing on to you
so those are our options
um personal preferences that i was thinking through here's what we've been talking about all through fashion and simplicity
so if we're going for fashion in our cases
i think that what we're gonna wanna look at is a curved or a double curved case probably with a variety of design elements
maybe titanium maybe some wood
we're gonna have to investigate that better when i get specifics of the actual materials but that's sort of what i have in mind
and we wanna go for simplicity
probably pushbuttons but i'm sort of intrigued by the idea of a scroll scroll wheel if anyone has anything
mm
any ideas on that
i mean i know the ipods and things right now have touch scroll um buttons which are exactly like what they're describing
so that might be something we wanna look into
and i'm really intrigued by the idea of a kinetic battery
solar i don't think would be such a good idea because how often are you sure that your remote control will get a certain amount of light
but this idea of the kinetic that you don't have to replace and that a simple just shaking it around will make it work
i think that that m would be a very interesting thing
but i think we'd also wanna go for e a simple chip or regular chip to keep our costs down
uh we really only need a regular or advanced chip t if we're gonna start using an l. c. d.
so i think we want to be aware of not making things overly t
technological if they don't need to be 'cause that'll keep our manufacturing price way down
that's what i have for options
um i'd appreciate anyone's input but that's what i'm seeing for the future of the the look of this thing
is double curved like would be like two hands kind of thing
i'm not sure
i haven't received any specific
okay
visuals of this yet
'cause i'm imagining like double curved is like you know
like two sides that curve and then like one curve would just be like a single vertical ish kind of looking thing but i've no idea
this is what i'm sort of
yeah
i'm not sure but i'll let you know as soon as i get any pictures
sounds good
yeah i wonder
i know if we do have a double curved case it can't have any titanium in it
but the titanium they were quite they're marketing quite hard to us as being used in the space programme so that could be quite interesting
space age remote
mm-hmm
just all things to keep in mind
just an interesting marketing kind of element
yeah
that's about all i have to do guys
i hope i didn't go through that too quickly
uh just a real quick question um the weight of these different elements have you no idea okay
yeah n no idea no idea
um
i'm assuming
that a kinetic battery isn't gonna take up that much weight and that a tita titanium is very light i know
mm-hmm
mm-hmm
um but other than that's really basic i mean that's all i have gotten so far
okay
alright
any other questions
uh-huh
don't think so
no
okay
mm 'kay
i have save this in the uh shared projects if anyone wants to look and i have c considerable notes on the topic as well
thank you perfect
thanks
if anyone needs any more information
uh
um if you made notes yourself you can put those on our um underneath our oh uh in your book then don't worry about that
just in my notebook but if anyone has any specific questions don't hesitate to email me or something
alright
uh i guess i can
'kay now we're um concepts concepts of user interface
yeah um
this one's so much tighter than the other one
i know
okay
nope
there we go
here you are
jess
g oh geez
alright so i'm gonna describe the the concept of the user interface of this des device
um we've talked about uh the two essential properties of the user interface
we want it to be simple and we want it to be fashionable
um
other we've also got to remember that this is a device that serves as a useful purpose
uh we want people to be able to use it s as a remote control
so we need to determine what the essential functions of the d of the device are and make sure that we include that we've included all of those and that we actually end up with a device that is going to be useful to people
we have a number of different choices for a design concept um and s that's that's something that that i'll show you some examples of um
but essentially we need to choose how how is this device going to work
how how what kind of model is there going to be for user interaction with this device
uh once we've chosen a a concept for it we can then design the features around the concept
making sure that we get all the essential functions in the device and uh the extra functions and the more advanced features
and of course we also have to make it look cool
so basically that's what we don't want
m we don't want lots of buttons uh complicated features
we want something that looks nice and simple
here's a a fairly simple device
hmm
this is an an ipod from apple
um i think the main thing to notice about it is it just has four buttons
it's very minimalistic in its design
uh you use these four buttons to m to move around a range of settings on the small l. c. d. screen
um the thing i like about this is that
it's very very quick to access the main features
uh you can just about make out uh that the button three buttons are uh previous track next track and play pause
they're the main the main features of the ipod the things you will use a all the time
um then if you want to do anything more advanced
you go into the little menu on the l. c. d. screen and you use the buttons just to scroll around and and find the more advanced features that you want
so i think that's that's a good a good kind of model that we could have
um
here's a another example
this is uh it's an interesting idea and i think i it looks pretty cool
um it's certainly got novelty value
uh it's nice and colourful it's nice and bright
mm
uh it's also something that you can kind of feel your way around
the buttons are are different shapes and and you can sort of yeah if you're watching t. v. in the dark or whatever
you can work out which button's which and basically yeah it's ith it's fun
so i i like i like this idea of just having buttons for the features that you use most often
so you'd need a few buttons to select your favourite channels
i mean most people when they watch t. v.
they have two hundred and fifty channels on their t. v. and they watch of 'bout four of them at the most
so you have buttons for your favourite channel changing the volume
which is something you do all the time when you're watching t. v. and the button to switch it off in case you get bored
um other features things like adjusting the brightness tuning the t. v. uh i don't know what else you do with a t. v.
um but these are these are all necessary functions
uh you can't have a t there's no point having a television that you can't tune or that you can't set the contrast
so we need to find a way of including these somehow
um and one other suggestions i'd make is to in is to include in a menu system a bit like on the ipod
so we'd either have a small l. c. d. display on the device itself
or uh have a dis a menu display that comes up on your television and can b be controlled through the device
hmm
and that would allow you to access access the advanced features uh whilst keeping a very small and simple set of buttons for the features that you use most often
okay
so you'd be advocating an l. c. d. then
i think that's that's one way to go yes
okay
um i mean there are there are advantages and disadvantages if you if you have an l. c. d. display it's it's nice
because it's it it lets you just sort of sit there and st and control your television from your armchair
mm-hmm
there are disadvantages an an l. c. d. display would have to be quite small
'cause we're we're i well we're i assume we're gonna be making quite a small device
right
um it would also have to have uh a kind of backlighting in it
'cause you ten you tend to watch t. v. in the dark but you need to be able to see your l. d. d. l. c. d. display
mm-hmm
right
the alternative is to have a an on screen display on your television that you control through your remote control
uh
a bit like a bit like how they have these um digital boxes where you you press the buttons and it comes up with your this thing of watch lo what's on each channel
mm-hmm
i mean that that's also a good idea
okay
it's it can it does have it's problems as well
if you've got a small t. v. and you're sitting on the other side of a room it's hard to read the little text that comes up
mm
mm-hmm
uh but that's a that's a design decision that we can make
'kay
i do think that um one of the important features for a remote is seeing a menu and seeing what's on
um and so like favourite channels is is applicable
yeah
but i think th that you do need to have some kind of function where it's um you have t you can see the title of the show or possibly a description of it
well
are you are you tak
yeah
like i i know i use that often enough
wait but is that separate from what he was saying
yeah
well if it if it was a l. l. c. d. on th on the remote i don't know that you could f that you'd be able to see a
no i think i think we're talking menu like contrast and tuning the v. c. r. or something if i've understood you correctly rather than menu as what's on
okay
yeah that that would be one of the features yes
okay
but it's it's it's something to bear in mind is that if we put a display on the remote control
'cause that would be more specifically a digital box mm-hmm
the c uh communication is one way so you can't have the televisions and information back to the remote control at least i don't think you can
oh good point
mm
um i'm not sure
yeah
okay now we're moving on to market
should i plug that in
marketing
is that going on
okay
maybe it's just not is it on
uh that should be alright actually
ri what f. do you have to press five
eight
i just keep pressing lots of 'em
well i don't know how relevant all of this gonna be
if anything the that they gave me
no signal
oops it's not plugged in quite in well enough
alright
there we are
oop there we go
mm 'kay
oh yeah
okay so we're gonna look a little bit at trend watching
basically i was given um an executive summary that was a market investigation on remote controls that was recently conducted
and then also some fashion watchers in paris and milan commented on some things that are gonna be going on this year
so first um they had people they ranked um the important aspects of r remote controls
and right now i d they're saying that currently there's a functional look and feel preference
but that really over the next year it it that's gonna be switching to fancy look and feel remotes so that just goes back to
the whole desire of our c real reaction company wanting to focus on fashion and so even though we're stressing when we're talking
we've all been talking about this like simplicity and easy to use idea
they're sort of wanting us to remember that the number one thing for everyone is that it's fancy look and feel
and as these are ranked the top one is doubly important to the second one
which is doubly important to the third one so just to take that weight into account
okay
the second thing that was mentioned as important was the technological innovations
that would be like if we use something like the space material or the l. c. d. screen things like that
and then ease of use was the third most important whi so really
no matter what we need to focus the most on fancy look and feel according to this
i don't know how much we agree with that
and then the fashion watch talks about that this year's top trend for clothes
shoes and furniture is fruits and vegetables and tha that there's a preference for spongy tight material
s sweet
and so that brings us to my personal preferences
who wants a spongy remote or one with fruit and vegetable padding
personally i don't really think that i want one that's gonna go out of style or go stale excuse the pun um in a year so
even though this is coming from us as you know trend watch market research i don't know how much of it we necessarily wanna take away
also considering that the d research b has been carried out by real reaction i'm a little hesitant as to like
how these questions may have been worded and if necessarily this whole fashion to technology y edas ease of use is necessarily the right ranking
personally like i might reverse it but if we're working for this company then i guess no matter what we have to stress fashion the most
but it doesn't necessarily need to be a spongy material
mm
that there's all kinds of scope for imagination in that one though
yeah
i don't have a lot of notes to share if you want them that pretty much sums it up
so yeah
okay do we have any s some questions for this let's see um
yeah what can i possibly enlighten on
um do you have any ideas how to possibly use these
um how to how to use a fruit or vegetable or um or the spongy material at all
like could we make a s like could we make a spongy remote
it would be easier on the hands
if it's latex if it's latexy
it's kind of and then it we would have to find a way to protect like the chip and all that i dunno
um mean
a kind of thing that
an uh i if th my understanding of a latex case is that it's in fact hard to protect stuff inside
but
but that it's covered with the latex which is spongier and softer on your hands
mm-hmm
it's there's something to be said i mean we we got that thing earlier from you about um not wanting it to
r. r. repetitive stress injuries and things and and
mm-hmm
mm-hmm
yeah
yeah something grippable i mean we don't we don't we don't wanna go spongy maybe
yeah so something m m instead of a necess yeah grip i'm thinking grip more than like sinking into your hands
yeah
you know i and i think i'm envisioning more like
yeah
yeah
you know the material that you have when you sit on like a bicycle so that it doesn't hurt when you're sitting down for a long time
mm-hmm
mm-hmm
like i'm imagining that sort of thing i don't know what th that material's called
yeah i think that given the list of materials i w i was forwarded it's that seems doable
could we go in fruit and vegetable colours
we could colour co ordinate them li
f for sure or maybe like
um couple main ones being like i dunno lemons or strawberries or something
the buttons could be fruit shaped
could they be smelly
i is it supposed to be shaped like a vegetable
oh god
oh well it's quite easy to s shape thing like carrot isn't it
uh like uh i dunno like uh carrots or something
i don't know
or carrot shaped mm
maybe or
or maybe the buttons could be shaped like different fruits
like large button that's what i was thinking of yeah
what about the idea of like a round remote
instead of like a vertical up and down one
like in terms of holding it
be yeah
kind of like a potato
like that's a f shape of a fruit
yeah
it'd be harder to f bu uh buttons i think
just to tie it in a little
might would you think you you do you think you'd be able to hold it
'cause i think the reason they're long is yeah
it'd be harder to press button
depends
harder to push
when you when you use a remote do you press the buttons with your thumb usually
yeah
or your fingers
um
i usually hold it in one hand
maybe
or maybe you want something that's shaped like a mobile phone so you you hold it in one hand and you press the buttons with your thumb
i
yeah that's ts how i tend to do it
but then the buttons would have to be very small
yeah 'cause otherwise your fingers can't move around
don't you think
no just thumb sized
jus
but i like i
but i mean in order to get to all of them you know
yeah
yeah
they would have to be within a certain amount of space with each other
maybe
that's true
but if you've only got like four or five buttons anyway then it's it's not so much a problem perhaps
right
i when i'm when i'm pressing buttons on my ipod that's how i do it hold it and press the four
mm-hmm
so you hold it in one hand and you press you press the buttons with your thumb and
yeah
yeah or in and use my thumb or my pointer finger on the touch scroll wheel
mm-hmm
and you find that works quite well
i love the idea of the wheel like the ipod
yeah
mm-hmm
is that the button on an ipod is it what is it is it just four buttons or is it li more like a scroll thing
'cause th
it's like five 'cause there's one in the middle
it's a scroll yeah it's a wheel
it wel well yeah it would i mean each version of it has been a little bit different but
the one i have doesn't have the four on i like around it i don't think
oh yeah you had one of the in between ones when they weren't doing that anymore
ts and you press the centre button that's that's your all purpose select button right there
right
oh i see right yeah
oh okay
since it's the one in the centre that's not marked yeah
yeah that's quite a good design
i think why it would be good for us is 'cause like you could have the same wheel sort of effect for like channel flipping and then the other one could be like for volume
yeah
like just the idea of like those so few buttons for main things but then how you could go back to the menu and like
uh uh t
i dunno if we would want it on the screen there or on the actual t. v.
i kind of am wanting to say on the t. v. 'cause if you're changing the brightness don't you wanna see it happening kind of
yeah
hmm
mm
yeah
yeah
and then you could still have that available
yeah i think an l. c. d. screen might be good in theory but not as useful in practice
i think it could be difficult in practice yeah
yeah
also z yeah 'cause you would be z looking down at the l. c. d. screen than back up at your t. v. and people don't wanna do that
mm-hmm
right
mm-hmm
um
okay um we have we've about fifteen minutes left so i'm i'm gonna
oh we probably have to get going don't we
uh-huh
continue with my pres presentation
um i've one more slide before we close but in that slide is when we need to make decisions about this these kinds of things
'kay
so i'll just bring that up and show you all
before we move on
um
if i get any more information of fruits and vegetables i'll let you know
could
could we uh could we have changeable covers like for your mobile
like to make it different fruits
in different fruit and vegetable colours yeah
yeah it's possible
yeah and then like the the covers could be spongy latex wherea but the actual model could be titanium
exactly
and you could co ordinate with your house or whatever
i think maybe th the packaging it should be like a lemon and the the packaging is like the peel
all these options
so instead of opening the box you just kind of peel it and the remote control's inside
ooh
well there we go
oh
don't know
ah hmm-hmm hmm
the ipod packaging is me like was so that was like half the fun
it's like the way it all comes all cute
yeah
mm
lemons
options
okay um components concept
energy chip on print
uh hu oh oh yes
right i had sort of skipped over that hoping it wouldn't get
g
be necessary but um
that's th th this is the agenda they gave me
so can you just explain what that is real quick
alright so um decisions what the okay deci decisions on energy i'm thinking is based on the battery
mm-hmm
um i dunno what do people think about this kinetic battery idea
i think it's awesome
i think it's really cool
am i
yeah
yeah i mean it would
t totally take care of our problem of not wanting to change batteries
yeah
yeah um i think it's good as as long as we consider the the cost and the uh how reliable it is
but as far as i know the technology is good
right i haven't gotten any yeah any more information on cost other than it's more expensive than a regular battery
costs
but um but if we're using a an i a cheaper chip then it'll even out i think
but over time
um circuit boards
um yeah i got a whole bunch of information on how circuit boards are produced
they're they're thin fibreglass with copper wires etched on to them and di i think they're quite easily printed on by machine
which is chip on print is where the machine prints on the wires and solders it all together for us
i don't really know what to tell you as far as decisions
i wasn't really given any options i was just given that this is how they're done
okay
um
yeah i can't can't really tell you
i can i can tell you a whole lot about how it works
but i don't know any decisions on
if they're if they're really options
yeah
i'm sorry i did f
okay
al all circuit boards are pretty much the same i think
uh it's fairly fairly standard
yeah
um okay then we'll move on to the case
um oh bu i guess maybe if we decided on like a simple a regular or an advanced chip maybe
right
well okay here's the here's the thing on the chips that i that i got
um simple regular advanced chip on print
the chip on print includes an infrared sensor so we don't have to worry about that
um
'kay the pushbutton if we're gonna have pushbuttons they require a simple chip but a scroll wheel requires a regular chip and an l. c. d. requires advanced
do we want a scroll wheel or do we just want pushbuttons
um
i don't think we ne really need the scroll whe wheel
i mean it might be nice for changing the volume
oh
it would be nice for changing the volume but i don't know how useful it'd be for changing the channel
uh but
i don't think it would really work
'cause you don't have control over numbers or
yeah it's a
yeah you really need buttons for changing a channel
yeah th it'd be it'd be handy for going through if there was an on screen menu of your channel choices than you can scroll down on the scroll
but if you c if you could scroll through the channels and then the volume would just be
yeah
yeah
we have five minutes left for the meeting so
and the volume would just be like the same way forward and backward as i'm just thinking like it would make it much like sleeker sort of looking
yeah
yeah
and otherwise no matter how may buttons we have we're gonna have like you know
yeah
black with red sticking out and th no it's gonna inevitably sort of start looking like those group of sort of ugly ones that we saw stacked up
yeah
hmm
so have a scroll for volume
f or for all those secret functions
f
when you get on the on screen menu of all your functions that your remote could do for you without the buttons and you could have a scroll wheel to go through those menus
i think yeah i think a scroll wheel would be nice but it's not necessary
right
um
so we could either go with a simple or a regular chip depending and maybe we could table that decision for later
um
i don't know
i think w well i think when we go on to the une userface
we're gonna have to decide the interface we're gonna have to decide um whether we're gonna have a scroll or not
okay
well let's think about that while we talk about the case
okay let's do case
uh i'm kinda liking the idea of latex if if spongy is the in thing
yeah
i'm a little um i'm a little hesitant about it because i'm worried about protecting the stuff on the inside
okay
um
oh could it be hard and then something around it
uh yeah everything i've
yeah i would be more okay with like a titanium actual thing and then maybe like a mobile phone kind of thing
n oh wha what i've what i've seen just not related to this but of latex cases before
mm-hmm
is that there's uh like a hard plastic inside and it's just covered with the latex
okay
not too thick a layer of latex just enough to be grippable like bike handles or or anything that you've seen like that
mm-hmm
okay
the inside is hard
i don't think we need to worry about protecting the circuit board i think that that's done for us
ge o
okay
'kay
yeah
so we uh we do want latex
yeah
yeah
okay
latex
um and probably in colours maybe fruity vegetable colours
yeah
fruity colours
okay um let's go to the ufe user interface then we'll come back to the chip i suppose
oh and we want a curved case yeah
or a double curved
well we don't really know what the difference is right
i'm thinking curved of some sort
yeah
yeah okay
yeah
we don't really know what the difference
um okay interface the type and the supplements
so push or scroll right
um
yep
or both
um
and i think if we wanna keep our costs down we should just go for pushbuttons
'cause then we can have a a simple chip and it's simpler it's it's cheaper to make pushbuttons than it is a scroll button
good point
so in terms of uh in terms of uh economics it's probably better to have pushbuttons
mm-hmm
and if we had a sc an on screen um kind of thing that you could scroll through like you can use your buttons to scroll through things
yeah yeah it's uh it's it's fairly simple
i think that yeah
for channel surfing i think a scroll an actual like an ipod's kind of scroll thing would be too fast i dunno
yeah
i say pushbuttons at least unless we get any information but i have no idea how much more expensive a scroll wheel is than than a pushbutton
but it's gotta be some more expensive so i think it might be better to put our money into the stuff like the kinetic battery and the cool case
yeah
mm-hmm
yeah
because
is that okay with you
interesting
how you feeling
yeah
and let's like see if we get anything else
i mean i'm not like hard sold on the scroll wheel it's more just to give it a different kind of look
mm-hmm
but if it's gonna be in a latex type thing and that's gonna look cool then that's probably gonna have a bigger impact than the scroll wheel
it might be cool enough
yeah
okay so we're gonna go with um type pushbuttons and then supplements how are we gonna do that
yep
uh what do you mean by supplements exactly
um i assume that's what else we're gonna like h ha the um the additional buttons we can use
um
oh
so we're gonna have like a menu button so that we can access on screen things then
yep
yeah
okay um so we're doing an on screen menu that we can scroll through
alright
um in
so what are what are our buttons gonna be
yeah
on off
on off uh volume favourite channels uh and menu
so like one through five or
yeah yeah about yeah like yeah a bit like radio presets
like a radio type sorta situation
um
pre set channels and then we're gonna need um numbers one through zero right
uh we wouldn't even need the numbers
no
i think maybe numbers seems is kind of old fashioned
well but in order to pre set a cha oh i guess you can just hold it down when you get to one when you're scrolling through
yeah yeah you can just and you need some kind of i dunno
mm
sort of up down kind of button but the volume control could double for that for example
yeah up down
mm-hmm
okay um finishing the meeting now
um our next meeting starts in thirty minutes um you each have things to do look and feel design user interface design
product evaluation and you two are going to work together on a prototype using modelling clay
you'll get specific instructions from your personal coach
ooh
cool
wow
um did we decide on a chip
let's go with a simple chip
simple chip
okay
yep
we are done
thank you everyone
oh i di these are already in our shared folder so
okay cool
clay
clay
i wasn't expecting that
okay um
welcome to our detailed design meeting
i'm pretty excited
let's start it's approximately fifteen forty or something like that
okay um the agenda we're gonna do an opening and then um i'll talk about the minutes from the last meeting
what we d discussed um then we'll have the prototype presentation and a look at the evaluation criteria
we'll look at the finances and finally a do a production evaluation and close
so starting off with the um last the last one oh i don't have it here um but we talked about energy
we're gonna use a kinetic battery um we want to use a simple chip because we're not gonna need a a shuffle um
we're gonna need a scroll um
we're choosing a latex case w in fruity colours that's curved and um we're using push buttons uh with a supplement of an on screen menu
and it sounded like we had set um like eight or nine buttons including five pre set channels
okay
let's do the look and feel design presentation first
right do you wanna start
right well we made three different prototypes and i guess we'll start with with this one
um we have our colours not are not fixed but this is the general shape
um it's you hold it sort of either like like this in your left hand or you switch it over and uh it's easily adaptable to either hand
you can push the buttons with your thumb like a mobile phone or you can push them with your
index finger of your other hand or even i mean there's a whole variety you can hold it like this and press it with your same index finger
uh we have the on off button at the tip very visible very big
we have our up and down buttons which are also gonna be our channel selectors and we have our little menu button here
if you push if you're just pushing these normally they're the menu buttons if uh the volume buttons rather
if you press select once they become channel changing buttons
if we press select three times
the menu with the other features and pro possibly also with your t. v. channel choices shows up and you have your five presets down here
um if people wanna grab hold of that see how it feels in your hand
that's our number one prototype
um do you wanna present the potato or shall i present the martian
like a little lightning in it
okay um
the little lightning bolt in it very cute
what
we call that one the rhombus uh the rhombus
i could
the v the rhombus rhombus
that's the rhombus yep
um this one is known as the potato uh it's
it's a how can i present it
it's an ergonomic shape so it it fits in your hand nicely
um
it's designed to be used either in your left hand or or in your right hand
um i've gone here just for just for four buttons on this one
um
the two blue buttons here are for adjusting the volume
so you've got volume up and volume down on the other side here
um the red ones are for uh changing channels channel up and channel down and that's um moves between your favourite channels that you've selected
uh this middle button here brings up the on screen menu and when you're working in the on screen menu you use the other four buttons to navigate around the menu system and the middle button uh to select
and that's basically it that's the potato
um on off
uh that would be one of your channels basically so like channel zero would be t to switch switch the machine off yeah
okay
yeah we turn it off
could the middle button of the on screen menu function as a power button
um not really it would make it hard to turn the machine off to turn your t. v. off
mm-hmm
if you pressed and held it maybe
yeah yeah that that'd be one way of doing it yeah
if you like held it down that would be on off
yeah
that'd work yeah
on off that's a possibility yeah
okay
and then finally we have um the martian or the pear either way
um it's a bit different just a little bit more of a creative feel
uh you have the on off toggle stem on the top
we have the five preset seeds
and then you have on the sides to make it a little bit more three dimensional
you have your channel changing volume changing buttons and your menu button right here in the middle
so that's for your consideration as well plus it's an interesting talking point to have standing up
let's pass
we figured it could stand up like this on your table if you wanted it to if i made the bot the bottom flat
uh-huh
sorry what's the yellow one in the middle i forgot
uh the menu select button
very interesting
i think that one's my favourite
so that's
so that's our three prototypes
um basically in terms of making decisions
what we'd need to do is first of all decide on a form uh which of the three different shapes we want
then decide what kind of button layout we want how many buttons
and then to choose what colours we want to make the buttons and if we wanna put any text on the device
like label on the buttons or put a brand name or or a logo on it or whatever
mm-hmm
we were we were thinking that
normally we'd go for fruity colours but maybe we're also thinking that your sort of middle aged man for an example customer
might not want a fruity coloured remote so m maybe we'd have one version that's a bit toned down maybe with with less contrasts on it
mm 'kay
yeah something still a little bright to make it hard to lose but
would
yeah
but we don't want it to look like a kids' toy
yeah
now that was one thing that we brought up over email
i don't know if you picked up your email but um the f the um feature that we considered for it not getting lost
yeah
right
well we were we were talking about that a little bit when we got that email and we think that each of these are so distinctive
that it it's not just like another piece of technology around your house
it's gonna be somewhere that it can be seen
mm-hmm
so we're we're not thinking that it's gonna be as critical to have the loss
but if it's like under covers or like in a couch you still can't see it
it's really
would it be very difficult to um just have an external device that like i dunno
you tape to your to your t. v. um that when you press it you ha a little light beep goes off
do you think that would be conceptually possible
i think it would be difficult technologically
i think
mm-hmm
because if your if your remote's lost it's probably under the settee and in that case you can't you can't send an infrared sing signal to it to find it
mm
s so it's
i'm not quite sure how it would work and then i wonder if it's if it's more just a gimmick then anything else
that's true mm 'kay
yeah
uh i mean ho how many times do you really seriously lose your remote control and would would a device like that actually help you to find it
there might be something that you can do in the circuit board and the chip
to make it make a noise or something but it would take a lot more development than we have this afternoon
mm-hmm
okay that's a fair evaluation
getting lost
um we so we do we've decided not to worry about that for now
okay 'cause well the designs are very bright so you're right they're gonna stick out but um
so d do people have a preference as far as feel and functionality
um
i feel like this is simil or it's sort of what already exists so if we're trying to think of something sort of like new and fun
even though this is like what you're init i'm initially drawn to just 'cause it's like comfortable and like not different
i sort of like this one like i i don't know why it just it's like small but still sort of like cute looking i dunno
but i also like the b the side buttons on that one like i think that's kind of neat
mm-hmm
but i dunno how much any of this has to do with the fashionable sort of cool looking thing that we also need to focus on
could we maybe have like an extra button on the top for on off
so then w we wouldn't have to have like a dual function
mm yeah that's good that's good
ah there we go
yeah it's possible yeah yeah
here stick it on
put an extra the button on
sure
um uh why don't we do a product evaluation using your criteria if you've developed some
well do we w like i think we're supposed to have one that we do it for
oh okay
okay
that was i was a little vague on what exactly i'm supposed to do but let me i have to like write something on the whiteboard so
so where
okay
do you need this or just write on the white board
no i actually don't have like a powerpointy thing 'cause i think it would be redundant
okay
right
okay
i dunno
it's kind of like uh like a joystick kind of thing you know kinda push it
ooh
cool
hey
'kay
maybe a little smaller than that
no i kinda like it
that's hard to miss
it makes look more fruity as well
oh it does it's kind of like
it's like a deformed foot i dunno
there it could have a stem like that 'cause i do l kind of like the stem
like
yeah
yeah
it almost helps you ge keep a grip too 'cause it goes in between fingers
yeah
yeah
interesting
i like this one
okay is that where people are leaning then the potato
variety of colours are nice
i like the idea of the i mean that's really gotten the simplicity of the buttons down that one
i think i'm leaning towards the potato
mm-hmm
i am worried about like um using a menu
um in that like i withing menus there are submenus and so how do you get back to the main menu
hmm
yeah
well that on the ipod for example you just every time you wanna go back you hit the menu button again and it brings you back one level
but that has a menu button separate from a select button whereas if this one's both the menu and the select button
yeah
good point
this is it's the up and down buttons are used for scrolling up and down for a list of choices
okay
you find the choice that you want and you press uh you press the right button uh
could these be used for going to submenus or
yeah
yeah so they're used for going into and out of your submenus yeah
maybe yeah maybe it can be one of those if you press down and hold
okay
for two seconds then it brings you back one level or something
mm-hmm
okay
well as long as we have that in mind as we're designing it still mm 'kay
okay so which one are we sort of roughly looking at to address whether or not it meets our s um necessities the yellowy one is that
the potato
are we leaning towards the potato
potato
i think so
okay well we can obviously change it after we go through each different one
okay
so basically what we need to do is some of the things that we've talked about before we need to make sure that that remote actually does conform to the things that we said it was going to
okay
so what we sort of wanna do is that we each need to separately
rank each of the following things and then i'll tabulate an average just to make sure that it does meet that
okay
so we'll just go through them one at a time and we'll just go around and each of you can tell me on a scale of one to seven with one being really extremely true
and seven being not true at all or false if the remote that we've created conforms to the following criteria
so we can do this one first
first we wanna know if it meets the fancy look and feel um objective
so like in my opinion the for now at least the yellow one is probably somewhere in the middle so i'm gonna say it's like a three
that's just my opinion
yeah
what does each of you
i i kind of think it's it's unique enough that i'd give it a one or a two
okay well give it a number sorry
okay
i will give it a one
um i dunno if it's it's creative
i dunno if fancy is the word i would use
i dunno if any of them are fancy in i'd say two because c unique
okay
and two awesome
i'll go for two
alright and same sort of scale for functionality is it functional
i think it's extremely functional i'm gonna give it a one
yeah one
one
i think it's it's functional it's also pretty basic so i'll give it a two
okay
um functional
i think it'll get everything done i think it might be a little confusing at first um i don't know if that's gonna be a later one
okay
well there's some other ones i will address that yeah
okay then i'm gonna give it a two
awesome okay
um we wanna know next if it's technologically innovative
did you give a functional
yeah she said it was one
okay
um is it technologically innovative
mm
not really i mean not so much 'cause we we don't have the l. c. d. screen we don't have fancy chip
other than what it looks like i dunno if it's really
well the kinetic battery
in the battery that's it
i kinetic battery is a big one so
how many people would notice that though
mm
but it but we know it's there
but they'll notice it after like a year they'll be like hey i have never changed the battery
and if it's made of like latex that whole idea that's pretty cool
mm
i'll give it a three
just the material
'cause it we could've picked a lot of features that would've made it really
yeah
i i would say that it's
yeah like fancy versus creative it's it's
different
but does that equal innovative
i dunno
i'll give it a three
alright
everyone else
i'd say it's technologically it's not it's not unique i mean it's it's just it is just pushbuttons um so i i'd give it a four
think i'm gonna go with the four as well
mm 'kay
i really like that kinetic battery though
next is it easy to use
just so you know easy to learn will be separate so don't overlap them
mm 'kay
okay
i think it's really easy to use
i'll give it a two
um i'll give it a one
pretty hard to mess up
i'll say one
uh let's say two
alright
um we next wanna see if it has a spongy quality and if indeed it's made of latex or rubber i it's spongy all the way
give it a one
yeah
yeah
i wonder if it bounces when you drop it
ooh that you couldn't it'd be harder to break harder to lose
mm-hmm
mm
yeah
'cause there would be less impact maybe
iain what do you give it
mm
yeah i'd i'd give it a one
alright and the next is does it integrate some notion of fruits and vegetables
uh um
well is it gonna be yellow
it it might be 'cause that's our corporate colour isn't it
that's right yeah corporate colour
yeah
we didn't keep that in um well if we i know it would make it a little less c a little more confusing
we might wanna keep it yellow
but if we had all the buttons in black and a design in and the outside in yellow
that'd be our corporate one and we could also have alternative colours one a more conservative one one that's more fruity
yeah but if you had like a silvery kind of white or something
yeah
yeah
um and can we have like an r. r. inscribed on the bottom or something
if we had a yellow
sure
okay
oh yeah
yeah
alright so i think it it's
fruity so fruity
so it was inspired by the potato so i think it's pretty fruity
yeah
i think i it's kind of mangoey too
oh mango that that
yeah
mangoey is better yeah
i okay i'm giving it a one the mango put me over
yes
i like mangoes
mm
that's a much more trendy than a potato one
what are what's everyone's numbers
uh two
one
alright um and does the design match the appropriate behaviour
remember earlier we discussed that people don't use a lot of buttons that they use the channel flipping and the volume the most
i think we really took that into account a lot so i'm gonna give it a one
mm-hmm
yeah me too
uh one
did you say one rose
yes
okay um also we talked earlier about r. s. i. and wanting to prevent um any sort of like carpal tunnely kind of thing
do we think that the latex sort of grip appropriately takes that into account
i think i'll give it a two 'cause i almost feel like no matter what you do something is gonna happen
it's gonna be hard
yeah
yeah yeah
and if it's repetitive movement it is gonna be only four buttons that you're constantly pushing but um
um um worth the risk i think
i like how it fits in the hand though so i i'd go with a two
yeah
i'll i'll say two as well
because older people that aren't used to like texting with the thumb might find it a bit at first but
mm
'kay
yeah i'll i'll say two
alright awesome
and the ease of learning it
i know you were saying that you're a little bit nervous about that i dunno
it sort of reminds me of the ipod
i just got mine i still haven't read the instruction book and i'm doing okay so and i'm not good at learning technology
mm
so i'll give it a two
the menu system and the the fact that multiple buttons are used for different things might be a bit confusing
but i think if it's one it's one of those things that it might take you five minutes to figure out but you'll have it afterwards
mm-hmm
so i'd i think i'd give it a two i guess
i think it it's probably a little harder then most remotes to learn
because you have to you have to use the menu system and you have to tell it what your favourite channels are and that could take a bit of learning at first
oh good point
mm-hmm
but
once you've yeah once you'd learned how to use it i think it is a lot easier
so i'd i'd give it a four
okay
i think i'd give it a four too
it's a pretty high learning curve it'll be easy once you've done it but
mm-hmm
yeah
alright um also earlier we had something about losing it and so now we're not addressing that at all so
we we i think we can kind of say we addressed it with colour but
okay so in terms of not losing it do you think that on a scale of one to seven how easy or hard is it to lose
i'm gonna i'm gonna give it a four 'cause i think that you can still if it's in between somewhere where you can't see it
you're kind of not gonna find it but anywhere else it's gonna stand out
mm-hmm
yeah
um i'd say i'd give it uh a three i guess it depends on how tidy you are normally
mm i'd give it a four
um i'll give it a five 'cause i it would be easy to lose something like that yeah
small too
alright we also said simplicity how w how well does it address just being simple
simple to use or simple in design
do you know
i think overall 'cause we had said before our two main things were simplicity and fashion so those are the next two things we're gonna look at
separate from fancy like that sort of thing
right
um it like wants to be simple but it's not like totally totally simple so i'm gonna give it a two
i'm give it a three i guess
i'll give it a two
three
alright and fashionable
it's totally fashionable
it's hot i mean it's a mango come on
i'd give it a one
mango
i mean how fashionable can you make a remote
i think it's bringing technology and fashion together real really well
i dunno
i don't think it's quite as fashionable as my robot remote
i do like uh the little martian one
or alien or whatever he was
yeah the toggle on off switch it's really appealing
number
um two
three
one
and does it meet our like demographic need sort of for international appeal
that whole thing
just that it would se serve our audience
i don't see why not
mm-hmm
i think as long if we offer in a in at least three different colour arrangements
um yeah that's good
yeah
mm-hmm
so i'll give it a a two
yeah i'll say two
alright did anyone have any other features that they think were important that we didn't talk about
well um we didn't we didn't address the fact that it does need to b have a corporate logo
so let's let's make sure we keep that in mind that we ha that one of our colours concepts is corporate and has an r. r. on it
shall we uh
well i think all of them should have an r. r.
all of them should have r. r. yeah
and so we're gonna do that so it will address it fine
mm-hmm
mm 'kay
okay
that's me
lovely
okay now we're gonna look at finances
um i have an excel sheet that we're actually gonna calculate the cost um
so let me exit out of this first
okay um
whoa
oh my
i know
let me one more space
gonna zoom in real quick
okay
hand dynamo
we're using kinetic battery right
uh we're n using kinetic yeah
um and we're having one per
yeah
one okay
um electronics
single
simple simple rather
simple
simple
mm 'kay
um the case
uh uh uh double curved
guess it's double curved
it is pretty curvy
yeah
it's very curvy so okay
yeah i never did get a picture of those so i don't really know
our case material supplements oops we just skipped by them
well don't we need plastic and
no we we the plastic is the plastic for the inside is assumed
provided okay
the supplement is
the wood
oh i guess it was rubber rather than latex
i mean the rubber
it was rubber and special colour right
yeah
mm-hmm okay
do we have more than one special colour
yeah we're using we're gonna need at least two special colours
uh well
special colours isn't it
um
i don't know what the se the basic colour is though
per
i dunno where it yeah
well but we know that we're having at least three colours so
so let's y say three
well are we talking about on each colour combination or are we you know we'll like we'll have yellow and black
is that two special colours
yeah i dunno
or or is white and black then two more or
that i thi i thought that would be under yours
uh
i guess it's three three three
we'll just say three
mm-hmm
right
alright
maybe the r. r. will be in colour as well so yeah
interface we're doing push buttons
yeah
and how many buttons do we have
we have six
we've got five
oh no five
six with the power
oh six
six
yeah
anything else
no
oh we'll do we wa
are the buttons in special colour special f
i didn't get information on
oh wait
oh buttons oh so um
so the case material will just have one colour right but then the buttons will be in special colours
well does it but if we're making multiple varieties of this is where i'm getting confused
yeah
we're saying per unit
per unit okay okay
yeah per unit
okay so each unit will only have one colour on their but the case is
alright and each button s
could have up to thr i mean the buttons could ea could be up to three colours 'cause that how it's designed there
yeah
yeah
i like it like that
yeah okay
so
special form
they're all kind of just push button right
no i think they're fine
yeah
special material
material we want them rubber as well probably yeah
uh
oh do i have to do it per button do i
no i don't think so
i think they're if they're all gonna be rubber then it that's what it matters
okay
yeah 'cause it wouldn't make sense otherwise 'cause for the whole mat case material it's only one
yeah
yeah
mm-hmm
yeah
it's i mean it's two to make it rubber
okay
oh wait so maybe
thirteen point seven
oh oh
yeah what can we reduce
okay let's have our buttons all be one colour
mm i kind of like the buttons
let's see what that would do
it's only gonna bring us down to thirteen point three anyway
alright
okay um are we sure this is double curved
uh
maybe it's single curved we have no idea
we have no idea
i dunno i didn't get any pictures
it's single curved
it's single curved
why not
well it's not the yeah
okay it's the kinetic battery that's kind of expensive but we have a simple chip single curve
case material is rubber and it's a special colour but that's important
yeah
that is important
six buttons we have to have six buttons
how did it get more expensive what did you just change
it was it was thirteen and now it's fifteen
what
no okay maybe not
i don't know what just happened
now it's twelve
we
what was our target price again
twelve point five
twelve point five
hey hey
twelve point five
so we're just just about there
so we're okay i think
we're all set then
yeah
ish
okay we're all set
alright
um save
i saved that to our um our big shared folder so you know
um okay back to agenda
um are the are the costs under twelve fifty euro
yes
yes
yeah they are
yeah
let's move on to the project evaluation
project process
satisfaction with for example the room for creativity leadership teamwork the means any new ideas found
so i guess what we're gonna talk about here is just evaluating how we created this project the information we got on the news
how we used it if we were able to um you know use our creativity with the information
um how how well i guess i led it um the how well we worked together as a team um the digital pens the whiteboard
well
okay
i felt very creative
i enjoyed making the prototypes
i think we've been successful in that we've achieved almost all of the design goals that we've set and we've come up with a finished project and we just about got cost
yeah
i think we could've done even better with a little bit more information like what's a single curved case how many colours what do colours count
mm-hmm
mm-hmm
things but given given what we had i think that we did we did really well
um i think we worked together pretty well
yeah
yeah i mean if i'd had more market research on the fruits and vegetables maybe we could've taken that into account
mm-hmm
yeah
but the fruits and vegetables they really my creativity so
i know i really did the the whole mango idea was great
do you think we could
no i mean
i thought the pen was a little distracting for me personally like its heaviness and like just being so conscious of like turning the pages i dunno
that was a bit of a distraction
yeah
that was the last one like i chose not to do a powerpoint 'cause i didn't think it made sense to
so i liked that i had the option to do that and just to take my own notes and that whole sort of thing
mm-hmm
yeah
i think we all made um very significant contributions i don't think anybody dominated it which i thought was really good
like each of us was able to um like each of you had your information and i uh i tried to facilitate it without like taking over um
yeah
i like our little finished products
can we market this as the mango remote
they're funny
really cute
i kind of want one
should we have that somewhere on the packaging
i have a little r. r.
i'm trying to think of a good pun that i could add there
i know let's think of it like a little jingle
um
i like the r. r. that's gonna be etched in
yes
hopefully not with just my fingernail at some point but um it's quite a useful little gadget
all thanks to iain for the design of that one
okay um new ideas found
mm
what did we find for new ideas
people should really base their remotes on fruits and vegetables
definitely
yeah
or or at least be c p creative enough to think of toggle switches mm
i i am really into the idea of kinetic batteries now after reading about them
etcetera
oh i'm so excited
yeah i didn't even know they existed
that was
i i knew you can get watches that had them like really quite expensive watches that just never need a battery 'cause you're always moving your wrist
mm-hmm
but in other things i think it'd be really good
i thi yeah that's awesome
um okay closing
are the costs within the budget
is the project evaluated
yes
now there's the final questionnaire and meeting summary
um so this is the great product kids i think we've created something really interesting and that we have a market for it
um especially if we can produce it at twelve point three which we hope um
yeah
yeah
make sure in your questionnaire to put down criticisms of
both the process and the um the final results and
yeah real reaction
i do like the martian remote
if we could choose more than one that would be my second choice
oh that would definitely be my second choice
mm
although the tog toggle
i'm afraid i would
that's cool
let's all let's all go for the yellow
i would break it
it's cool
i would break it
it started because i wanted to have it as st as a stem and then alright so
i think i would break it
break the stem off
oh that's funny
is it started as a pear but then it started looking more and more like a martian when i put the
oh yeah it's kind of a penguin
kind of looks like a penguin like with no eye
take me to your leader
i like that it stands up
mm mm
wow maybe i should market it to some remote control company now
so are are poor little thing
that was bound to happen
oh sad
mm 'kay congratulations
um
anything else to say
nothing will come up until after our meeting's supposed to be over its all timed
alright
oh
um anybody have i got more master classes anybody else wanna like take a master's class
oh
it's really funny that you got spam in your work emails
yeah but check it out
so like there are all these like links they don't go anywhere
but all that you need to keep in mind your knowledge management
um just wanna make sure you do
no the first one that you sent like i didn't realise that it was a joke and i was like why did she send this to us
oh
it's very it's very work relevant 'cause people send spam a lot
it is
yes definitely i'm very sad that i didn't get any links to the corporate website
let's see what did i get through the corporate website
oh here you can you can view
it's just inspiration about circuit boards
you can just see what's up
wow
yeah it's it's really deep
hold on
takes a little while to get excited to load
that the excel thing is pretty cool
yes
yeah that is pretty neat
here like basically it's like inspiration basically i'm gonna give you two sentences on fashion and
i love excel it's one of my favourite programs
that kind of thing see
you didn't miss out that much
i see mm
yeah my inspiration from from last time is the in interior of a remote control being taken apart bit by bit talking about circuit boards
spongy
i learned a lot actually
mm
oh wow
i could probably take apart a remote control now if i really needed to
this one was cooler
i got a whole table and everything
now i have all about circuits and chips and transponders and i wrote it all down because i thought it would be relevant
like all the different parts of the inside of a remote control but then they're like
you don't actually need this you just need to talk about the case
that's like mine it was like would you prefer an l. c. d. screen or a multifunction remote control
and then it didn't have like any kind of table like awesome i'm glad they asked that question and didn't report the result
it's really interesting though
i i thought it was a little tricky having to hand around this thing
yeah
yeah
yeah
we had a lot of the um otherwise the technology today was kinda cool
i think
yeah
that was really neat how i got emails and
we didn't we didn't use the whiteboard that much
mm-hmm
no
no
although i don't see how we could have very l at least for me i
i yeah
if i'd gotten pictures of the different parts of the case the different looks of the case i would have probably drawn them up but
mm
'cause we weren't like voting on anything and i think usually like whiteboards are good
you know like crossing out ideas or like if we had had like a brainstorming period
yeah we could've put our brainstorming stuff up there rather than just talking about it but with only four people it doesn't really make sense
mm-hmm
but i thought we were good orally
get crazy
i think if you had a larger group
and with and with the powerpoint that we can all look at
like you can do all those things pretty much on powerpoint as that's not as necessary to have
yeah
yeah
and these might've made us more willing to like take notes than to
like write up them here 'cause we all needed them separately kind of on the whiteboards in this room
mm
mm-hmm
because we're all gonna be working in different places
yeah
we if we were all gonna stay in here all the time then having the notes up on the whiteboard would've been alright
mm-hmm
but everyone needs their own like specific notes i guess
now when you were um creating your um prototypes here did you work together or did you like do separate projects
uh we we worked together um but we were making like we sort of made different shapes and then discussed how the how the buttons might work
yeah
mm-hmm
um and how we could like improve on the on the design
yeah
so it was a bit of both really we just kind of started out by each taking a colour of clay and
just fooling around with it and i came up with that rhombus shape and he came up with the sort of potatoey
mm-hmm
mangoey shape and then just went from there really
cool
it was fun
so well done with the management i felt well managed
oh thanks
i think we did well in first of all giving our meetings the time and second we actually
it's kinda fun
we we did a good job of making firm decisions at the ends of the meetings
mm
sorry
and i
that happened to me all the time though
i know what happens sometimes is that you tend to sort of have meetings and then people sorta drift away without anything actually really being decided
mm-hmm
but i think here we got we got clear and and decisive decisive points at the end of the meetings
so that we we knew where to go on from there
yeah i was quite worried at the end of the last meeting that we weren't getting we didn't really have enough information to make firm decisions
mm-hmm
but we were able to do it regardless so
i'm not usually a very decisive person so it helped to have people say this needs to be done in five minutes
this is what we'll do
yeah
i found that we did we could have used another five or ten minutes
sometimes in the meetings
yeah for some of the meetings yeah
especially last time yeah
mm-hmm
yeah i think the last time we had a lot of information but at the same time not quite enough
yeah
yeah
you know what i mean like we we couldn't answer every single question
yeah
yeah
right
um but
and i i felt the first two meetings that i was coming in with no information and not sort of
mm
made me really like ooh i don't know throwing together powerpoint out of no no information and then last time it was like the opposite
i had so much information and so much to talk about
it was interesting what came out like later like as i was doing the when i was doing the breakdown on the agenda that they gave me um
yeah
that more points came out from your presentation even
mm
um
i'm a little i am a little disappointed that we didn't do a um something for losing the remote because that was kind of a big point
yeah
that was something like in order to talk about that we would've had to have actual knowledge about circuit boards and things like
about yeah
well the problem was even when we just were creating from the excel file
yeah
there wasn't like a option to select to somehow have it included so there was no we could be like yeah it has it included
mm-hmm
yeah
i think we were
mm-hmm
there was no way for us to have
considered the re yeah
written down that it was really there
yeah
i think we were just getting overenthusiastic with the task
well it's interesting that they
i think we really got into it i mean i got into it as the day went on and i got really like
ooh i'm designing a remote control i dunno if that's just me but
mm-hmm yeah
it was interesting though that they put that fifty percent of people say they have frustration with losing their remote and yet they didn't provide us with information to um we weren't provided with information to discuss that
yeah
yeah
i know that like people people have like things they can put on their keys that you press it and it'll beep
yeah
yeah
but i but i'm sure that would require some kind of technology that
i just don't know what it is but
i think there are some of those like infomercial remotes that have things
so you won't lose them
mm
i dunno
i mean we were talking about it and like i in my household at least
there's only about two places that the remote is ever 'cause there's only one t. v. and
hmm
there's only like three chairs
that's like saying you're never gonna lose your keys and i always do anyway
you'll lose 'em in your pocket like you just will forget that or you like put it down somewhere that like made sense and then not remember
mm-hmm
mm
there's always ways to lose things
yeah
it d yeah it depends on how organised you are personally but
yeah or like i guess what the setup of the house is too
mm-hmm
but i mean
i am notorious for losing my keys i just i guess i've just never lost the remote
i put my keys in the refrigerator the other night and couldn't find them
'cause i was putting groceries away
that's funny
oh
you you're taking stuff from a bag and putting them in the refrigerator and then go back to my room
can't get in
can't get in look all around the kitchen
definitely in the vegetable drawer
that's funny
so
i always do that leaving it in my coat and then like using a different coat
mm
yep
but i guess it's 'cause we don't carry remotes around that much
yeah
can't really take it into the other room
yeah
maybe with our little robot one we could've had him have a robot
alien pear whatever he is have a little voice like i am located
oh a g. p. s. system internal g. p. s.
oh man
here you go
we should make one that walks by itself
although if it's sitting still for too long
yes i
that really could get up and walk away
or or like some crazy like electro magnet that you push it and it'll go zoom to the t. v. and stick there
or little
or just just a wheel you know
just if you like you'd have a remote for your remote that'll
yeah
well but if you could attach them to the t. v. then you can
zoom
yeah
hmm
all kinds of possibilities
mm
okay
sorry i'm just um trying to update my minutes
i decided to you know how i sent you the email saying that powerpoint minutes will be complimentary rather than like repeating them
yeah
just gonna make i'm making full minutes so that it'll include all of the agenda and all that
oh
wow
'cause that seems a little more useful
'cause you've had like the most typing and organising to do
but i didn't have like information to sloth through either so
yeah i guess
how much of your powerpoint was already done for you every meeting
most of it mm-hmm
i added slides um i added a couple slides each time but that was about it
oh
okay
yeah i didn't even think about adding slides
'cause i would just get slides with titles on them and fill them all in w didn't even think about adding more
mm
well the thing was they would provide y an agenda with s like several points but it wouldn't have a slide for each point
ah yeah
and that's the only way i remember that i need to go other that point
i know personally when i do powerpoint that's what i do and so i had it once
even if it was just like the title of it like the three presentations and i would do your three
right
you have you have to have the slogan on it or can it just be like
the slogan on it
no no definitely not
no no no
okay good
we
'cause i was like it could go around the outside
no i don't think we need to i think the r. and r. especially if the yellow and black one
i think we just need the um the r. r. yeah
is it yellow and blue
or yellow and blue
lemme go to the web page
yeah i was just kinda going by the web page 'cause they didn't give me any clear like yellow grey or
oh i guess it is black grey
grey is better than black doesn't look so bumblebeeish
i don't really like yellow in general
hey now i understand the random like newsclippings
but it
finish meeting now
wasn't it interesting that um i thought it was interesting that our market marketing um expert did not agree with the marketing um
yes
the marketing choices you know like that was a bit of a conflict
i will i just feel like if you're really doing like a a really big market evaluation you wouldn't just have like one set of source
it's kind of an they were so not backed up it would just be a sentence like we did a survey this is what people said
yeah
s mm i dunno
people are stupid
i guess it i it sort of a grey isn't it
yellow and grey but then the slogan's in blue
well we got some grey and we got some blue buttons we're good
yeah
well we don't have the right colour clay anyway
maybe like i don't know
that could always be
well we're not sadly going to actually be producing this so
oh
if they ever come out with potato
potato mango shaped remotes
i'm gonna have to
i'm claiming it intellectual property
yeah
i can't believe a whole day is gone
i know
i don't feel like it's been that long
get sucked in
mm i haven't gotten questionnaire eight yet
are you sure i got it all head's kinda small
how're we placed in terms of the alright
okay
we're okay
guess i should probably try to sit up straight
like that
okay cool
we're good
oh i think mine's fallen off
it fell
that's why
i guess it's gonna be hard to drink coffee
mm
uh okay
ah
okay
right so i'm just gonna start this powerpoint real quick
wow
yeah powerpoint
very official
yeah well you know
yeah i kinda like this i'm kinda getting into it
right
um
so just to kick off the meeting basically um so we're working now for a real reaction this is uh so it right
just got an agenda to set out what we're gonna try to accomplish in this particular first meeting
um
we're gonna just do a quick opening and we can hopefully all get acquainted with one another um then we're gonna start talk a little bit about tool training
essentially that means getting used to the only thing that we haven't tried out yet the whiteboard
um we've got a general plan for the project how we're gonna go about accomplishing this and then just a bit of discussion close up
um i guess you know game or something um in real life um so yeah basically
i want to i'm just gonna you got of course you can discuss that
i'm thinking about um uh proposing that since we've got this weird blend of ourselves and our roles that we just don't ask don't tell
um so um if you say something about marketing right sorted um y is
you're just gonna believe me we'll go from there
exactly
fair enough
um i mean obvi if if you guys if if at the same time if you like logically if something doesn't like if i'm like we're gonna sell a remote control that's the size of this paper book you know
um you say like well that doesn't seem like such a good idea because of x. obviously go with it
i mean we'll discuss it but
i'm not gonna ask do you know that or uh yeah it seems like yeah yeah exactly so
prove it yeah okay
'cause we're what we're sort of role playing is y g yeah you're gonna tap into your own knowledge as well um
and that's the same for your when we do introductions i mean um and you talk about your background you know have fun
you know maybe you went to um
uh you know maybe i you're like in maine you went to u. c. s. b. but you wanna say you went to harvard or something like that
why not you know you can this is you know i guess we can have a little bit of fun with it
so are you guys okay with that does that seem logical
oh yeah that's fine
sure
works for me
sweet
cool
so i guess that that we're totally we're making a remote control which is thrilling um uh but the idea is that we can make something based on the whole corporate model i dunno if you guys had time to check the in real life i dunno if you guys uh checked the um uh the corporate website
right
um we've got to make something as fashionable as possible
that's kind of the corporate strategy is we're gonna try to take ordinary stuff that nobody really thinks about and try to make it nice you know like john lewis nice or you know if you go to debenham's or something
so um basically we are reinventing the wheel but we wanna try to do it in a user friendly um slick sleek kind of way
um way we're gonna go about doing that is basically at first we're gonna start on the basics
and that's where i'm gonna need you guys the user interface designers and the um um the other designer that i can't remember
the the i. d. and the u. i. d. right um the industrial designer hey right on alright getting into it um
mm
there you go
to guide me and guide us on this project 'cause you're gonna be you're g you guys are the bottom you know you're like no you can't do that you can't have you know x. and y. um at the same time
and then um we'll work up from what is necessary to more like what would be good
you know like um i i think you guys probably got the same emails i did but the idea of um
yes a coffee pot needs to be able to hold coffee but it's also better if it's not like really cheap glass so that it if you touch it you hurt your hand
or something like that
um and so we'll work up from there and um then we'll meet on and talk about it and then finally we'll incorporate as kind of the last stage you know where you guys build or tell me tell us what's possible and then you tell us what we can um hope for and what way to go take the the the
take the basics and make it nicer and then ov obviously uh the u. i. d. and the i. d. you know you you can keep on the you know sort of at the cutting edge of how to get about maximising what is possible
um to try t of sync it all up
so that's the detailed design
so it's a three stage kind of thing
um right so for now just for th the white board um
basically uh just to get used to it i haven't tried it yet either um i'm just gonna start and um mm carry like five remotes around
um and just write down i'm just gonna write down one of the names of my um desert discs you know if you if you were trapped on a desert island and you could only bring five c. d. s along with you name one of them that you could
not all five if you wanna write all five go for it but name one of them that you could um
oh we skipped introductions
nice
i'm a excellent project manager
um
i'm marty um i went to uni at uh u. c. santa barbara and i'm here working on a p. h. d. in psychology
um yeah
so
i'm sarah i went to michigan and i'm here doing cultural studies and i'm the marketing manager or something
marketing yeah expert
expert don't play yourself down
expert
fine
expert
that's me
i'm ron
i uh once upon a time studied in victoria and i am the user interface designer
i'm nathan i'm from california and i'm here doing a masters degree in social anthropology
where did you go to uni nathan
u. c. l. a.
oh brilliant
yeah
cool
my little brother goes there
okay
right so desert island discs
so
yeah
so do we have to wait for you to write it down or are you gonna tell us
well i'll t i no no yeah i'm just gonna write a couple of 'em down
i'm waiting to know
see i'm a big music fan i don't know if you guys are i'm assuming everybody likes music to some lesser or greater extent but
uh
fair enough
there's some other options if you're a t. v. slut like i am like smallville terrible television show but i happen to love it
oh smallville
it's rubbish but i love it
i went to high school with tom willing actually
t the the main c the main character
the guy
wow
yeah
is he a wanker
yeah
very much so
hell of a soccer player but a total bastard nonetheless
he looks really tall like he's gotta be like six six
yeah
he is a big guy
yeah
yeah
um okay so i really like jeff buckley
you guys heard of jeff buckley
mm-hmm
mm-hmm
um that's cool 'cause like not very many people have
um and um oh well i might as well throw a british person in there um you can't go wrong with radiohead
it's a r
good call
okay so it really works just like a pen only makes noises i think
it's kinda weird
anyway yeah
interesting
yeah you're like press and it's
kinda cool
you'll see
alright so um whoever wants to get up next you can write down some telly that you watch or whatever you want
i guess i'll go next then
go for it
right on
okay
don't wanna lose all my mikes plugged in here
okay
this is basically just pen practice huh
w
okay
oh you're much taller than me so i'm gonna write down here
um
right now i'm listening to a lot of somebody nobody's ever heard of chris bathgate local michigan folk singer really lame and uh
mm
nice
wow
uh what else did i bring with me
probably classical to totally geek it out yeah i think
okay yeah yeah
and my family guy d. v. d. s but we don't need to write that one down
well yeah
oh family guy
so yeah
isn't h has h do you watch the new season
no
are you getting it online or is it on sky
i think i'm gonna start downloading it yeah
yeah that'd be nice
alright
think i'm just gonna put down one uh one c. d.
anybody
mm mm
no
no
'fraid not
no
afro beat orchestra very cool
afro beat orchestra
yeah
very cool
mm
fift s they like fifteen members from brooklyn
sounds nice
mm
um and i'm hoping to go to the concert in belgium in brussels in april first
wow
exciting
yeah
it's supposed to be in brussels anyways
that'd be
um thing i love about edinburgh
oh
i didn't even read those
oops
i shouldn't admit that
that's what a powerpoint presentation is for
oh wow
it's they're designed specifically to ignore
i it's th brilliant
yeah
it's the five by five i can't read that much
ah yes yes yes okay i see that
vomit
yeah oh it's so horrible
yes
love um
street pizza
it's so brilliant
i've seen more urine in this city than ever before i mean
oh my god
i just came from glasgow and i'm um happy to say that there's the there's the same quantity approximately
seriously
there's more vomit there
um
it's so minging
i w
it really is
uh
does uh yeah
ready
alright
yep
minging
nice
yeah
i'm going local
slide it in there
yeah
going local
i have to be here for three years so i might as well get the terminology right
yeah fair enough
i've already got more than i can keep track of
and i'm gonna go home next week and everyone's gonna be like oh my god you're turning into one of those people no
oh have you been home yet
they'll be like say something british and you're like oh shut up family
i know
i know
uh-huh
um
oh it should be interesting
wait until i tell them i'm not coming back
let's see
right you s you're gonna stay here
they're gonna love that one
probably
or at least get a work visa for a while and then decide
wow
nice
'cause nice
bad religion
yeah that's the music i grew up listening to
of course
yeah yeah yeah
oh now i can think of so many other ones
and so there
well yeah that's why yeah
that's how it works
something i miss about my hometown
i miss coffee
burritos
mm
nice
burritos
oh
that cost less than eight pounds
any thing that are like free
oh yeah two two bucks
where are you from in california by the way
i grew up in san diego but yeah um la jolla p. b.
did you really
what part
yeah i'm from san diego as well
nice
yeah oh man
but really uh i last lived in san francisco i haven't lived in cali well i haven't lived in southern california since i was eighteen
going to s like north carol i'm sorry you you just can't get a better burrito than what's available in the s in san diego
it's different
'cause in san diego th the tortillas are cooked on the grill and in northern california they steam them
it must make all the difference
yeah it really does
well it's it's i there's other things too there's you just can't place it like i when i went to school in the u. in santa barbara which is central california
ah
the mexican food is okay it's just not good like and yeah it's like two bucks
mm
like literally two bucks for this massive i miss yeah good call on that
right
yeah
where you from in san diego
mm
um just literally just metropolitan san diego i live like five minutes from the zoo
okay
so north park actually if you want to get real specific
yeah my grandparents lived on um thirty second
yep
close t uh do you know where clare de lune coffee shop is and
yes
on university yeah
cafe forte
yeah it's actually like literally half a mile from my house
cool
yeah pretty cool
small world as we were discussing before
yeah
especially when we're all from the same general region
right so okay success on the whiteboard
there you go
you can harness the awesome power a little bit introductions we talked about some of our c. d. s and things we like about the city you know i think we'll
wow
um right so moving on to not fun stuff uh project finance
um basically what we're trying to do is sell this remote for twenty five euros
um
this is what the finance department has told me the c. f. o. but i don't know
i'm not sold on this it's pretty dear i mean twenty f that's like you know
forty bucks for a remote
it would have to pretty much like do my laundry for me
mm
um so what we can maybe work on that a later but we're gonna make a lot on it the profit aims to make fifty million euros on it
eur internationally
so um one of the things i i was gonna mention to you um you guys the designers is that um it m we probably need a rever it needs to be a universal remote control probably
okay
um so something that could do n. t. s. c. as well as pal as well as various other formats like if it's gonna control d. v. d. s but um you know i'll leave that to you guys but that's something that i i it is gonna be an international sold thing
makes sense
uh
um but we wanna try to make it for twelve fifty
so we wanna try to make a hundred percent profit on it if we can
um s right so um just to close up i'm not sure how much time i've used mm next time right project manager sorted
um
is uh we'll meet in another half an hour or so um and i'd like the um industrial designer to get ge think about what needs to be done
like what the basic function of it
um u. i. d. well yeah you right g your assignments are up there and you'll also get s assignments from in your email as well more spec specifics on what do do
um mm basic and um so i need you to tell us what um we what the user's gonna want
what they're looking for
so actually in a way you guys c maybe in our next meeting chat a bit about what the user's gonna want and what the user can have
you know like uh so
and negotiate that
yeah well it is and we'll discuss the trade offs in between um so yeah specific instructions will be sent in your email
uh
but i think that that is more or less a good place to start for now um
and as more things come up we'll have meetings and you'll get emails and so forth
um any questions before we get started
i assume that we're building a stand alone uh remote control we can't kind of build it into other uh products
you mean to like
for instance like a mobile phone or something like that
mm
hmm
sounds interesting
yeah
i don't think there's any rules about it yet
so
maybe our personal coach will have something to say about that
yeah
or or you know can we produ can we sell a remote control phone for twenty five pounds or less
well have a think about it
mm
i mean i'm i'm certainly op it seems like yeah it it seems like it's certainly do able isn't it
yep
okay
w yeah
i mean um or if we can't have a full mobile phone maybe a remote that has some other kind of useful function
mm-hmm
yeah
the clapper
no i mean no good idea good idea
we'll see what see what
maybe a remote with changeable faces like the faces that you can buy for phones
nice
i like the little cover thingies
uh-huh y i like that
yeah
hot
yeah
that's true i guess we we probably have some time maybe we should brainstorm a bit like what we wanna do go back to um
i don't really have any
let me bring up something about
our basic goals here what we want to accomplish
uh project announcement
ts ts ts
yeah
not so much
hmm
all right we'll find them we're on our own
now are we also discussing kind of our initial ideas at all here
yeah yeah let's do it let's do
s does anybody have any initial ideas
i'm gonna go ahead and take notes on this too 'cause
good idea
start your minutes
yeah i mean oh yeah right
um
so initial ideas
well it's pretty much given it's gonna be universal right we decided that already and it may be functioning for other things
yeah
as soon as you said that i was thinking like all the other things you could get a remote to do
like your microwave or your front door or like to have everything on one thing
yeah
but then i've never been a fan of those huge remotes that have like a million buttons you can't tell what they do
s smaller's better
mm-hmm
simple
yeah
but i'm thinking i'm thinking kind of p. d. a. uh design so touch screen design rather than button so that you can kind of flip around all sorts of different things
specific
okay
oh right
that'd be different
interesting
yeah that's slick isn't it
i mean like stylist yeah like a just a yeah
true
right so we got five minutes more to chat about this perfect
um so we've got this kind of an idea of a trade off between um uh size and functionality
mm
mm
um and we also
right
we want it to be munt multifunctional but at the same time if you get it to do too much you're not gonna be able to tell them apart
yeah
too confusing
it's gonna be too complicated too crowded with buttons and things
that whole yeah
i'm also gonna note for future reference this idea of um so you like maybe like an l. like a touch screen type of remote
hmm
mm-hmm
mm
possibly
i don't think one exists
an interesting option
be a good idea
needs it needs one outstanding feature to set it apart from all the other remotes
yeah
definitely
yeah all the other universal remotes
um i don't know if there's such a thing out there
i guess we could do some uh do some research on or one of us could do some research on it about whether or not there are um multi format like um you know pal
n. t. s. c. region one
right
i'm pretty sure there is
i mean i i have a friend who has a p. d. a. that he just points at his telev any television he wants and it'll figure out the the specifications of it and will control it um so i th i assume that that can be done with uh kind of around the world
okay
okay
that
yeah
interesting
awesome
okay
yeah
okay
okay
um all right
so
i li i'm liking that idea this idea of a touch screen remote with multi format features
mm-hmm
um
right
um
let's see
i think making it out of a nice material would be very important
because so many of those remotes that you see these universal remotes look so cheap and low quality
yeah
mm
yeah
keeping it nice and slick would be important
and
i don't know like there's such a problem with losing them
that adding this whole like p. d. a. pen business is only one more thing to lose so we're gonna have to be careful with what like
mm
oh
just something like keep in mind when we start actually dealing with this stuff but that would be really cool
uh let's see
um
i like the idea of the uh multi plate
yeah yeah okay
yeah
fi b like what are they called those face plate things
in in
isn't there a name for them
think they're just called face plates
are they
something uh we'll have to come up with a name patent it
i don't know
i dunno
i like
we should c we should come up with a fuzzy one as well
yeah
something really cool
leopard print or something
for those cold winter days
leopard print
um
hmm
i think it wouldn't be such a bad idea to have a like a locator device
maybe a simple button that you have on your television to help you find your remote
true
mm
but if we're bundling it unless we're selling their telly with the remote
right
mm
um
well if we bundle it as a phone then you can always call it
true
if you're not doing that then we can have something that just kind of rings from either well there used to be those whistling devices but that's a little bit annoying
true
right
cou could we not do something where like just a little lit like literally just a very small kind of thing that comes with the remote that you could place something else that you press and it makes the remote page
kinda like how on a lot of um uh cordless regular phones you have a page button and it goes could we do something like that
th
right
yeah
yeah
right
i think so
that's cool
probably
i think we could design into that
yeah
good
um yeah i think this material quality as well like i guess what we can think about what kind of um uh you know apple 's been really successful with this surgical white kind of business or this sleek kind of you know
mm
yeah
and that titanium the new silver sleek ones that's last couple of years very much so
mm
yeah
curves
mm
yeah
we do have the minimum am amount i mean we were talking finances i dunno selling a a forty pound remote would h or a forty dollar remote
twenty five euro remote would be pretty you know it's pretty expensive so maybe we might wanna trade off some of the features for a lower price
right
without without getting into that whole like you know go down to bargain store remote you know bargain store universal remote that's black and you know m massive
right
yeah
some kind of i dunno a balance there in somewhere
mm
definitely
but um have a think about what we can do have a think about what we want to do how we're gonna sell it and um
yeah
or if you our users in mind like these grandmas are not gonna be into this whole new let's design
no it's they're used to the buttons so we'll have to be careful of exactly who we're marketing this to
yeah
and who we're gonna be able to get it out of
mm
's true
but
we're talking twenty five pounds or twenty five euros
twenty five euros
euros
slight difference i guess
yeah
they're all weaker than they're all stronger than the dollar
mm
although computer parts all if you're gonna upgrade your computer buy it in the states
like um do you guys know fry's
huge computer uh electronics store
no
mm mm
they serve um right they sa tha s they will sell things overseas so you can buy stuff in america and have it shipped over for like twenty thirty pounds about
mm
right so um let's go ahead and wrap that up here for now i'm gonna put these initial ideas that we've got in the um project documents
so if you guys wa need a reminder about what we've talked about um the different you know kind of trade offs that we've got and the other ideas
okay
okay
you can consult them at your leisure
and uh right so thanks for that
let's just uh head back to work on what we were talking about bef uh goi h h getting into
with half an hour
um
yes
'kay
perfect
thanks guys
cool
thank you
alright
all set
okay
cool
right
so um basically i'm just gonna go over real quickly um some news i've just got from the board on how we're supposed to do with this um remote control
and then i'm gonna turn over to you guys to make brief presentations um on what you've found and then we'll have a bit of discussion
so basically uh what i've just found out from the board i dunno if you guys got this email as well but it needs to be television only
so no we're not doing d. v. d. we're not doing anything else it's just gonna be a television remote
okay
um it also needs to have the company colours included in it
um so that's red and black
and it has to have the slogan case you guys forget the slogan it's we put fashion in electronics
um and no teletext
i'm not sure what teletext is but i'm assuming you guys do so we don't wanna include that um in this particular design
for reasons that i don't really know
there's but it's the board so there you go
so basically um given those guidelines which will have some effect on how we design we'll discuss it later i mean 'cause it's television only we'll be able to change our uh um
well we can s sacrifice more function for a better television remote
anyway
so i'm gonna turn over to the industrial designer uh to go ahead and make a presentation on
okay
so do i unplug this bit here
gotta plug you in
oh right yeah
yep
might have to hit function f. eight but it looks like it's gonna come up
yep
cool
okay
right
that's page one of my presentation
brilliant
very nice
for your first powerpoint it's lovely
so the uh method
we're gonna have to understand how remote controls work and res uh successfully complete this project
um remote control works as follows
this is all pretty basic stuff you guys
um sends message to another system
so there's an energy source involved in that like a battery or solar power something along those lines there's an integrated circuit
which is the microchip um and that actually compose the messages and usually the way a a remote control works is it sends infrared bits to another system
a user interface controls the chip basically that's the casing and the buttons and um accordingly the messages as well
so my findings
um i just did a preliminary study here and uh i found that too much metal in remote design could potentially cause interference with the ability of the remote to send commands
and too much metal can cause remotes to behave unexpectedly by receiving false signals
um too much metal is used sometimes and people pick up radio signals and the like
and there's also the possibility of the remote catching on fire and injuring the customer just think of those lawsuits that'd be really bad
therefore i suggest primarily plastic construction
'kay
um components
just some ideas that i had um energy source
it's kinda hip to be eco friendly so i thought maybe we could do something with solar power with an alkaline battery backup
um the user interface i was since we can't use metal i was thinking maybe a high grade recycled plastic
mm
the chip um silicon based chip i don't really see any way around that we can't really be different in that respect
um the sender well i'm thinking infrared 'cause it is the industry standard
multi channel that's a word i made up i don't really know what it means
'kay
uh pal and n. t. s. c. compatible and uh probably a two hundred foot range
fair enough
'kay
uh and the receiver of course is any number of electronic devices
um but in this case it'll only be t. v. s
um personal preferences i really think that we should use plastic as opposed to metal um
the company simply can't afford this kinds of lawsuits which adm admittedly is gonna come at the cost of a certain aesthetic value 'cause we were thinking
fine
is is there a way that we can use um modern types of polymers
or mo modern types of plastics that maybe do have some kind of aesthetic value um like if a white like if we talk about like well like on the lapt on these laptops and other ones they use a a pretty nice
right
it needs yeah
you can do i is there some kind of nice colo der quality plastic that we can work with
yeah that shouldn't be a problem
um for example the plastic they have on your laptop there is something that's perfectly possible for us to do
okay okay
that's the end of my presentation
cool
great
thank you very much nathan
um if next we can have the um user interface developer go ahead and make a brief presentation that'd be great as well
s plug yourself in here
mm
um hit function f. eight real quickly hold down
mm
looks like you're in okay
is it plugged in well
there it goes
computer adjusting
th
there you go
there you go
sweet
well so
here we have a uh my technical functions design presentation
um so a few of the requirements we need here
uh we n basically need to operate an electronic device
it needs to be universal um and possibly uh operate several different types of devices although we now uh find that uh that that's no problem
yeah sorry i couldn't get that g to use before
um so some of my findings
um basically wanna send messages uh to a television set
um that would be any number of different things uh such as switch on the television
uh switch to the next channel that sort of thing i think we're all quite uh
quite uh intelligent and know know what a normal remote control does
um now some of the other things i found is a a complicated remote control sorry that we can't quite see my red there very well but uh this remote control has many functions um so it can do a lot of things but it uh it is quite complicated and most users will find it uh find that they won't use most of the functions because they don't know how to use them and don't wanna take the time to learn how to do it
oh yeah look at that
mm
mm-hmm
as you also notice it's quite a boring design
um
another remote control slightly different it's a simpler remote control uh many less buttons but uh has many fewer functions
um m much easier for the user to manipulate and use
um it also has a bit of a cheap look and it's also quite boring
so my personal preferences
nice
revolutionise the idea of uh a remote control
um so attain the functionality of a complicated device but use a simple formatted display uh for the user to to work with
and i was gonna add another uh slide here but i didn't quite have time there
okay
um
just incorporating some of the ideas that we had previously like uh having multiple face but it's uh
great
thanks for that ron
right
'kay yep that's you
does that mean i'm up
i think so
okay
i can plug you in
oh that would be perfect
thank you
slide show up and running
or not
give it a little bit
uh
oh there we go
perfect
okay
so this is me
um basically i was looking through some marketing reports that we've got and we had a usability test where we were actually sort like watching a hundred people use t. v. remotes and see what it is that they're using and then they filled out a questionnaire about what they like and what they don't about their general t. v. remote control practices
um pretty much through testing we were finding out that most of the time everybody's used to using changing the channel turning it on using the volume
m the majority of the time that's all that's going on the other functions happen
for some people they're important but the primary uses are really really basic
um and so big complicated remotes like one we saw in the last presentation are really not the general public's use
they're not using a lot of it they don't need it
they even find it frustrating when there are all those buttons that they don't know what to do with
and um we also found out that uh fifty percent of our people their the worst thing about a remote is how often they lose it
and then they can't find it in the room
so i think what we were talking about with a pager or something will really come into play with a lot of these people
um there's also a survey about what they liked about remotes and pretty much they all think they're hideous and not very useful
and the younger demographics are all really interested in voice recognition options
i don't know if that's something we're ready to look into technically that's up to the design people but it is s something worth thinking about
especially since the younger demographic's obviously the one that's gonna keep growing so if that's the direction we're headed in it's something to think about
um but basically it really is the primary functions and getting it to look nice which are
the standards
so it's a good start for us
that's great
thank you sarah
right
need to unplug this
so um yep i'll just uh switch that back here
need it back
i'll finish up with just a bit of discussion plan on for the next phase
there you go
right so i think we've covered most of these important questions through this um through you guys's presentations um we've got uh y the industrial designer suggests uh or pretty much emphatically suggested that we need to go with plastic
um sarah she's recommended that we go for simpler functions so fewer functions um but we need to decide who are we selling this to
you s your stats suggested that seventy five percent of people under thirty five wanted thought about voice control
oh right
um so do we wanna go for that or do we want to go for an older demographic
and my thought is um we've got w if we're gonna go for a sleek look i mean we are putting the fashion in electronics um
we're not catering to the pensioners of the world i don't think so
yes
so maybe this we should look into this younger demographic
um
right
so
uh we need to wonder ah h about how we make it better and smaller and faster um think we're constrained to plastics very well we've got this idea
ron was saying we need to think about uh revolutionising the way it's looking um
right
which might be easier given that we're going for simpler function and that we're only going for a telly
uh
um so um
how th this voice operation thing is i think is a good idea um assuming that it's doable
um at least for the basic controls maybe we can balance it that way you know we can see
right
mm
okay you can't say record alias tonight at seven p. m. but we might be able to say um volume up
yeah
right
i think it would be possible to uh combine the locator device and the voice recognition technology
mm
oh
that could work
i like that
with a simple command like locate
yeah
and then it could start to beep and
something very basic
right
right
therefore be found
sounds good
is that only gonna be within our two hundred foot range then
oh yeah i think that's very doable
okay
the difficulty wh would be in um i think like i you couldn't speak into the remote that you're trying to find
'kay you have something that picks up
mm
a voice from far away
yeah
it's a good point
if it's hidden under the couch but then again you have this wee this wee thing you know that's just a little chip or whatever that has the page button
maybe that could be voice activated too
a little sticky pad to stick on top of your uh television
mm
and you just say something to into that and it
yeah
yeah
yeah
finds your
k
or an isolated magnet or something like or you know something that wouldn't interfere i don't know that'd be the technical thing but yeah i like that
yeah
i like that the voice recognition for the paging system
the other thing is we might be able to handle the simplicity of a remote control and kind of put the more complicated things into a voice control
so it could be sold to both the younger market and the older market
true
and the younger market could use kind of the voi voice control method and the older market might might k exactly and might consider the older market could use the simpler design with the traditional buttons and what not
making it just an option
mm
yeah
right
yeah
i was thinking uh
are we still thinking about this screen sorry
oh go ahead
go ahead
the uh if we're gonna do this touch pad screen thing it would be still do we know if that's an option technically right now to that
mm-hmm
's definitely an option technically
okay
i've looked into uh costs of uh touch screen methods and what not
okay
they seem to be uh you know almost as cheap as a button method at this point
we're doing okay
'cause it seems like an interesting option especially because then you could have like your primary screen just be these you know four or five basic functions
okay
you can have
mm
menu options or something to have all these other complicated voice recognition settings
yeah
things that you're not gonna use every day and that a lot of people aren't gonna use but it is an option there for this hi tech market that sort of re is the sleek thing we're going for
gotta wonder though if we're adding so much technology to this one remote
are we still gonna be able to meet out twelve pou our twelve fifty euro you know goal for selling these things
mm-hmm
true
worth looking into
mm-hmm
it seems like we're not gonna be able to handle all these functions with just one microchip
yeah
mm-hmm
the microchip is probably the most expensive part of the the whole mechanism
true
okay
yeah
so it's just something to consider
okay
absolutely
mm 'kay um well yeah i guess we'll cross that bridge um in a la slightly later stages of development um but yeah i know that's perfectly viable question
mm 'kay um so i'm seeing that we're gonna just basically focus on this young demographic group aim it at them
but then in a sense that its bells and whistles are available for anybody who wants them but basically we'll make a sleek simple functioned um uh remote control
mm-hmm
um i think this voice recognition thing is a we've got a market for it uh i don't think there's too many
mm
we'd more or less be cornering the market on it as well we don't have many um
yeah
i appear to have lost my microphone
mm
right um we don't have many people or there's not very many competitors out there that do that so cool
um right
i guess we've c we've touched on most of this
the idea of a paging function a touch screen and face plates
um
the thing with i see would there not be a we'd have to maybe sacrifice the face plates for a touch screen
um i'm not sure that's sincerely correct
i think if you kind of take the example of a mobile phone that uh trying to pass a portion of the device is not interchangeable whereas the surrounding portions are interchangeable
okay
mm
okay
just the casing
we could have the casing the the face plates
okay
back to the uh the cost the material
we have to ask whether we're going to include a certain number of face plates with the package
that's something i w for say we're including three or four face plates it's gonna drive the cost up
mm
mm
and the other question is if we do include them are we really in a position to evaluate that market
yeah
we haven't done any tests on face plates and whether
right
see if there if there's even interest out there
okay
okay
right
off the top of my head it sounds kind of like a gimmick that wouldn't really go anywhere
yeah 'cause then ha you would have to who all it's not like with cell phones like where you have a you know nokia model x. and then ten people make face plates for it
mm
we'd be just our model of pho of t remote control
right
yeah
well in the publicity of a face plate on a phone is you have it out and around
it is sort of emblematic whereas you're just sit at home so unless somebody comes over to watch t. v.
mm-hmm
mm
mm-hmm
yeah
well hopefully some people have people coming t over to w to hang out at your house and most people have their televisions in the living room
true
true
true
uh
alright well we can we can discuss that one further when we think about um whether th when we do costs and so forth um
yeah
oh yeah
sure
true
if plastic is dead cheap and if we're making the whole thing out of plastic anyway um yeah we'll cross that bridge later um but yeah we will have to evaluate what's most important
um i think we've had a bit of discussion already on this thing n s there any other questions comments that came up in these presentations
well have we confirmed that we're gonna go ahead with a uh touch screen um
yeah yeah okay
interface
um
yeah i think that would be best
let's based on what sh on what you guys have all said to me let's go for a plastic
built or uh b plastic cased 'cause tha tha that's easy on the cost
try to look for some kind of high quality recycled plastic as you recommended and i think that's a great idea
with a touch screen for the basic functions
um
and we'll yeah tha let's provisionally let's go for a touch screen one with several submenus um for possible extra stuff that one basically put the channel and the on and off switch on the touch screen
um do we have
mm wait a minute it occurs to me that if we have a touch screen people are going to have to recharge their remote controls
yet at the same time that might help for this whole complaint of it being lost
true
'cause it would have a docking base
mm-hmm
but then again that costs as well
yeah
hmm
so these new lithium batteries they last twenty years even with the touch screen
do they
those new ones
okay
can we afford that
can we afford to include one of those
and will somebody buy it if we don't
well i i don't think yeah i can't see anybody buying a lap a remote control that they have to plug in so we'd have to see some kind of new battery technology
right
okay so let's go with a um touch screen
with um some kind of you know with with some kind of cutting edge battery technology
for twelve euros
yeah well hey you know well it's it's worth looking into
if not we can always default to just doing a a well presented plastic simple you know so you know
it is
fair enough
the basics
well yeah i mean you can put the we could i i dunno i mean i suppose we could put the the basics on the centre easiest you know
you know people know the channel and volume function make them large and easy to get at and then the the other the other bits and bobs you know go through menu um w we'll do the aesthetics
mm
okay so we'll touch screen and the battery focus on um uh presentation
'kay
um it's th uh with this voice recognition option as well um just as for the simple functions the um the on off channels volume um
right
and um a small paging function
even if you can't do voice recognition for the paging you know just some kind of simple button that's just a i guess another infrared signal to the remote control and while to emit some kind of paging
just a beep
okay
um right so any comments
thoughts before we break into go into the next round of individual work on this
since we're doing uh touch screen
do we wanna look into the possibility of people being able to input different types of skins for the you know the actual interface part of it and things like that
or is it just gonna be one touch screen for everybody
be interesting
mm
what what would be on that touch screen
'cause you said earlier that we have to think about company colours and um
and oh
logo or something or motto i can't remember exactly what you said
yeah the the fashion do
we put fashion into electronics
yeah
w it's my understanding that if you were going to do a skin you'd need to have some way for people to download or import skins into the remote control
right and then you're dealing with ports and cords and
yeah i think perhaps good idea but yeah i think that that one m might just be um
's too much
yeah
and they just yeah i think that one might just be out of the range for this particular a p. d. a. would they would makes a lot of sense for a p. d. a. 'cause you're gonna be using it to connect up to things anyway but
for now
i dunno what do you guys think
think we just need to come up with a nice black and red interface on the touch screen
yeah
nice
that'd be okay
yeah
uh i i'm i'm in agreement with that i'm wondering how we're gonna get uh we put fashion into electronics onto this device
um
well but if we're gonna use a touch screen where it's gonna come on like on your cell phone it'll have your your carrier provider name come up first like while it's loading and then it goes away
hmm
perhaps it could be like a temporary
mm
comes on every time you turn it on and then that's it 'cause it is a bit much to have it like engraved on the back or something i think
mm
yeah
true
i'm hoping for a subliminal maybe half a millisecond as it turns on
yeah
yeah
y
yeah
yeah i know i d it seems like it would suffice to have just the r. r. on there
mm-hmm
yeah you would think
jus
but
but apparently not
if it comes from above
people aren't gonna want their remote to boot up and to see flashing things come on
so
they just want it to be on and ready to go
yeah
yeah
well fair enough
um and yeah that would help the battery life too and if it the remote they do have to press a button for the remote to turn on
but then again who wants to turn on a remote control
well all you have to do is touch the screen and it automatically goes on
kind of if i
mm
oh to wake up okay or go into like a dormant mode
yep
goes into a sleep mode
okay
oh yeah i like that i like the idea of um putting the logo in the boot up screen nice
um
um cool so any last things before we break
alright
fair enough
we're good
sounds good
i'm gonna save th a copy of this in case you guys need any reminders
i'm gonna save a copy of this and the minutes that i'll do it in a second and put them in the shared folder for later reference
i've put my files in the shared folder as well
brilliant
yeah
that's fab guys
cool
that went well thank you
'kay
that's great
perfect
alright let me just powerpoint this up
right so um this meeting will be about the conceptual design
don't ask me s precisely what conceptual design is it's just something important that we need to do
um think of it 's kind of uh turning the abstract into slightly more concrete
in this meeting ideally we'll come to some final decisions on what we're gonna do for the prototype
um
right so um apologies for the last meeting it was brought to my attention that i did not make the roles clear enough
um so i will attempt to do so more accurately in this particular meeting
um fair enough thanks for the input 's always good
um
so basically all we're gonna do is have some presentations again much like last time um and gonna go through you
uh whoever wants to go first is f fine by me um and we'll collate what we know about um what we discussed in the last meeting possible directions
and then we'll make some more decisions on um basic uh firm up our idea on how we want this remote control to look and work
so perfect
so without th further ado whoever wants to go first is free to
i'll go first
go ahead
alright nathan take it away
it is nathan right
i'm not calling you the wrong name over and over again
no nathan's fine
good
it's either nathan or participant two
mister participant two that is
uh
nice
okay
nice
um
basically what i'm gonna have to talk to you about today is um component design and it's been brought to my attention that we may be somewhat limited as to what we can do because of what our manufacturer offers
so basically what i'm gonna be doing is talking to you about that
mm
um components of a remote control okay
we've already kind of gone over this but we're gonna have to get into more detail and probably have to reach some conclusions some time soon
energy source um our manufacturer offers a variety of energy sources your standard battery solar cells
our manufacturer didn't say anything about lithium so we might have to look if we do go that route we might have to look elsewhere
um and also there's a kinetic energy possibility
basically it's like a um the idea of moving the remote would create enough energy to keep it running
so that's one possibility but i don't know whether that would be powerful enough to illuminate a touch screen
hmm
mm
so we'll have to look into that
um the case we have a few options plastic rubber or wood
um and then as far as the way it's shaped we can do standard boring flat
which we probably don't wanna do curved or very sexy double curved
what kind of th thickness are we looking at
um i imagine that we could specify
um i don't see any reason to go outside of the convention of
three or four millimetres
okay brilliant
yeah
um the buttons there are multiple scroll buttons available from our manufacturer
but to use those we'd have to use more chips um and that would cost us more
and if we do go with the rubber doubled curved case um we'll have to use rubber push buttons because the other buttons aren't compatible with that
hmm
right
um and just a little note there touch screen equals many chips which equals many euro
right
nice
um one thing that i noticed was that most remotes operate on a infrare on the infrared part of the spectrum
so you notice when you push a button on a remote you can't see anything coming out of it but in fact there is light coming out of the remote and you know the television can detect that
and if you were to record if you were to make a video recording you could actually see the light
uh one thing that i thought might be interesting was to use part use visible light coming out of the remote just kind of as a fun gimmick
hmm
so you could actually see something coming out of the remote when you pushed it
interesting
course it'd have to be a part of the spectrum that wouldn't damage the human eye or anything like that
m maybe is there an option that we can have that off or on so a person can select like
mm
good call
choose it
yeah
i am sure that we could do that
um of course
yeah i like the idea it's a good idea
yeah just as a fun gimmick
yeah
just to set us apart a little bit
um and then on to the circuit board that we're gonna use also known as the chip
uh we really don't have any way around the t. a. one one eight three five
um findings okay we're very limited by what our current manufacturers can offer
um and my question to all of you is should we look to other manufacturies or should we just make do with what we have available
interesting question
's a bit of a challenge question
mm
well i'd say shop around but with our time constraints is that really a feasible option
yes
mm
right that's my concern too
um if we do go the lithium battery route then we'll have to go outside our current manufacturer
my personal preference is i'll just throw my cards on the table uh i think we should probably go the solar battery route
just to kinda keep with the environmentally friendly theme that we have going on
uh i like the idea of the visible light signalling
that's something to set us apart and uh i was thinking about i was thinking of ways that we could produce the remote in a variety of different case materials to suit different tastes
so we're not so confined by one style and say some you know
right
say our the one if we just go with one and it doesn't go over well then we're in a bad situation
mm
right
can we do marketing piloting too
try to see what kind before we launch can we see how they're received
um
it's an option
uh but actually there's i've got some research already on like what we're looking at and trends in casing right now which actually might even come into play beforehand
okay
okay
okay perfect
it may help us decide for now
great thank you very much nathan
temporarily anyway
oh yeah you're welcome
that's perfect so i guess that makes sense for you to take it from here
i guess so 'cause i found some interesting things
did you
you waiting for me
fascinating compelling even
i know what a teaser ain't it
um
right
so current market trends
screen
um basically i was looking at what's going on in the remote control market right now and what's going on in other design fields
to see sort of what's what's trendy what's new what's happening
um remote control right now basically everybody says they want newer fancier more exciting they're sick of this boring
normal functional um that we need innovative design options and there needs to be an easy user interface
um the challenge is that current trends right now across the board in fashion in furniture
in technology is a very organic fruit and vegetable kind of thing
now i'm not saying we should have you know tomato shaped remote controls or anything
but i think it is possible maybe to use um natural colours like if wood is an option that whole organic sleek clean
mm
v line thing may be something we can look into
different skin options or if we can't afford this touch plate thing or touch face screen interface um
maybe having the b images be specific like you could choose your menu bullets to be
tomatoes
a different shape or okay not the example i would choose
but you know what i mean to t sort of and th apparently the feel of the next couple of years is spongy
mm
uh not something i i've come up with a though if we can get around to getting piloting i thought maybe a casing option like uh
i like it i like it
not like a skin but like a holder almost if you could do like um leather options or wood options or something
hmm
i should have mentioned this um
as far as the rubber that we can use we can use a rubber as part of the case it has a consistency of those stress balls
mm-hmm
yes
mm
might be an interesting way to go
fabulous
slick slick
um yeah so something to sit on for now
so overall i think we should stick with what we're finding everyone's looking for easy to use
technologically innovative and this fancy new i think perhaps the double curve thing and maybe this rubber option is our best way to go for right now
mm
um
interface oh the interface graphics for the um
yeah
um
well i d but then if the touch screen thing isn't gonna work out for us that's really a non issue
yeah
i like the idea of of rubber too because it's tends to be associated with being durable something that you can drop and it doesn't matter
mm
true
'cause so many you go to so many houses these days and you see broken remote controls
very true
yeah it's like yep it's ubiquitous isn't it
very true
taped with duck tape and what have you you wouldn't have that problem if you used rubber
very much so
um
we can have a duck tape casing
we could
i think that goes against the whole fancy something a new line but worth a shot
it could go with the granola crowd
ah it could be it could be um
yeah that's what i know
great thanks for that sarah
no problem
ron
phew
computer's adjusting
one moment please
so interme interface concept by your faithful user interface designer
so yur user interface guys is basically aspects of a computer system that we can see or hear or otherwise uh perceive
uh commands and mechanisms that basically user uses to control the operator operating system
here's a d series of different remote controls that are out on the market today
i think we're definitely trying to get away from this kind of a look
yeah
um so
the following are a bunch of different uh interface uh concepts
uh voice recognition we we um actually have some new uh information from our research design team but uh i'll get to that in a moment
um so current voice recognition starts up to about eighty speech samples
um and basically you record your own verbal labels c and connect them to the remote control
now our design team research team
has been able to uh set up a system in which uh you can teach the remote control voice c recognition system to respond to um with standard responses
like you could say good morning uh remote control and it'll say in a sexy female voice good morning joe
um
in fact we already have this for a coffee maker line
mm
lot of single people on the um on the re on the remote control research team at the
on the remote control right
yeah
very true very true
um another concept is what uh apple has come up with
the spinning wheel with uh l. c. display like on the uh ipod which i am sure most of you know about
mm
mm
um and then we have the scroll button with integrated push button kind of like a modern a bit bulky
mm
mm
a bit crazy i don't think that's we're necessarily going for
no
and uh some special components uh ideas like uh blocking
having the ability to block channels from your for your children um and uh dedicated buttons for for commonly used uh channels and even uh ideas like secured or hidden programming but uh i again if we go with touch screen i don't think that's a big issue
um
and uh this is kind of the uh the big daddy of remote controls here
hmm
uh the jumbo universal remote control is almost impossible to misplace or lose
yeah i can see
um
again probably not what we're going for so i i mean my ideas here and kind of where i think we're heading is something slightly larger than a regular ipod uh with a hard cla c uh plastic casing although i think some of the suggestions we've come up with are definitely uh very good ideas
okay
uh changeable casings uh our design team was possibly talking about including one extra face plate with the package to kind of set the idea that you can change it and you can try changing it and kind of get used to thinking about maybe buying another one which can add value to our uh bottom line
mm right
uh touch screen interface um possibly having go to buttons being uh stuck into the system so those don't move away from the screen
uh the important ones like power volume and jump between channels
um
and of course our voice command system which i've talked a little bit about already and uh the use of recognisable colours and shapes to aid recognition of the features um that are around so
mm
red for power um arrows for different volume ups and downs and channels ups and downs and what not
mm
and uh perhaps even adding in some stupid little jokes with the voice recognition idea like perh mm for instance my toastie maker that i got from my bank
has jokes when it's ready
nice
great
and uh that is about it
great wonderful ron cool
lot of good ideas good facts to have
mm
that's what they need it's like a little dongle it just sticks up this further so you don't have to stand up every time
just connect it my kingdom
yeah
mm
right so good to know all that stuff thanks guys um
now we kind of have to come to some decisions um
i figure we can just go down the line and all three of us can have a chat about it
um
based on what nathan presented as far as the um various costs and benefits um i think
i dunno what do you guys think about the touch screen at this point
i think it's our most marketable feature just because it's so new and it's something that is showing up in other places
'kay
'kay
but can we really afford it 'cause it looks like they would be that would be a really main cost source then right
mm-hmm
my estimate is that in order to incorporate touch screen technology it's gonna cost us upwards of seventeen fifty euro per remote yeah that's just an estimate though
to produce each one
per
piece
oh you guys are always the dampers on these projects
i know
mm
you industrial designers
i know
hmm
it's fun
and our goal was to be under twelve fifty or we have to be under twelve fifty
well
do we remember
i thought there was some flexibility with that
okay
there is it's just it is a question of and how much ca o does that mean we're gonna have to increase the price to make money
can we justify it
um from twelve fifty if we d wanna get our fift uh hundred per cent profit margin um that would mean selling it from twenty five
if you multiply seventeen fifty by two that's thirty five
right
so
where do you guys come up with these numbers
that's just off the top of my head it is pending further emails
from the board um well
right
though i think that's what people would pay for i mean if you're gonna pay for an expensive high class remote you're gonna expect it to do something
that's true i mean
it is the new it would be in a class of its own
yeah
and that's to be fair the um the per cent of the market we're not going for mass any you know
mass sales anyway we're gonna make i mean we we're not talking about selling eight zillion of these things
we just couldn't not for twenty five euros so
right
we could probably maybe shrink the profit margins rather than selling for twenty five sell 'em for thirty but that's something that we can have finance deal with
yeah
um i say that we provisionally go with the touch screen or wh y wh what was your thought on the matter ron
i'm thinking that's uh definitely a good idea and i also think that we could probably come up with some sort of a cheaper uh means to to go about this kind of production
see if we can cut some corners
my my team in the uh on the third floor suggested that uh
right
well and we can look into this other manufacturing option and maybe we can get 'em somewhere else cheaper
mm
yeah
it's true
we could initially go with what we have and if we can find them cheaper later on
right
it's a starting point anyway so
no we could have a s very simple touch screen you know there's always the opportunity
if it's gonna be about the size of the ipod or whatever you know w we yeah i guess we can play around with it a bit
alright let's let's say that okay so the touch screen will be our um our main selling point here
mm
so
i mean i think that we really have two main selling points i think that our casing and the voice recognition
yeah 'cause with voice recognition
i mean really this is pretty bells and whistles kinda remote
the voice rec thing i mean if if we're looking at bottom line
yeah
now we're looking at upping the cost to seventeen to get the touch screen on i think we might have to drop the voice rec
i think we'd have to decide between 'em definitely
yeah
to be honest we have the capa we have the design in house
price wise
i mean we've we've come up with this with this new voice we're using it for our coffee machines already
true
we've already got it
i can pass you on that email from my uh guy in uh guy down the hall
sounds good
hmm
what do you think on it nathan
about the voice rec
i think if we we do both the obviously production costs are going to go way up um but it does put it into it'd become the rolls royce of remote controls basically
pretty much
it would be very nice
i mean we we have to r reflect back on what our market research did say
right and they said they wanted voice recognition
course maybe they hadn't thought of this whole touch screen option
but definitely we know the market is there for voice recognition so to say we have the technology and we're not gonna use it even though we know it'll sell
is a call i don't think i can give the highs ups
mm
like really i can't go in and say no we're gonna just ignore everything we know
yeah
does having both really up our costs
i can't see how it wouldn't i mean there's you know the old aphorism you can have it fast
you can have it cheap or you can have it quality pick two of three
you know you can't you can't have all three
yeah
yeah 'cause you you just upping the number of chips that you need to deal with each different function
it's just impossible
yeah
well if we're gonna pick betwe e alright so we have to pick between one of the two
um
otherwise yeah we just it just becomes cost prohibitive
what which which do we suspect we should hold o we should hold on to
well we already have research backing voice recognition as you know
fiscally solvent
but uh i i i personally would tend to another direction but if that's what's gonna sell i think that's what we need to go with and maybe we can table this touch screen for our next model
i would have to side with that i think the voice recognition is simpler
'kay
we already have the all the technology in house it's ready to go it's packaged it's
what does the cost look like ron
is it cheaper to do the v. r. or to do the uh touch screen
well my p is
nathan
mm
um this is just off the top of my head keep in mind
but i think the voice recognition would they're both mm they're both gonna push the costs up
but um
since we already have the technology in house for the voice recognition we're not gonna have to do as much design work and sometimes the design work is what push the costs up
mm
right
right
if you know what i mean
right
um i definitely have to agree with that last comment
and we're still not then we don't have to deal with this battery issue nearly as much either we can stick with what we've already got
mm
in a lot other ways too
okay
so i'm getting alright so more or less you guys think that o o of the two of 'em the voice recognition will be better
okay
i think it's our lower risk option which for right now we can have it on the market sooner which is all in all our best option
yeah
okay
sorted
we will omit the touch screen in favour of voice recognition
it's you and me outside a little here
so and when are we gonna have basic prototypes coming up next that's you guys's next step right
yeah well we'll we'll sic we'll sort out what it what f what else we're gonna talk about for the prototype but yeah that's our next step
yeah
right
it'll be a developing of prototype
okay
are we going to talk now about um the materials that we're gonna use for the case and all those things
yes
mm-hmm
we'll just run through it yeah yeah um
okay
you discussed either a lithium or a solar power
would the solar power be enough to fuel a voice recognition
or this kinesthetic one would that be enough to fuel a voice recognition remote control
um the solar power definitely would be but i think just to keep people from getting annoyed
'cause sometimes solar power fails and there's no way round that we should install a small backup battery
mm
yeah
just to cover those moments when for whatever reason the remote hasn't been exposed to
well what of people with like the t. v. in their basement like what if wha we can't guarantee sunlight everywhere so having a secondary source is probably
mm
yep
it's true
yeah it works about the same as a solar powered calculator and you know how those those don't really require that much light
calculator
yeah
true
true
um but obviously a little more light than a calculator but we're not talking about a lot of light
doesn't have to be out taking a sunbath for a few hours a day or anything
right
right
okay
okay
what do you think ron
i'm willing to agree with everything that's been said
okay
uh i have to say though that um another idea's come up in my head
if we're really not uh handling the remote control to a great extent we could possibly get away from the idea of having a hand held remote control and maybe kind of have a round remote control that kind of looks like a paperweight or something like that
kind of a sleek little uh neat thing that sits on your table or something
uh
hmm
hmm
interesting
yeah
why why moving away from hand held why
just a thought
what's the uh idea
well if you don't need to pick it up it could kind of be a selling point
i if it's got voice recognition it can be technically anywhere in your room and still do its job
hmm
do you think people that are people that buy a remote are they always gonna wanna use the voice recognition or is it just something that they do sometimes
true and i probabl i think we're banking on selling it to more than just voice recognition people
like we want it to work fundamentally as a basic manual too right
well we have to have buttons on it too as well
but that's done
that's no bother i mean if you look at the catalogue from places like with sharper image or whatever you know they might have or like um who is it
apple makes these really pretentious speakers with the th sub woofers you know like clear and glass and you know and then they got these little pyramidal type of um speakers
mm-hmm
right
yep
yeah
i mean why not have a little rounded kind of thing it could still have the basic buttons on it
um 'cause we're going for basic functionality primarily as well
with the bu yeah
and maybe a menu button and so forth
you know um use a channel button to scroll through the menu d if they want to record programmes or whatever you know i mean we can sort that out
i think i think you're on to something because we need to escape the traditional shape of a remote
mm-hmm
yeah
maybe something that looks nice on a table is would be good even though and hand held the same time
true
way to go
i think it's all about following apple's lead on a lot of these things
yeah i'm thinking of the airport portal you know like that little pod looking thing
mm-hmm
mm
yeah those are nice
exactly
yeah
i mean a nice although we do um wh uh is i'm recalling that she mentioned that we n need to get away from the surgical white kind of brushed aluminium thing and get back to it but you could have a very tasteful um wood coloured or earth tone kind of um
right
mm
that would be kinda neat
terracotta bowl or something
still i mean yeah along those lines
mm
yeah i like that i like that idea a lot
um let's see what we can do as far as that goes
okay
and the uh the material like the plastics and so forth we were discussing that being uh using like a rubber kind of softer feel
mm
um you know li lik if you feel the the tip on this pen it's a bit gives just a bit
yeah
you know something where it's uh a a more advanced f form of plastic that has some kind of a tactile response to it
right
just kind of the squishy feel
yeah which is the next big thing so that's not gonna hurt us either
mm 'kay
yeah let's see if we can do a squishy non remote control looking remote control
but to be fair yeah i mean
you just c you could just put it literally put it on the the ni the coffee table next to the telly and say volume up
right
yeah i like it i like the idea that's good
handy
um and we've sorted of discussed costs um
i guess we'll a that's gonna be uh a thing if we run a bit over budget that might be okay um
sorry about the uh lack of information on cost i just haven't been provided that information by our manufacturers and i'm just having to guess
okay
we'll have more of an idea when the prototype
have more of a we'll have more of an idea later on
um
and we just yeah go from there
um so we've revisited the touch screen and more or less ruled that out um
i think so we're more or less con we wh wh we're more or less in agreement that we want to have a um a simple kind of function
you know not too complex
mm
right
well when the majority of people are only using the most primary functions on a daily basis
although i'm not saying we should completely rule out major functions they should be secondary at least if not functionally then visually like those shouldn't be
right
like maybe have menu things
take precedence yeah
if
if we're not going the touch screen route then we can um just incorporate maybe something that folds out like what you often see on these kinds of remotes is the most basic functions up here and something that slides down to reveal the you know more complicated things
right
mm
and they slide
yes
well and do we wanna consider like an ipod screen which isn't a touch screen but you're still scrolling through menu options in p
think then we're hitting our cost issue again
true we're still not making it easier then
yeah we've also got the the me the thing of if we're gonna have a non remote looking remote how do we yeah
yeah
true
fair enough
b but no i mean we could do a slide or a compartment you know
like if it say it's a lit little vaguely ovoidal type of thing it'd be easy to have a compartment in there
yeah
or you know
a b a b a a series of you know three or four buttons with a menu button and then a side an s up and down type of thing
like on um like on a d. v. d. player
you know you see the modern d. v. d. players'll just have um a menu button on the side and then four buttons around them and you can just kind of manoeuvre through the menu like that
mm-hmm
yeah it's just a scroll
right
yeah
so are we gonna are we talking we need to figure out what kind of buttons we're going to use are we going to use scroll buttons
rubber buttons
um
well it seems like i dunno it seems to me that we could just do the um stick with the rubber 'cause since we're probably gonna be using some kind of um rubber for the outside case we might as well stick with that um
yeah
probably
right
i think to a certain extent we have to stick with uh kind of uh a little bit traditional in terms of the buttons and then and then make our unique feature our casing and what not and our voice command
right
mm
well no it's basic just like four directions that are that can use as menu or channel and volume or however you wanna do it
are really versatile and everybody's already got them to some extent on the remotes they already own so it's not like we're dealing with everybody relearning things 'cause that's not something anybody's gonna wanna buy a new for
right
mm 'kay um
we've already kind of covered this as well
that seems to be selling um and we we've more or less agreed that we want to kar target this youth market um
mm
especially now with eighteen to thirty five year olds being such a large quantity of the population
right particularly in technological fields so that's exactly where we're headed
mm-hmm mm-hmm
okay
um
yeah alright well
more or less covered what we need to cover i think fi an an any final thoughts before we think about doing the protot moving on to the prototype
well what are we actually doing
right
what were
i was just gonna step on to um i wasn't
uh
oh it wasn't in the way but yeah whatever
oh my bad um sorry
no don't worry about it
the um yeah okay i was just gonna assign tasks in the next b anyth any oth any other final thoughts before we go ahead and cool
sure
okay
yeah
so have we decided that we are gonna go with different style cases for different people
or are we just going to go with one
um
yeah
yeah
right
well then again colours wouldn't be so hard to do you could have uh a you know a um uh kind of a natural wood colour
there's an idea
like a stained wood and um i don't know olive green or something
mm
yeah
that wouldn't be so much of a problem to incorporate into the colour of the thing
and again copying imac's kind of for ipod mac apple's uh colour scheme
yeah get in there
yeah totally
yeah i think that's probably a good id okay so let's work on uh multiple case colours
but yeah stick with the same kind of kinda yeah the same basic non remote kind of remote design
cool
alright so we'll have the next meeting about half an hour um
i want the uh i'd like nathan i'd like you to work on just the basic look and feel what can we accomplish
um given these parameters that we're just gonna sort of have this kind of uh non remote remote
um what are our broad constraints before we deve design a prototype
right
and um ron if you can
figure out how probably best to lay out this idea of this simple design with the voice recognition built in and also this kind of drop down or s on the side kind of menu options simple
somehow work out how we can get this all s in the same place
um and if you can check product evaluation with m some pilots and stuff
um i need you guys to work together on making a prototype um using um prototype building materials um
and also um specific instructions will be sent to you by your coaches as well
oh excellent yeah
so that's what to start with for now is that alright you guys feel clear about this
cool
that sounds good
fabulous
alright
i guess we'll just hit the bricks
thanks guys
cool
okay
oh i totally
yeah 'cause i moved it
's put it over here
then we don't have to worry about it
ready for this
all set
cool
alright it is powerpoint time
i've done more powerpoints in this particular experiment than i've ever done in my life before this experiment which is kind of fun
yeah
oh man
so uh here we have our detailed design meeting where we will um look at the prototype and um right so um
i finally figured out what this whole second bullet point is about in my that my coach was sending to me
it means i'm supposed to read the minutes from the previous meeting
oh really
okay
i think
huh
i don't know
otherwise it's just saying i'm the secretary and i'm therefore i'm taking the minutes
s so just to go um just real briefly to go over minutes from last meeting
uh i will open them slowly no
wait for it wait for it
yeah that's not you
no
that's how the
wait
this is this is very high powered stuff here double clicking there we go
so um basically the moral of the story from our last minute uh last meeting was that um we that we had meetings from uh we had presentations done by the industrial designer
uh or from nathan and ron and from sarah about what we can do here um and what
sort of limitations we're operating with um uh excuse me what limitations we're operating under
what kind of risk we'd be looking at with some of the various approaches we were discussing and we essentially came to the conclusion that we should develop a remote with uh voice recognition
i. e. that had a vaguely non remote like shape um because you didn't really need to use it as a remote since you could just use your voice
that would include some mostly just the simple design features for a television operation but with a slide or a fold out bay for more advanced functions for users
um and uh the uh uh the u. i. d. and the i. d. were asked to go ahead and start developing a prototype for us to look at
so
that's sorted back to the main
meet here um go ahead and take it away guys
well
uh we have assembled our prototype um
what's to be said about it
um we took into account a lot of the things that we went over in the last meeting um
some of the most important things to consider are that we decided not to go for the touch screen which you can see and opted for some very large buttons for the primary functions
mm-hmm
um
this is going to be the on off button and we have these buttons to go through the channels um and then two volume buttons down here
d uh we decided those were the most important uh buttons
and then for the more advanced uh functions there is a slide out panel here um and you can see that there are lots of other things going on
but this actually can slide back in and provides a very nice aesthetic when it's all put away um
as far as the uh whole visible light thing we decided to go with the multiple colours coming out why not
ah
nice
fair enough
of course if that's annoying for some people that function can be turned off
perfect
um
no it's important to we talked a quite a bit about uh you know the the interchangeable uh faces and what we've done here is come up with a bit of a natural look here um f we call it fruity if you will
go ahead
mm
right
appropriate okay
um
right um
of course that's uh interchangeable and uh i think it would be desirable for the uh for the regular product in the in the in the in the first packaging to be something a little bit more subdued but this is kind of something that can be done um and as you can see on the television there uh we have the uh voice detector device um on the top there
mm 'kay
it is an option
oh right
that's this here
ah
um
i see
so that that will work quite well with with regard to finding this uh contraption
um what other things do we see here well um if you give it a touch it does have actually a bit of a spongy feel
um so i think that will work well with regards to our market
um and uh let's see well clearly there's gonna be some more colours and what not available
um uh do you have anything else to add to that
um i worried about the materials it is uh the entire thing is covered in a rubber coating so it's very durable uh
it's not gonna break like some types of plastic that's dropped
um and of course as you can see and if you touch it it does have that nice squishy feel
it's actually important to note that the television uh you know if there's an earthquake or anything like that that i it actually is edible inside
fact i dunno if you noticed but i wrote the uh the company's name on the telephone screen i thought that was kinda nice
oh well done yeah yeah oh ok
nice
this was actually an apple on the inside
do we need to worry about um rot factors
this
um it's encased in a new uh type of uh
oh okay there's preservatives involved we don't need to worry okay
polymer yeah
yeah
it's fine
we got a bit ahead of ourselves i know we're not talking about making televisions at this point or anything like that but
hmm
fair enough
edible televisions it's a wave of the future
no but
it's a couple years off at least
it's pos a possible new product
okay
um but i think that's i think that sums up the main features of our of the remote
um i dunno if you guys have any questions or f whether that uh whether we need to worry about any uh other marketing areas or anything of that nature
brilliant
right
um did we come in under budget
uh we did yeah
this cost well to put this into um production we're looking at about what was our goal
it was twelve fifty euro um and this actually came in at about eleven ninety nine
um so i was quite pleased with that
mm-hmm
one thing that we didn't do um obviously we had a choice with the buttons whether to use scroll buttons or standard rubber buttons
but we just went for a classic rubber button and um since we did that we didn't have to use as many microchips which was quite nice and that's what helped keep the cost down
mm
brilliant
so even though it has a lot of modern technology um for example the voice recognition
mm
in a lot of ways it's just a simple remote and um i think if we shopped around for other manufacturers um we might be able to get even cheaper
okay
mm
did we talk about the voice recognition uh option
and
oh no we haven't talked about that yet have we
so uh so uh yeah on the back here you all noticed this area here which is actually the voice recognition uh uh console and uh i think it's nicely designed into the into the overall look
okay
yeah
um but basically the voice recognition uh incorporates um the latest designs that our research team has been able to cufw uh come up with
basically uh quite similar to the coffee maker um design that we were talking about earlier and um
mm 'kay
i think that uh has given a proven um ease of use and what not
hmm
yeah
and uh allows features like the remote actually talking back to the user um so
right
cool
any questions
do we have um other for lack of a better word skins
no no i think that's
covers
in play now or are those ones gonna be developed later once we see how the couple we have g go or
um do you wanna answer this one or do you want me to answer it
do we know where we stand on that yet
well we didn't quite have enough material uh
oh i wasn't expecting a prototype i just didn't know if you guys had any in mind yet
yeah yeah
oh i see right um
um well as you can see this is just a most superficial layer and um it'd be very easy to put another layer of something else like
okay
just veneer really yeah
right
okay
actually this bottom red ring here just unclips and then you put a a new a new uh a new plate on top of that
mm-hmm
and the whole thing
okay
right
so i mean there are i we definitely priced out a spongy even spongier non natural look um materials which i think worked out fine
yeah
there's
okay
we also continued on with the ideas that f following uh apple's colour schemes with the kind of the uh light orange and the green
mm 'kay
okay very cool
it's not it's not quite a a face plate
it's more like a pseudo face plate because it's simple enough that in the factory it could we could very easily put a different one on it
okay
it locks into place such that you know it's pretty permanent but at the same time
if we wanna go the other way it's just a matter of a couple of adjustments and we could go the face plate way if you know what i mean
okay
yep
it's still an option if we need it
yeah
very cool nice job
right yeah thanks guys that's very very good work
i like it brilliant
um what we need to discuss now is the finance of it um i got me you've got you provided a number that actually sounds quite nice
um the trouble is i was just given this by finance
um it's a spreadsheet of the parts and i've just tentatively put in what it's going to look like um
oh
ooh
i'm just gonna clear this out real quickly but it looks like
so we'll just if we can just itemize what's in here we've got this it's a solar cell thing right
right uh we didn't really touch on that but it it's in there yep
with a back up battery
with the ba okay
um and
the voice recognition area actually doubles as uh as the solar cell area
clever clever well done
yeah
um so i guess that would mean we've got a bit of a um
it's a s a speaker and a sensor at the same time isn't it
yeah yeah
it's just making use of the same space and the same materials but
mm-hmm
okay
um and the case it's more of a single curved case i guess would be that be the general
yeah one big curve i guess you could say
mm-hmm
um and we've got a rubber skin material basically throughout
um
push button interface
um with this other drop down so maybe we've got two push button interfaces don't we
yeah mm-hmm
um
and um a special
i guess it's uh we've got a sort of a wood materi a rubbery type material that throughout yeah
yeah special
and s i guess you have to mark special colour and special form as well don't you
'cause it i it is very unconventional i like to think of it as unconventional
yeah it's it's quite unique
i like it yeah it's
so it looks like
m come in at sixteen
a bit over budget um
oh
huh doesn't match up does it
so what we could do perhaps a simple fix would maybe to switch away from the solar cells
um or take out the back up battery
how do you feel about that
uh
i mean i think that uh if we're talking about it being one of our main selling features being environmental and without the batteries and what not
although it does still have a battery so i'm not sure that you know what the sell is on that
yeah
i mean we could take we could take the battery out of it you see and it'd probably work ninety nine per cent of the time but you're gonna have to set up a call centre for that one per cent of the time when people are calling and saying oh look my remote isn't working what am i gonna do
mm-hmm
mm k
mm-hmm
people'd be real upset
i think in the long run it's better to keep the battery
true
it's hard to scrap the whole cell battery idea 'cause that's so integral to the theme that we have
hmm
what's difficult we have all these things integral to the um to the design of it that we just can't back out of now
nah
it would have to be seems like we'd have to go back to
square one
in a way
um if we were gonna try to undo one bit we'd probably have to undo most of it um
yeah
although we don't wanna get rid of the whole environmental i mean obviously the solar cell is a big piece of the way we're marketing this as like a natural
new thing but honestly if we cut that one piece out we're actually coming in under budget if i've done my math correctly
hmm
i mean you might be able to sway me on the idea that we our main selling point could be already this voice recognition thing i mean that's what sets us apart right
i mean
which it's yeah that's what setting us into this young market i mean that's where we started from so
i don't know
and i mean you know perhaps when the cell technology comes down in price we can bring that back into the game but it looks like at this point that may be out of our league
and the reality is you know for me from an ideological stand point i'd like to stick with the uh the solar cell
right
but i h kind of have to throw myself in the in the business structure model here and uh you know i think i think that i think that we need to come to a compromise here and maybe move ahead with the project
right
yeah
right
it's either or
yeah
without the solar cell
yeah
i think unfortunately that's our best option
i guess we might have to do that
it's the only way we're gonna get below our uh goal isn't it
mm
of twelve fifty
'cause we can't remove the push buttons 'cause they're um and we can't get rid of the uh i mean removing the changing the case wouldn't be so much of a
it kind of yeah
yeah
savings
mm mm um nor would changing the case materials
mm mm
um
so yeah that looks like to be the only thing
yeah
so that would be the it's a major change but
yeah
gotta do what you gotta do
alright so we're in agreement on that
unfortunately i think we are
no i think that was a good compromise you brought forward sarah
right
moving along swiftly
um so i guess now we just go to the project evaluation
which i will allow sarah to take over
that would be me
um cord
ah of course sorry
no problem
whoosh
can you reach that would be great thank you
yep
that'd be great
i didn't even do that one on purpose either damn
okay um
basically i was just evaluating um from what we know of how our product's working right now with the criteria that we set at the beginning of these are the things we needed to do
these are the things that look like we feel they're important
um so i was looking at basic design things does it fulfil its functions as a remote
is the design what we wanted it to do
i are technologies up to where we hoped they would be and does it fulfil the aesthetic qualities that our original market research was looking for
um
basic questions like you know does it turn on
does it respond to voice recognition
and overall in general it looks like it's coming up to par
mm
um the only thing is with with the pull out panel that is can it take some adjusting because it's a new sort of interface
um that looked like it was coming up rough but then once you get used to it it does make a lot of sense
so i think overall we're headed in the right direction
really good
so
they like that spongy feel
yeah
it looks like it's going over well so
and the paging function works well that's good to hear we worked hard on that one
six
we're we're good yeah
we did
yeah
it's i think eventually if we do um branch out with this product maybe we do have a higher budget options and if it goes over with this model we can look into um wider range voice recognition like from other rooms of the house and stuff
but for now what we've got is working in the range we need it for so it's all good
brilliant
i am bit disappointed about losing the solar panel but it's okay
that's everything from me
hmm
yeah
mm
yeah it is a set back but
okay do you need the cord back
w we might have uh we might have lost that granola market again that we're
um yeah i was just go on
i know
well they don't own tellys anyway do they
i guess that's true
true
right
so um this one's a bit unclear to me to be perfectly fair um
i got this slide from the coach and i'm not sure what it's connected to
um so i guess we are going to discuss um our project process um and that is gonna go into my report
so i guess this is the point where we go um uh out of role it looks like and talk about our satisfaction for room for creativity and so forth and how that all worked
okay
i guess um
as in within the team or
i think so yeah
right so it's just kind of a open mic kind of thing or
okay
i think it's
i mm-hmm i think so
'kay
i think hope i'm not screwing up an experiment
it is now you're in charge so there you go
but i trust that she would jump in if i was so okay fair enough
yeah
whatever
um right um so any thoughts
are we considering these points here
um
yeah
okay
i think they're starting blocks yeah
what do you guys feel about the process
um you know i think in general for a day's worth of work we actually were relatively productive
considering the little amount of input we had going in
mm-hmm
um and the technology has definitely been a help it's really been interesting to try out all this new stuff
we didn't use the whiteboard at all
no we didn't
no
no no whiteboard
we could now if that'd make up for it but really and i feel like if you guys had been designing in here perhaps that would have changed but because of room constraints
and
doesn't really matter
um also had i not been intrigued about the pen i don't think i woulda used it at all i didn't write barely anything
yeah i think i was taking notes more often than usual just 'cause i liked the pen yeah
yeah it's true
uh
mm
was pretty cool tack though
yeah
mm
definitely
i am disappointed i didn't get a note back from my personal coach
as you write your personal coach
yeah but i didn't get a response so we'll see
what if you get a response two or three months from now
okay that would be kinda creepy
that'd be weird
attempts to contact coach ineffective
well what kind of coaching is that really
what if i really needed something
i so i don't n i think there was a lot of room for creativity
we could do whatever basically what we wanted until the budget came down on us um
i think so
and even then we did get a decent product turned out although it's not everything we wanted it to be
yeah
with the natural look
that's very natural
very natural look
organic really
that's the brilliance of they had a p they had a peeler in here
and highly resourceful team mates might i add which is always a plus
yeah
yeah i think yeah re i thought it was like really creative actually i mean
i think the teamwork was good as well
mm yeah i'm impressed
and to prove that we weren't wasteful we didn't waste a single bit of play doh we used every bit
nice
all four of those little containers
including the s the multi coloured wave pattern
yeah i guess
my one my one criticism is that we didn't have enough colours to work with we only had four wasn't enough
yeah
you could have developed multiple skins really had you had more colours
i know it could have been amazing
oh well
what did you guys think about the the the roles
hmm
they were good
yeah it's f kind of fun it was
yeah
i think it was pretty clever 'cause we were never able to get too far off track because the information came in at the right time and kind of filled in the gaps enough
true
at the same time you had enough room to kind of just make things up which was kind of fun
do your own
though i did feel like th the level of information dropped off severely over the course of the day
yeah
i mean maybe it's just me but i didn't actually get any information for the last presentation at all
that's true i i got this spreadsheet
nothing i didn't even get an email like that was it
so yeah i feel like that was slightly lacking but then you know fill in the blanks on your own level of creativity upped
well i think that was i think that was an issue i kept finding with regard to well no but also yeah when i was reporting about what each of us was doing i was often confused as to what you were doing um and then i also felt like you know a lot of our discussion would centre around n specifically what my task was because that was kind of the interface portion which was what the whole project was about uh but and then in the end i think our jobs kind of melded together a little bit more
whatever
of what to do
mm
mm-hmm
uh-huh that wasn't very much
you know
mm
yeah
yes
mm mm
hmm very much so
yeah
that was fun
which was fine
i think the most helpful thing out of everything was getting the the powerpoint slides already put together for you 'cause if we didn't have that there's no way we could have got all that done in time
mm-hmm
yeah already having the formatted stuff helped a lot
very much so
cool
and i think your leadership was quite good
it was really good yeah
hmm
she said i i i she actually made a comment off boy you're getting into this and i really i think it's true i did get i i felt like i got way too into it
yeah
that's kind of a good thing though you know give the rest of us some structure to work with so hey
i felt like i slipped into it a lot
it's kinda fun
i dunno
an so is that the first time you've taken on that kind of role
the first time i've ever done anything like yeah project project management
i usually organise crap it's one thing to do you know set up a party with your friends you know
hmm
yeah
yeah
little different
but you guys felt that you could keep the yeah suspension of disbelief kind of like like the role and the okay
yeah
yeah
i except for a couple moments where it just got out of hand and i knew we were all lying through our teeth other than that
yeah
i had to admit as soon as w we started i mean as soon as we got the play doh
i could only imagine
th you know the whole concept of really trying to stick with reality went out the window
yeah yeah
maybe in in legos you know
possibly
be fun with legos too like make a remote control or spaceship
we used to have spaceship legos did you guys ever used to build spaceships with legos everybody knows best spaceships ever
oh yeah still have 'em
yeah
totally
um you guys felt like there was enough teamwork in all
yeah
i think so
yep
hmm
you don't
no i no i dunno i d i i dunno i don't i i was just i
though we didn't actually i mean other than minor discussion at meetings there wasn't except for the actual building
yeah
but i feel like if this was a team project there actually would have been much more of the collaborative like brainstorming
it's true huh
use the board well and this would have been six months' worth of work not like three hours' worth of meetings
yeah
i mean i think had the issue been more serious we probably woulda brainstormed more during our meetings as a team
yeah
that's true
yeah
course i'm i'm conscious of the idea of the project manager asking if you guys feel like there's a team you know it's like
kind of like like hmm
it d
yeah that is kind of
but yeah
interesting
it's kind of fascinating wasn't it
i mean the whole process of
wonder why is there anything about the way that we got so much inform what was it that kept us from going to the the board
i don't know
i i don't know if there was a ri i th
mine was the mics
i didn't feel like getting up and down and dealing with all these wires i was afraid i was gonna break something actually
yeah that's it 'cause the mics are loose and each time you get up it's s a possibility of tripping over something or getting tangled or
yeah
mm
yeah
yeah
well i dunno what i woulda shown on that board
true but it didn't even occur to me as an option i mean i don't know that i would have but i know that i consciously didn't
nor i
i mean it's just like the paper i don't know what i really needed the paper for
true
um because i've got this laptop
yeah
standard i just used it 'cause it's literally right in front of me
yeah
i wanna see the output files from these um from the digital paper
well it looks really professional
i wanna see wh wh what my my handwriting looks like digitized because my handwriting is crap
i know
yeah that's it
i mean just to see what it looks like in p. d. f. format or something
usually i would do a lot more doodling too but i didn't because
i know i felt like i needed to be professional so i didn't like draw all over my paper and stuff
okay well not entirely but still i doodled less than i usually do
t i i'm curious about what the de briefing is gonna be like
you know like what is the uh
what exactly we're looking for here
so is this all we need to get through
i dunno i'm not sure what the new ideas found i is about
i guess
um
new ideas
it did it just say in an email that we need to discuss that
is it
well that's the thing i got i in the email i got this powerpoint file but this slide was just there mm-hmm
that slide was like that
i didn't change this one at all
hmm
well
um ch
i guess we're on the right track
yeah well
any new ideas with regard to remote control concepts
w i kinda like th
no none
uh i think they still do their job
i think they're fine actually
yeah you can't
i am thinking outside the little square box though with literally in like form i don't
yeah
yeah maybe a s a circle would be alright different
yeah
does kinda make you wonder i mean how much can you do with a remote control
it's like inventing a new car
yeah yeah you can
it's still gotta be technically car shaped or it won't fit on the road you know
yeah
don't know
hmm
um
what is that
'kay
our limited ability to think outside the box
kind of
so this was other costs
are we back into project mood
i dunno
i think this is
oh how long was our meeting supposed to be
how much time do we have left
forty ish i i i mm we should go on a bit yeah about the project eval um
i dunno about you guys but i felt like
a bit
under stimulated on the whole thing
like what like you know what am i really doing you know what is
mm
yeah
at the beginning it started out and i felt actually like under pressure like the first couple were taking a lot of work and i was like had like all this brainstorming i was doing and then suddenly i was like well it's just another two minute presentation that you guys don't really care about anyway so type away
yep
yeah
why
hey
huh i think it was the real
you know you know what i mean like we all sort of knew where we were headed with it so it didn't feel like it mattered anymore
yeah
yeah
definitely when when i first filled out the questionnaire i was marking it probably higher in terms of how much i had to how much i stressed over it and then by the time i got to the last one i was like
mm-hmm
you know not very much
whatever
mm
yeah
think it was also realisation of you basically just copy and paste what's given to you into your presentation which uh wasn't so clear to me at the beginning
yeah
very much yeah
i actually didn't do that at all though every single one i a all the presentations i either added slides or edited 'em
mm-hmm
i di
oh i added like five slides too but i
see i only got blank ones
oh
did you really
i just got blank ones and
what
really
my slides were all blank they'd have a title maybe and they were just empty
yeah mine too
me too
did they not have they didn't like uh mine yeah they didn't come like this
like with this was what it looks like
like with those words already on it
this is what that looked like literally just like that
no
no
interesting
i wondered why yours always looked so more complicated
uh-huh huh-huh
i deleted slides
i think i added a slide one time
i added many slides every time yeah
hey with the whole new background being innovative yeah that was class
that was pretty cool it was a high moment of the whole experiment
um
mm
interesting
any other thoughts come to mind
i wanna know how our product would fare
i can't just leave it there
i think it would fail i think
it'd be a huge disaster especially if it looks like that
i think it would take extensive marketing okay an apple with a red button on top even i am sceptical
but you know the whole
even you
yeah
i don't we kind of designed it to look little bit like a face
yeah but
i know it is
it's a happy face
actually that looked a lot more like a tongue from previous to uh fr some other design uh modifications
mm
builds
mm
i hope you appreciate the uh incorporation of some tin foil from a uh random kit kat bar that happened to be consumed
i i noticed that
by accident
interesting
well huh
an interesting day all in all i would say
yeah it's uh
uh yeah i'd say so
so again i reiterate my question of how different we are comp compared to the other groups especially between culture groups and what not
i know
mm i know
mm
it seemed like everything flowed pretty logically
i wanna see a
i
you know from the the the basics to the conce although the whole concepts thing the whole concepts phase i don't think i really understood like the concept
yeah
well the id okay the notion of yeah i mean i it's not like i have a concept of a mug's material it's just it is what it is
'cause it's such a functional item
yeah
you know
maybe i rather than concepts i it should be th thought of we sh i i thought of i thought of rather than in terms of concepts i thought of it in terms of um like
proposed idea
and then the final would be like th the actual specified prototype or whatever i dunno
mm
but
hmm
all in all it's kinda interesting
mm
so we have more slides or
no just this closing one
no we've established that the costs weren't really within budget but we could s you know do it
we got it to be
we did the project evaluation based on um sarah's evaluation of on off switches and
like cutting corners
kind of though it was really technically an evaluation of the product not the project in general
mm
mm
which i'm not sure is the same thing at the time that just i made more sense but i could see if they were really asking about us
true
yeah
'cause we di we had a thu think about it
um
yeah
and it's all recorded woo hoo
yeah what i'm gonna i'm gonna put um i'm supposed to do this final report thing at the end so i'll put all that into the final report as well
yay
hmm
or as much as seems like maybe not like the articles and stuff
like because and if and so forth but i'll put most of it in the reports
i
make it sound eloquent
it'd be so cool if we get a copy of the recording
oh
i have to done i've i've done transcription before and it's really ridiculous how many words people say like just in the middle of their sentences like that that mean nothing
nice
oh yeah
there's a whole branch of psychology that looks into that psycholinguistics
what the uhs and the
really
there's a guy studying it here yeah he's studying ums and ahs or something
filler words or
yep they're called um disfluencies
yeah
disfluencies
that's a good word for it
yeah we like our fancy phrases and terminologies for things
just add some prefixes sounds classier
exactly uh i will save this into the
project documents
i find myself hitting the send and receive button on the email a lot just out of boredom like c come on gimme something
i yeah pretty compulsively during meetings like yeah
mm
yeah
oh yeah
yeah i know
come on give me some information
well to be fair we're we're hooked we're all hooked on the internet so i mean i do the
yeah we are addicts
that's scary yeah
it is scary
mm
well just around that eight or or nine people that are
i know imagine we went the first ten y fifteen years of our lives without the internet
it's only in the last ten that we're like where's the internet
yeah
i mean you know it just in the past five we've gone from twenty eight eight modems to broadband all the time
i yeah
dude i think we've had internet for like eighteen years
true
no we have but i not in the sense that it's so un you know uh ubiquitous
i yeah
yeah
but it's not regular i mean my grandparents had it in the eighties and i got it in ninety four but still
it's crazy
uh-huh
so
in the eighties
my um grammy does computer science back in the states and so they had um an e. d. u. and gov network
mm
there's basically the fundamental structures but it wasn't uh household to household yet because it hadn't been
right
yeah it was to the like seven universities or something
partitioned off and stuff yeah that was him
you guys ready to celebrate
yeah that's our last step
apparently does that include like champagne or something exciting
celebration
should
i think so
'kay i guess we can probably call that meeting to an end for the most part
i think that's a closer
cool
has it been forty minutes or whatever
this has been long enough
celebrate
where do you find that
i have no idea
is that the only song you have
there is another one
is this one of those media player
huh
yep
w oh
that's awesome
the default track
maybe i have a different one
i thought it was david burns look into the eyeball
that's one that seems to be shipping with it uh shipped with for a while maybe this is the new version
so is that a close
yeah i guess we'll call that a a doner
okay that's the end of the meeting
fab
thank you gentlemen
i feel like i'm signing off
okay
hi everybody and welcome to our kick off meeting um for our new product that we're gonna be designing
um i'm mandy and i'm the project manager
and i know all your names again courtney fenella and amber
yep
yep
alright
okay so first let's go through this powerpoint
i wonder what button i press
just do it on the arrow
yeah or how about i just click
okay here is our agenda for this meeting
um we're gonna start with our opening which was our introductions
we're gonna get to know each other a little bit better
um tool training we're going to i guess figure out what to do on this project with our individual roles
um we're gonna make a project plan and then have some time for discussion and close up the meeting
okay here is our project
we're gonna make a new remote control that's um original trendy and also user friendly
and how we are going to do it is each of us is going to um we're gonna have discuss the functional design first
how is it gonna be used what's the actual goal here it has to operate t. v. blah blah blah
and we're going to do individual work on that and then meet
same thing with conceptual design
just the basic overview of the project and then we're going to do individual work meet
that's pretty much the the whole process for today
and then the detailed design just more in depth get the actual schematics of the remote
okay
alright
first we're gonna start off by using our tools
and the whiteboard thing do you guys wanna give that a try even though the ink wasn't working or do you wanna do it on here
i think we should forgo the whiteboard since we can't actually see what we're writing
we could
yeah we could on here
alright let's go forward then
um right now so we're all gonna draw our favourite animal and then sum up our favourite characteristics of that animal
even if you are not a good drawer like me
alright
artistic skills nil
fine
um
oh thanks
bless you
i draw like i'm in grade five
oh do i
'kay about one more minute
okay
okay
and who would like to start us off
i'll go
alright
um this is my picture
i drew fish i like fish because uh you know their whole water vascular system thing
it's pretty cool and um they've got a pretty good habitat and they are pretty sometimes sometimes vicious but that's okay
only if they're piranhas
yeah
yeah they they're easy you know
yeah
alright
who wants to go next
i'll go
i drew a kitty
it's pretty much impossible to tell that's a cat but i love cats
no i i see it
no i kne i knew
no it looks like a cat
yeah it does look like a cat
i love cats because they're independent uh they pretty much know what they want they get it they move on
i love cats too
yeah
i'm a cat person
i'm allergic to cats
ah
uh
i'm allergic to cats too
oh okay
if you're around one i had a roommate who was um allergic
in my next life
but if she was around my cat forever she became used to it you know it's weird
yeah yeah if you're around them for a long period of time
i still can't sleep with them in my room
okay
oh yeah this summer i oh i had to live with cats
it was crazy
yeah
okay fenella
um i drew a badger
cool
yay
badger
well yeah
good choice
why a badger
uh
i dunno they're grumpy and nocturnal and
are you trying to suggest something
well a little bit like the yes
um
and then if you know wind in the willows badger
oh okay
yeah and then uh i don't know if you know brian
he's liverpudlian writer
alright
um that kind of books
badgers are cool in that one too
okay
and i'm last
'kay
look at my sad sad giraffe
no that's good
no no no it ends up looking like some kind of a dinosaur but whatever
i don't know even much about giraffes but i just love the way they look
they're just such odd creatures you know
i i like that they're so unique and individual i guess
i don't know much about their behaviour or anything though
only seen a couple in zoos
you don't really have to i mean if you like 'em
yeah but you can appreciate the way they look
okay
alright
guess we're getting straight back into business here
um the selling price for our remote is going to be twenty five euro and our profit aim is fifty million euro
we're going to make this an international product marketed in the states in europe in asia
and um our production cost to make that profit is gonna be a max of twelve fifty euro per remote
okay
so we're gonna talk for a little while
um here are some topics that we might be able to discuss
expe our experiences with remote controls um our first ideas about this new remote anything that you can bring to the table for this project
so
now
yeah
you wanna start us off
anybody have anything to offer
well we wanna make a multifunctional remote right
right
one remote for everything
and everything being wait we have what sound system t. v. d. v. d. v. h. s. uh tivo
right
um
i think they'll be phasing v. h. s. out shortly
yeah tivo
tivo
but it's still there so
okay
if po if we're gonna do it
it needs to be compatible 'cause universal remote controls are never universal
they're never universal
that's right
esp e especially if you buy a a not big product d. v. d. player say usually it doesn't work if it's not one of the yeah
or if it's not like a sony if it's like a i don't know
yeah
something from sam's club
so we'll have to figure it how to cover all the different variances in signals
yeah
and what we need an insanely good instruction booklet because you always have to reconfigure all your contraptions to go with the remote anyways
yeah
'kay and um another thing that i think is important is the d the design of the product how it feels in your hand
if it's just flat and kind of boring th those don't nobody wants to buy those any more
they want the ergonomic ones
they want like the flashy lights
yeah
oh like this came from las vegas
ones that ones that look high tech too
but at the same time are simple
mm yeah
right
so that people like my mother can use it
what about something with the curvature like that matches the curvature of a hand
yeah
'kay
anybody have any experiences with remote controls that they can remember that
just bad ones
yeah
that's true
um
what kinda battery would we want to use
because battery changing is usually okay
d
double a.
double a.
do some of them use triple a. s though
yeah some use triple a. s
some but
so double or triple
okay
yeah i guess then it's
if we need to do triple a. we can but most people usually have double a. s around
okay
yeah
but that has to do with the size of it too
right
yeah
well w as long as we know that issue is
yeah if we want it to be more thin then we'd probably wanna go with a triple a.
here we can
triple a
can you with a small lithium battery
but it's okay we don't have to decide about it now just as long as we remember battery type and size is important
hey
anything else
alright
moving along
oh we're closing the meeting
next meeting is gonna start in thirty minutes
here's what we're going to do
um the i. d. which is who
okay you're going to think about the working design
what do you think that means
okay
and u. i. d. the technical fun functions design
mm-hmm
making sure it does everything that we need the remote to do the functionality of it operating all those different things
okay
and the marketing person that's courtney is going to do the user requirements specification
i guess that means specifying um what exactly the user is going to be looking for
right
right
i would think so
okay
and you're gonna get more specific instructions emailed to you in just a little while
okay so does anybody have anything they wanna say before we close the meeting
okay
this meeting is officially over
okay
um welcome to our second meeting
this is the functional design meeting
and i hope you all had a good individual working time
okay let's get started
okay here's the agenda for the meeting
after the opening um i am going to
fulfil the role of secretary take the meeting minutes
and we're gonna have three presentations one from each of you
then we're gonna discuss some new project requirements
um gonna come to a decision on the functions of the remote control
and then we're gonna close up the meeting
and we're gonna do this all in about forty minutes
okay
first i want to discuss the goals of this meeting
first we need to determine the user requirements and the question that we can ask ourselves is what needs and desires are to be fulfilled by this remote control
and then we're going to determine the technical functions what is the effect of the apparatus
what actually is it supposed to do what do people pick up the remote and use it for
and then lastly we're going to determine its working design how exactly will it perform its functions that's the whole technical side of
'kay i'll just give you a minute 'cause it looks like you're making some notes
'kay
oh well let's go ahead and back previous
so what i wanna do right now is hear from all three of you on your research that you just did
who would like to start us off
i don't mind going first
'kay
okay
um do you have a powerpoint or no
yeah it's in the should be in the m project
okay
do you want us to do our powerpoints now or
you know you could you could do it yourself actually
oh
did you send it
save it in the project documents
put it in project documents yeah
okay
mm mm mm
this one
sure
okay
yeah
okay
okay
great
um well the function of a remote control as what uh we've been informed
is basically to send messages to the television set for example
switch it on switch it off go to this channel go to channel nine turn the volume up etcetera
um some of the considerations is just um for example the what it needs to include it's the numbers
you know zero to nine so you can move to a channel the power button on slash off
the channel going up and down
volume going up and down and then mute
a mute function
and then functions for v. h. s. d. v. d. for example play rewind fast forward stop pause enter
and enter would be for like you know the menus
and then other menus for d. v. as well as t. v.
whether that means like um we can go and decide the brightness of the screen things like that all the more complicated functions of menus
and we can decide if that's what we want um if we want to include that on the remote
okay
if that's something that would stay on the t. v. itself for example
okay
these are two examples
um and you can see on the left it's got a lot more buttons
and i don't know if you can read it but it says step go to freeze
um slow repeat program mute and so those are some of the buttons and so it gives you an idea of s one example
and then on the right it's a lot more simpler it's got volume it's got the play the like circle set which is play
rewind but it's also what is fast forward is also like next on a menu
so you have functions that are d uh duplicating
right
and you have a mute button and then the numbers and the eject and the power button
so that gives you two different kinds a more complex and more simple version
okay
ready
and then lastly it's just the questions that we want to consider like what functions do we want it to include
and how simple complex it should be
and what functions it needs to complete
uh what are needed to complete insulation process 'cause you know
that's something that also has to be considered and it's gonna be hopefully a one time thing
when you set it up it should be set to go
but we have to include the functions that can allow it to set up i in the first place
so that's it
alright
very good presentation
thank you
you speak with such authority on the matter
mm
okay
left
who would like to um follow that one up
now that we've discussed okay
i can go
do you want me to run it or you wanna okay
yeah you should run it
functional requirements
mm yes
'kay
alright
now we have courtney with the functional requirements
yes okay so we tested a hundred subjects in our lab and we just we watched them and we also made them fill out a questionnaire
and we found that the users are not typically happy with current remote controls
seventy five percent think they're ugly
eighty percent want they've are willing to spend more which is good news for us um if we make it look fancier
and basically w we just need something that really i mean there's some other points up there but they it needs to be snazzy and it but yet simple
so that's really what we need to do
wait
and we need we need it to be simple yet it needs to be high tech looking
so
and that meaning what
like
they like i guess use the buttons a lot
okay
yeah
i don't know
it's from my uh research
right
okay what do you m oh i'm sorry
my team wasn't very clear
only use ten percent of the buttons
that's okay
what do you mean by um the current remote controls do not match well with the operating behaviour of the user like they have to press the buttons
i i think it's like the engineering versus user
okay
whereas like the engineering she showed that the engineering ones are more complex and users don't really need all of the buttons that are contained on there
oh right
the buttons
okay
because they only use ten percent of the buttons really
yeah
okay
we only use ten per cent of our brains
good point
it works
it's a necessary evil
yeah
ready for the next slide
mm-hmm
and so people say that they typically lose it as you yourself know because you probably lose your remote control all the time
hmm
much like any small appliance like a cellphone and they we need something simple because most people
lost
well thirty four percent say that it's just too much time to learn how to use a new one
and we don't want to go we don't want to vary too far from the normal standard remote
s
but i mean they do need to be able to identify it and r. s. i. i'm not very sure what that is
it's okay
it's very important
yes it is important for the remote control world
wait is that like your
ergonomics like your hand movements or something
sh
could be yeah
uh possibly
do we really need t to provide more information on what r. s. i. is
like
oh
uh yeah that's what my web site said i
channel volume power
don't know
i think that's a pretty good guess though
yeah i would assume so
i think we're supposed to know it as remote control experts
it's like if you're holding it
yeah
but also s so the channel
it's okay
the volume and the power buttons are the most important on our company website you can find like the specific statistics concerning to how much each button is used
but those are the definitely the top ones
okay
next slide
yes
and so personally i think that we need a modern eye catching design but it it really needs to be simple
so saying from y your slide your presentation the engineering versus the user specified remotes i think that we should go with something that's more user friendly
user friendly
where the engineering ones the boxes tend to make it look more complicated than it really is
um the functionality of the product really needs to be considered as to like what type of buttons do we really need on it
and it needs to be open to a wide range of consumers so even though we need a small number of buttons
we also need to take in like are most people going to be using it for a d. v. d. player
a tivo what what exactly are we using it for as well as the age range
so we need a hip but not a corny marketing scheme for promoting our product
and also we found our team found that speech recognition is it's like an up and coming thing they really consumers are really interested in it
and since our findings found that people are willing to pay more money for a remote for it to be more high class we could consider it
and so just to just to clarify by speech recognition you mean they would say channel five and the thing would go to channel five
i guess so yeah
okay
to just say where are you and thing beeps you know
oh that'd be lovely
yeah i guess we can interpret it like we can just try out different types of speech recognition within our remote programme
yeah
didn't they um didn't our rival companies manufacture a remote that you would press the button on the t. v. and it would the remote would beep so if you have lost it
it's kinda like what the remote phone used to do
mm
oh yeah that's true
you know like go to the base
we could definitely include that if we wanted to
yeah
if it's within our price
okay
are we ready for our last presentation amber
yeah i'm just trying to move it
okay
'kay
i think it should be there working design
working design
there we go
'kay
'kay
uh i didn't get a chance to complete this one 'cause some of the tools that i was given were frustrating
oh my bad
oh that's fine
uh okay so method method of our design i think i just start listing th some of the things that we actually need to put into this
help me
we need a power source we're gonna need a smart chip if we're gonna make it multi functional
um extra functions will probably need an additional chip
either that or the smart chip will have to be extremely smart
what exactly is a smart chip
usually a smart chip is just a chip that's been programmed and designed so that it can complete a fair range of functions
well how much extra would the additional chip be
is that gonna push us over our production costs
i wouldn't think so 'cause we could probably get it from like in bulk from a a newer company
mm-hmm
and they tend to sell their chips pretty cheap
okay
ready
um yep nothing here
that's okay
um power source i figured batteries 'cause they're easily available
typically a remote has either two double a. s or four triple a. s sometimes three
uh it really kinda depends on the size of the actual remote itself
um a large on off button demographically we're moving towards an older generation of people so a large on off button would probably be good
hmm
selection button for various entertainment devices so you want something that will permit you to select the d. v. d. player or the t. v. or the stereo system
um smart chip that perverts uh that permits sorry universal application again
something that'll allow us to skip over between devices and that's kinda it
uh this is my fifty second design
power source over here
we're gonna have a switch obviously between the power source and the rest of it and you're gonna need the switch
um extra bulb could just be for flashiness um subcomponent which would be like a way of diverting the power to different parts of the the device
um the chip and of course the infra red bulb so it can communicate with the various devices that it needs to talk to
so what exactly we are looking at is this like the front of the remote
this is just like a rough schematic
so this is the internal workings
so this would be the front
so the red would be the front of the remote though right
oh okay
yeah
yeah that's gonna be what's communicating with the t. v. but the other bulb i think
okay
is good to just to indicate i'm doing something it's sort of like a reassurance
the l the light up kind of yeah
like that we know the battery's working
yeah so you don't have to stare at that infra red 'cause you know when the battery starts dying in your remote currently
you have to actually stare at that bulb and go okay when i push this button is it working
hmm
okay
it'd probably be lighting up the key too right
we can skip that whole thing
yep
yeah
yeah
'kay
so you can put it in the dark
the buttons
yeah and that's good
we should make it glow in the dark
okay
yeah definitely
'kay nex r ready
yeah that's it
'kay any p 'kay
mm 'kay
anything you wanna add for personal preferences though you f you said already that we needed a large on off button you think
i think that that's a good idea because you know that's one of the most important buttons
anything else
just
okay
well should it be larger buttons in general you know like uh the examples that i had they were swi quite small
so should we try and go for something that has l larger buttons
i think we should
like i think that would be in a as in like in for the design sorry um
i think we should definitely go with buttons that don't look like a normal remote 'cause most remotes have small square buttons
mm
i think we should do something like maybe bigger and round like bubbles
ovals
yeah yeah
okay
okay let's talk about all of our
we'll come to decision later about all the components that we need to include let's um wrap up this one and i'm gonna go back to my powerpoint
'cause we need to discuss the new project requirements which you might've already seen flashed up on the screen a bit earlier
wait come back
alright
sorry let's go through this
alright
here we go
new product requirements
first it's only going to be a t. v. remote
we're trying not to over complicate things
so no d. v. d. no tivo no stereo
okay
it's not gonna be multi functional
hey
and we th need to promote our company more so we need to somehow include our colour and our company slogan on the remote
we're trying to get our name out there in the world
okay
and you know what teletext is
yeah
in states we don't have it but um it's like they just have this channel where just has news and weather kind of sports
i know
what is it
it's very um bland looking it's just text on the screen not even yeah just black with just text
yeah it's like black black and white kind of
like running along the bottom
yeah
you can also get the kind of the t. v. guide so
it'll give you the sports
wait is it like the weather channel where it's got like the ticker running on the bottom or something
kind of
except the entire screen
it's the entire screen is just running information at random
yeah it's the whole screen
you can pick sports you can pick the news you entertainment you know it's like
so anyway
seemingly
so it's like a separate channel from like what you're watching
right
right
yeah
but it's becoming out dated now because of the internet
nobody needs to go to the teletext channel to check the news
and we have twenty four hour news channels now too so those are our new product requirements
okay
okay
so do we have to include the company colour within that
alright
mm-hmm
yes
it's part of the logo
okay
company colour being yellow
what we're going to do right now is come to some decisions definitive that we can all agree on
about um the target group and the functions and just definite things that we need to do and then we'll close up the meeting
so
alright
whatever
okay
so our target group is you mentioned um older people
mm-hmm
would it just be universal for everyone you think
because i think even if something has large buttons as long as they are not childishly large like even technically
it's gonna make it nicer
yeah
non technically challenged people are gonna use it
i mean they want something user friendly so
mm well even if we kept the regular standard size of remote
if we reduced the buttons down to the ones that people are saying that they use the most often and a couple extra
'cause they're saying they only use ten per cent of them then we should be able to accommodate fairly decent sized buttons
yeah
yeah
okay so we want um for our target group would we say
i mean young and old all age ranges all um not kids obviously right
or kids
no kids need to know how to use a remote i would think
most of them will intuitively pick it up though
they gotta change between disney channel cartoon network
okay so we're going to go anywhere from kids to adult in the age range um what about
yeah i think we need it all
technic technical um specifications like how how technically literate are these people who are going to be using our remote
um i would say we should say dumber than the average person
we should go for the lowest denominator
okay
yeah
right okay
high school educated
so so they need no technical experience to operate
how 'bout little to no because there is no way that you are gonna be able to make it no
okay
and we also need to determine the specific functions of this just to get it all out on paper
so we said it needs to send messages to the t. v. needs to change the channel turn on and off just basic simple stuff like this
so if you have something just say it and we'll add it to my meeting minutes
well it's channel on off button volume mute
mm-hmm volume
and channel
yeah
those are the most important ones
right
and we wanna keep um i'll make a note here that we wanna keep the number of buttons down
correct because people only use ten percent
yeah
'kay
hey what else
um
um
do we want this thing to be able to be found easily
i think so
what do you
sure yeah
a finding kind of device or yeah ho homing device
and
i need we we need a like homing device
like if this is gonna get lost underneath the coach how are we going to accommodate the quick ability to find it
oh right yeah okay
mm 'kay
tracking
because people really are looking for a remote that's more high tech
okay
right
what if we gave it a charger
and on the charger just like a phone like you get a portable phone and it's got a charger and if you d leave your phone somewhere
but you got a base
you push the button to find it and it finds th the phone beeps for you
do you think people'll really go for that though
because
it's useful for the remote phone
hmm
yeah
would that add to our costs at all i wonder
i would think so because you'd have to develop a base
right
well if you have the base you could start putting in a charger and then you have a different kind of battery
yeah
hmm
rechargeable batteries are cheaper usually
yeah
okay
i i think we can make a decision about that later
uh we'll still put that as a point that we need to discuss
so that would include battery source
power source rather
is it going to have a charger or is it going to be run strictly off batteries
and we also need to deal with the issue you mentioned of speech recognition if we want that
right
do w
well then we could if we have the speech recognition then we can start aiming at a like another kind of more handicapped disabled uh demo demographic
mm
well th there's the people who desire speech recognition there's the different demog demographics have different desires i don't know if you guys ge
you could um we could hook it up
it wouldn't copy onto the the thing 'cause it's black but all the different age groups have different desires for speech recognition
oh
so basically older people don't really care
it's really the people twenty five to thirty five
i feel those are the people that really watch a lot of t. v. though
mm-hmm
they're the ones that get addicted to soap operas and
well
and if and if we introduced it when they're this age they're going to probably always buy a remote that has
just sitcoms and stuff
right
so
well then then do you put the voice recognition do you put the r like receiver on the actual television
in the base or in the actual remote
'cause then you've already got remote in your hand why you just gonna speak to the remote
right
whereas if you just speak in general and you don't have to have the remote in your hand and like talk at it
yeah
and the speech recognition could be part of the lost and found device too
if we said find remote locate remote or something
right
a certain phrase
then it could beep
i dunno
just throwing it out there
yeah
well
still fifteen minutes
um
okay anything else we wanna discuss
well do we wanna include the numbers like zero through nine
can we conceive of leaving them out
um
wait on the remote itself
yeah like you have one two three four five six seven eight nine zero
well we definitely need those
how how yeah how would you leave those out
yeah
well i don't know i mean if you can like well i don't know if there's just a way of leaving them out
unless you could say the channel
i think people would find that too foreign
yeah
yeah that's true
you definitely need
and also remember that in this day in age we need you know like a hundred button too
i used to have a remote that did not even go up past like fifty
so i couldn't whenever i got cable i had to get a new t. v.
it's when we get satellite
mm
get your own remote or digital cable
yeah
'kay
um
i guess we're gonna discuss the project financing later making sure that we can fit all of the stuff that we want to on our budget
um
yeah 'cause i don't have any material pricing information available to me at the moment so
'kay
and don't forget we need to include the colour
of our company and the logo
the colour being yellow
wait
i'm guessing
and how do we
i feel like a ye i feel like a yellow one would be too garish
and the r. r.
r. the double r.
we could just have the logo in yellow or maybe a yellow light for the keys
can't make it entirely
or is the l
or put like stripes oh yeah yellow lights
yeah yellow could be and it could doesn't have to be huge
yeah
well if you have like a hang on
if you have this sort of strip kind of down at the bottom the base of it just like yellow with the r. r.
right
so we've simplified we don't need all those um play fast forward rewind
right yeah
yeah
or no menu buttons
so we've pretty much pared it down to on off volume mute channel up and down um the numbers
yeah
yeah
um can we go back to i'm gonna look really quickly back at those
two examples
examples and see if there is anything
yeah
which one is yours technical functions or functional requirement
oh it's a yeah
okay
yeah audi audio settings and screen settings we need those like audio settings mono stereo
pitch screen settings like brightness colour or do we just want that accessed accessed from the television itself
the t. v.
i think that that's fine just for the t. v.
i mean how often does the average user need to do that kind of stuff
well the other option is sort of like down at the bottom like farther away
you just have this sort of box inset where it's like the buttons that you don't use as much but occasionally you will use
hmm
yeah 'cause we need to we definitely need to have buttons for like sub titles and things like that
and so it's like
it's 'cause the foreign film market is expanding and stuff
and like on television like i know f k living in los angeles it's tons of spanish network television if it has english sub titles it's definitely helpful
couldn't we do that all through one button something a menu button that pops up with a menu on the t. v. that says
i don't well i don't know
you know audio video whatever language you know
right
so we need up down and side to side buttons
well that could be no you could just double up with like the channel or the volume buttons
for the menus
mm-hmm
that's true
yeah okay
channel is just up and down
okay yeah
and then add a
something that looks mayb you know
such as yeah the one the one over there on the left the engineering centred one
y right right right right
yeah
that one
so we just have it like add a menu button then for the various things needed
right
including v voice recognition if we have any like settings for voice recognition now
in the middle perhaps
included in the menu
yep
ooh i just got an idea for a design
good
anybody have anything else they'd like to bring up in this meeting
i had something but i forgot
okay
get out of here
let's go back to the meeting closure then and see what we need to do next
mm
alright
after this meeting we're gonna be sent a questionnaire and summary again which we need to reply to that e mail
and then we're gonna have lunch break
and after lunch thirty minutes of individual work time
um i'm gonna put the minutes i put the minutes for the first meeting already in the project documents folder if you'd like to review them
and i'm gonna type up the minutes for this one as well
um here's what we're each going to do
the i. d. is going to work on the components concept um u. i. d. the user interface concept and you're going to do some trend watching
'kay
specific instructions will be sent to you by your personal coach
and if anybody has anything they would like to add
no
okay well this meeting is officially over
thank you all
okay
hi team
hope you had a good lunch
okay we're back for the conceptual design meeting
um let's get started
'kay here is the agenda for today's meeting
um we're gonna open it and i'm gonna keep the minutes as project manager
we're gonna have three presentations one from each of you again
and then we are going to come to decision on the remote control concepts and then we're gonna close it up
and we have forty minutes again
'kay and just to reiterate um after this meeting the team will reach a decision on the concepts of the remote control
okay
let's go ahead and start off with your presentations
who would like to go first
just trying to move mine right now
okay
um courtney would you mind starting us off
yeah
okay
trend watching
yeah
'kay
okay so trend watching
uh since we do put the fashion in electronics it is kind of important how our product looks
so i guess we can go ahead and go to the next
so what they want
right now customers want fancy versus functional
um basically about fifty eight percent of what they like of the product that they want describing like the in order of how much they want
fifty eight per cent of the decision of what it should look like fancy versus functional
and then it has to also be technologically innovative and yet easy to use
so the customer basically is confused
they don't know exactly what they want
they want us to tell them
they want everything but simply
yes
exactly
okay
so we can go to next
mm 'kay
okay
so in milan and paris recently the trends have been showing that clothing shoes and furniture are basically just covered with fruits and vegetable patterns
so i don't know if we want to go with that um and also the spongy feel is in in contrast to last year
i don't know really
i mean i guess the spongy could relate to the buttons if we want to rather than like a hard clicky button that you find on like some mobiles and stuff
mm
mm
you'd want like a softer touch
i mean do you guys know what i mean
yeah th
right
yes
yeah
um
but as for the fruits and vegetable patterns i don't know if we really want to go with that because it is just a trend
and our product we want to stay around for much longer than just a few months because yeah
right
i i can
right
people don't buy a new remote every so often
i mean that could just be a spring thing right now
i can address some of that issue i think with uh my presentation
okay
awesome
okay
um so design preferences um we need easy to read like large buttons clearly labelled so that i mean 'cause we talked about that being a problem
um and then also buttons illuminating upon touch you said that in your design with the bulb
um and that could also tie in with the colour scheme
uh we need the real reaction logo and colour scheme obviously
that's one of our key goals we wanna promote our product
and i was thinking about different types of designs and i came up with something
actually right here
so what we could do is something like an old fashioned telephone like this
where we put the buttons around like we'd put a big on off button or something else in the middle
i mean it could be the arrows or whatever for channel up and down and then put the numbers around in like an old fashioned dial shape
'cause then it'll appeal to older generation and like said retro's cool
so it's classically retro
hmm
so i mean that's just an idea if you guys like it
very good
i like it
okay ready for the next slide
and yep
and that's it
op mm 'kay
okay
great
great presentation
ready
okay hang on
'kay
see if it's there
which one is it
i don't know
hang on
interface concepts no
interface concepts new
either refresh it or it sh oh wait maybe i didn't put it there
y
hang on
'kay
mine will always read copy of something or other
sorry
i i copied mine before i sent it over
oh okay
sorry hang on
don't know
oh there we go
okay
okay um looking at the interface concept it's gonna be mostly examples of possibilities of where we can go with this
uh if you wanna start the next slide
sure
um uh can't really see but there's two possible ways on the r left
if you see on th on the sides of of the remote you have the sort of scroll down so you have that option right there
and then also there's the idea of the base
that's sort of like an idea there
and then on the right we have what's really big trend right now it's the ipod
it's becoming really and so you have this sort of very very simplistic menu section uh with the round buttons
and it's sort of like you have the both kind of trendy and hip but also very sleek and
um and very simple but technologically advanced
so if you wanted to do that th if we could find a way of sort of like using that idea in a remote control then sort of
look into it but anyway next
mm 'kay
um there's the idea of like being able to do it by feel as well as by um by sight
you'd you know you're in the dark you don't wanna be looking at the remote control
and the picture particularly is pointing out if you look at the top volume button it's a v.
and so yo you're kind of feeling a v. like volume up
what it really is is a v. and what it you think it is is down because the down arrow
mm
and so it's like a sort of a criticism you'd probably turn that o the other way up
um but then you have you could either do it by raised type which could be you know iffy um sort of old fashioned in a way
mm
either that or just have it by shape for example you have a specific triangular shape that you know you're looking at the up and down arrow
and then the round ones you sort of feel by you know that's the second one down that sort of thing
so it's sort of looking into how we wanted t to do it by feel
okay
okay
um this is sort of an example of going for a s certain demographic
um this is particularly geared towards children
that's cute
um it's very cute and we could probably change it to yellow bright yellow for like a the for the company logo
um and you have the shapes and it's very simplistic and friendly looking
um and then the other thing that it would be able to do is just to pro be ab you program certain
channels that only these children would watch so it's like they ch watch you know the c. beebies or something like that
uh keep them away from other channels
so that's like another ar um i mean these are three examples sort of looking at it
okay
you have the wider section for the main controls there
uh you could see how many buttons there are
and then on the left you have an example of the round buttons and a simpler design
on the bottom we probably wouldn't need that because it's more for like a d. v. d. function which we are not gonna be using
um
so again it's sort of like just give you ideas and then down at the bottom you have the logos and that's where you could put the r. r.
real reaction
'kay
and then finally these are like the sort of same examples but also some more just possibilities that we could go with
none of them i'm particularly keen on by the way
yeah
hmm
no
but it's sort of like just taking aspects out of that and saying
well out of this one we like you know the round section of um b or we'd like the the button size on this
mm
or i like you know the black finish or the silver finish or whatever
right
i have four of those remotes
good lord
okay
ready
that's it
oh yeah
okay
great job
okay my turn
okay
okay
whoo
what's the title
it'll be copy of component design
got it
yeah
th that looks like it
'kay
so basic remote operation runs as follows press button makes connection with the power source and the rest of the circuit
chip senses the connection chip produces a morse code infra red signal specific to that button
so you press the button it produces uh a signal that's encoded specifically for that button
transistors amplify that signal and it goes to the t. v. 's centre which interprets the signal response accordingly changes channel etcetera
so that being said next slide please
findings oh which were the required materials for the basic internal construction so all the really simplistic functions that we just discussed we need rubber for buttons
aluminium for battery y contacts integrated circuit which consists of a diode transistor
resonator resistors and a capacitator all those basic things that make a circuit function
um fibreglass and thin copper wire to create the actual circuit board itself
an l. e. d. which is a light emitting diode um contact discs for the buttons
plastic for the casing and a power source whatever power source we've actually determined we want
next slide please
thank you
uh personal preferences uh to save money for the components the remote should be mass produced and basic materials should be bought en masse
um if we find another company who can produce the required chips casing l. e. d.
any additional materials we decide we require at a less expensive rate than we ourselves are producing we should go for it
next slide please
um just talking to the um manufacturing division
they suggested power options solar cells hand dynamo and kinetic power so you shake it and it increases the power
um i'm not sure how the hand dynamo works they have yet to get back to me on that
so next slide please
hmm
interesting
suggested casing options
okay
we can offer options for casing such as straight curved double curved you know very specific to the customer
options for materials plastic rubber titanium wood
i don't think anyone's gonna go for a wood one because splinters
that would be amazing though yeah
no splinters would
yeah
um certain restrictions do apply here though
uh latex you can't do solar power with a latex one
so if they want some a soft squishy rubber they can't have the solar powered option
double curved you can't do titanium
what is that
um that would be two curvatures so it would actually if you the shape of your hand you curve here and you curve here
mm
so you could have two curves that match the shape of your hand to make it more comfortable to hold
mm
now if you wanted that you can't do titanium
and uh so you functions what for the buttons scrolling function could be very beneficial to us instead of actual buttons themselves
right
i think i have one more slide
'kay
no i didn't
no okay
um the manufacturing division also has said that um they have several types of chips and they've just developed a sample sensor or sample speaker chip
which we could utilise
um push button requires a simple chip and scroll requires more complicated chip
so depends on what we decide we wanna do
in addition to that if we're offering all those different options to the customer for producing their remote we're going to have to have multiples of each type
like a double curved in rubber um you know each option should have a certain select number produced with all those options
so we'll have to mix it up make sure we produce enough of everyone
but that could also drive up the price of the actual remote itself if they know that we only produced five thousand you know double curved wooden remotes
mm
right
okay
hmm
and that's all i got
okay
alright well thank you for those informative presentations
let's go back to um now we have to make some decisions
where were we
let me just add one more thing that i couldn't say before and that's just that there's the new technology that they've developed on the voice recognition
sure
um
oh this the thing we were talking about earlier
right except that it's sort of odd and i'm no not exactly sure why they are explaining it in the way they are
um there's a sample sensor and there's a sample speaker unit for so
you would say like good morning coffeemaker and it would respond good morning jill but
i'm not sure exactly how it's gonna work 'cause do you programme do we program the responses and the questions
so does that mean that the user then has to ask the specific question and can't change it in order for it to be recognised
mm
or can it be altered in a certain way or does the actually user program it to say a channel means this
right
yeah like using the menu to be like enter your name into the screen like on the menu options
right
so that way the remote reads it
right so it's got like a limited memory and programme it
so it's sort of iffy but that's kind of what you'd say
mm
i feel like voice recognition would be
i don't know w it would be too hard to really i mean we could do it but
hmm
programme
if it's within our price to get that kind of chip that would you know technology
technology
well we are making the chip
hmm
so i mean
but i guess we have to look at w what our production cost is for the chip itself anyway
and it is a growing trend the higher technological like
yeah
mm
the i mean just like the more advanced it is
yeah
the better it'll sell
i i thought offering some of those options for different materials that it could be made of different
you know i think we'd have to decide on the power options maybe
hmm
so that we could reduce cost
yeah 'cause we need to know how big it's gonna be and how heavy
yeah
okay that kind of brings us to this let's let's see if we can decide what kind of energy source we want to have first and foremost
okay
um
do we wanna go for batteries or a stand like the one that we saw illustrated earlier
oh the base yeah
the base the charging base with rechargeable batteries
i think the p
i always feel like first i wanna know what it looks like before 'cause if it's something really really small
hmm
then it's sort of harder to imagine a base for it that was p quite a s substantial size sort of standing up
yeah and we don't have multiple things that it has to control it just has to control the t. v.
w
it's not gonna be a huge universal remote
we need to decide well so we can figure how big it's gonna be like exactly what buttons we want and exactly
right
what size battery and
well the other thing is like even if it's got a few buttons so we want it to be bigger than this
it could be like this
yes
i'd well uh
'cause it still fits in your hand so you still wanted something that's comfortable and substantial but not necessarily full of buttons
this one is really comfortable like i like the sides whatever because
are you gonna lose it easier
but if we have the um the locator then we don't have to worry about that
that's true
so we can make it small if we have a l locating device
if we do a voice activated locator though we're gonna be looking at a more substantial chip
yeah
so
hmm
so i that's the other thing it's like
you know
are we gonna have certain chips that are gonna require bigger size period
two double a. s
for this size
but like you know if we get more complicated then it's gonna v be have to be bigger to just accommodate the chip size
right
honestly i think the customer would be kind of irritated by the fact that it has a base if we did do a nice small compact
right
i agree it's either gonna be bigger with a base or smaller with just
yeah
so we sh
smaller without yeah
a battery like this guy
yeah
mm yeah
alright so what direction do you want to go in
you wanna vote
i think if we had a a locating device with the small one i think that seems way more advanced
i'm kind of i'm kind of leaning in the direction of this kind of
yeah
i'm a away from
the base
bigger and the base
yeah
yeah
'kay so
that just seems so clunky and
yeah because i mean if even looking at cellphones right now those trends the smaller the hotter it is yeah
smaller and smaller yeah yeah yeah
okay
the only problem with that is if you forget to take it out of your pocket and it goes in wash
oh
you're kidding
you know it happens
hmm
yeah
i've had three watches go that way too
oh watches i've but i've never washed a cell phone
ouch
a phone whoa that would wow that would hurt
okay so what kind of material do we want to be made out of
pieces everywhere
well we have lots of options
i don't think wood is a viable option
yeah wood
no
well titanium s i was saying that titanium if we're being restricted then
oh what did you oh sorry go ahead
i would probably lean away from that
yeah 'cause if it's gonna cost us more to produce a chip titanium will be more expensive
right
however well we only wanna sell it for twenty five euro right
what would you recommend
yeah
yeah
'cause i was thinking if we wanted to get the high in market then you could produce a few in titanium make them a rarity so to speak
that'll yeah exactly
mm
the selling point yeah
we could do that because all our research shows that people are definitely willing to spend more if
are we restricted by this
yeah
well the original
i i think we should just focus on one design and one concept right now
twenty five euros
okay
remotes
if this was a successful remote we might then produce a higher end version of it i think
yeah
good plan
good plan
okay so we wanna go for plastic or what would you recommend for materials
honestly i'd recommend like um uh since we're going with batteries instead of solar power i'd recommend maybe a uh soft like latex
hmm
because we could produce you know how cellphones have those overlays that you can change the colour
we could do uh one that fits in with the trends of the year so because this year is all fruit god only knows why
oh
mm-hmm
mm
yeah who knows
um we could do f a cherry cover for this year and then i if next year is stripes or solids you know
okay
so you're talking about like when it leaves our salesroom then it's all gonna be cherry coloured or is it gonna be the kinda thing where people come back and swap it
o or we could like take off this
they could buy cases maybe
they could come back
and buy the extra case
okay
if they wanted
i think it's good to sell a basic thing and then sell
so we could do like a b a hard base plastic and then we could give two latex covers to start
options
yeah
the what the top face right
yeah
okay
okay
yeah because the soft latex definitely is squishy
that's in
well i mean squishier than like yeah just a hard plastic
right
right
okay and what kind of chip would we need for this guy
how complicated are we gonna go with the voice activated
yeah
i don't think we should do voice i think we should just do um the recognition for when it's lost you know
a tracker yeah
could we yeah
'cause that uh what it type of yeah for voice activation would it be like a certain term what we would say like
hmm
because people could just be talking and we don't want it going off all the time
right
so uh
well we could give it a specific code you know remote missing
ooh
uh see i'm uh i'm strangely attracted to it because i know that's it's definitely gonna be big
because it's i don't know it's just so high tech
well my little sister got for christmas she got one of those key finders that's like a key ring
and you have to whistle in a certain frequency for it to work
yeah see that would just irritate me
and then she would laugh and it would start going off in her purse and you couldn't turn it off
oh dear
oh then maybe voice
so it became highly irritating
okay
maybe voice activation won't be good
so i think having a key phrase is much better
okay
alright
but it's not gonna be voice activated in the fact that you would say channel up and it would work right
yeah n n no we just want it to be a finder
but then it
just a okay alright
no
hmm
okay
but do can your can the department make
that would be like a mid class um yeah
oh brilliant then
so we don't actually have to go for
well if they've just developed the sample sensor sample speaker it's a brand new chip
why not introduce it in this way
no
yeah good point
mm 'kay
uh and what size batteries double a. triple a.
i think triple a. it'll be lighter
two
could it run off of two
i mean more more come in a package
well that depends on what the energy is needed
yeah
i think well we could d r do two or we could do one small lithium
'cause you know the lithium batteries are doing quite well in most other electronic products right
so they're more widely available now
and they also have a longer battery life than most batteries
they're more expensive though too
but if you only have to replace it every five years
mm
that's a good point
thoughts anybody
as long as we sell it with it
well how about a initial you get one battery when you buy it 'cause i'm pretty sure we can get them pretty cheap on bulk
right that's what i meant
we could think about it and come back to it next meeting
okay
yeah
yeah
we still have one more meeting
alright
okay
so we've covered that first category user interface concept meaning design
what's it gonna yeah what's it gonna look like
okay
um
i ki i kind of like your idea about the retro phone dial and that the central button could have maybe our logo on it
it might be the four way scroll too
yeah it could be whatever as long as there's something big in the middle because like the old phones
i mean if yeah
yeah
there's like that just like piece of metal or like a picture or something in the middle
mm-hmm
well my issue with that is if it got too big though 'cause if you have the circle and the button in the middle
then is it gonna get wider than your your hands are because w and then would the buttons be too small if it was enough to fit on it
mm
oh that's true
good point
in the sample ones that you showed us there was one that had the scroll buttons on the side
yeah
yeah
which i think if we make it curved like a hand like a hand shape like if we put the the scroll button on the side that could be particularly useful
oh i see what you mean
i think so
so scroll buttons on the side and then buttons on top
yeah i like that
'kay
but we definitely if we have scroll things on the side we definitely have to have 'em labelled
mm
yeah like on the side of it
well if it's just up and down
oh if it's just up and down
but is that for which
volume or channel
i don't know
well you could do some on both sides
do we have both sides
can we
mm yeah
we should probably make it that you have to depress it to activate it then
yeah
so that you're just not holding it and it changes the chan
'cause oth otherwise you're not just holding it and going like this you know
that's squishy
that's squishy
well the other option is in instead of a scroll you just have the buttons up on the side which are on the side
have buttons
mm
okay
yeah
yeah that
hmm
'kay any other ideas
um what colour
oh yeah
latex covers
we have to make sure that logo always sticks out when we put the latex covers on
w
so we'll have to like have a little square or something so that the our logo's available
well i sort of like having the a yellow strip at the bottom with the r. r. like that
yeah
and that's at the bottom of it
i think maybe we should do it on a b button itself though
because if people are able to change the covers i don't know maybe the on off button
which button
something some the menu button i don't know but you know if we're gonna put our company logo on there and somebody could just get
another one
are they all gonna have our company logo on them
every cover
yeah i don't think we should do that because that would just be icky
yeah
so i think maybe putting it on a button is probably a good idea
if we want it to be visible and
um are all those those one that you showed where they were um s met silver metallic looking
yeah
but those are plastic right
yeah
they're not titanium
i kind of like that look
uh but or if it was really yeah for the base or if we're going for the retro look
for our base one
i think like a really shiny black would be cool
yeah or like a gun metal grey 'cause then it combines the silver and the black
what are your thoughts
gun metal gray
there you go gun metal gray
i'm just really wary of the putting anything on a button
why
it'll wear off
what's the button well w w then what's the button do and how do you know that that is what the button does
yeah buttons wear off
mm
i guess
just looking at examples y you just don't ever see the logo on a button it's always on the actual casing
right
hmm
there's nothing saying that we have to put the logo on the front of the actual
but we want it to be seen
on the back
but you don't but uh yeah you don't see it
it d visible visibility though 'cause if it was only on the back really the only time you're gonna see it is when you drop it or when you're changing the battery
we need it to be seen
well hang on
the other option is i don't know if you can see it but it's like if
i can find it again
yeah it's like the second to last slide
okay
and yours was called interface concept
interface yeah
this one
yeah
well for some reason i can't get it to just go to that slide directly
um
okay it's the very right one
you see at the bottom it's kind of difficult to see but you have like a d sort of s division between the bottom like
where the logo is and if we have the replaceable section it's like the top
it doesn't necessarily replace the entire top
mm
and so you have that one piece that stays and the rest just sort of clips in
okay yes yes
if c you envisioning it
and so that stays the same when you have the logo and then you have this s slip that kinda clips in and that's the bit that changes
okay
the only problem is we're using a latex overlay so it actually would go over top of everything and have holes for the buttons
hmm
so i was thinking maybe instead of doing that what we could do is leave a space for where the logo should be
yeah
yeah yeah
like a little cut out kind of
yeah
right
that's like you know a a cellphone it's like the the screen is always just left opened
okay
right
and so what we are gonna do it like bright yellow with the r. r.
yeah
some of tho
anybody see anything that they liked in these ones
well some of those buttons though are blue based
um well a lot of those buttons are blue based
mm
well kind of
mm
um and then if v we do have them illuminate upon contact they could illuminate yellow
yellow
yellow i like that idea
yeah
like if we like the one all the way on the left uh you ca you can see it on your computer better
mm
um where the button is actually blue but the number itself is clear or white or whatever so if you pressed it would illuminate yellow
mm
so we'd have blue and yellow for the touch buttons
oh that one
i like the yellow illumination idea very good
yeah
okay
any other ideas or thoughts
we all seem to be fairly in agreement about what we wanna do with this project so
um
ha hang on let me catch up
mm yeah
'kay
did we finalise what buttons we're including or we just everything that we said before
i think there will be time for that later
i'm guessing
'kay well we're gonna wrap this up
um next meeting is gonna start in thirty minutes
and here's what we're each of us going to do
the i. d. is going to do the look and feel design the u. i. d. the user interface design
i think you're going to get a lot of i mean the final say on what buttons get put we'll all talk about it
but i think that's pretty much what you're gonna do right
yeah
i guess
'kay
and you're gonna do some product evaluation
okay and right now the i. d. and u. i. d. you two are going to work together on a prototype using modelling clay
great
yeah
fun
play doh
okay and you should all be getting an email pretty soon
alright
well thank you for a very productive meeting
wonderful
ooh
i wanna find our if our remote works
me too
oh
okay
whoohoo
um here's the agenda for our last meeting
um after the opening we're going to have a prototype presentation then we're going to discuss the evaluation criteria and the financing of our remote
then we're going to evaluate the product and i think the whole production process and then we're gonna close it up and we have forty minutes so
let's get started
oh no let's have the prototype presentation
mm 'kay you ready
um sure
you or me
y you read that stuff since you wrote it
okay
well since our materials aren't exactly what we were going for i'm just gonna translate what this all means for you
i'll be the vanna
the base is gonna be gunmetal gray which is what we had decided and it's gonna be plastic
um then there's the latex cover which is what you see as red
um because it can be replaceable we just kinda went with the colour
right
um and then the buttons are actually kind of poking through rather than on top
um and the buttons will be a l much lighter blue almost see through
hmm
it's just sort of a very pale blue and a light up yellow
that's nice
yeah
the whole thing lights up if you press any button rather than it just that one button will light up
good
um and then at the bottom we have our logo
um bright yellow sort of design with the r. r. which will actually look like our logo
great
and then on the side you have the buttons
they're one button but they kind of push up and down
okay
i don't think they're scrolling
no
they're just buttons
right yeah
and then yeah the buttons
on off switch will be here and as you've noticed on our prototype um they've ended up with a curvature kind of
by concave sort of thing except for you know can't see underneath
yeah
so i'm hoping that when we get to production we can actually make them like that because they're very
nice to stock you know stick your finger in
yeah
um the two squared buttons are are two probably least used menu
thumb shaped
mute and then these are the numbers so our channel and our volume will be on either side
yeah
and then the last thing is just that it'll be black labelling on top just which we didn't do
okay
and did you determine um the curvature of the bottom part of it for the hand is it gonna be a single or a double
i'd say a single
single
single
single sounds good 'cause it's not big enough to really constitute a double
yeah
right
yeah it's only actually the size of my hand
great
great
i think you did an awesome job
yeah i think it's a beautiful
it is beautiful and it's everything that we discussed
yeah
good job you guys
good job
oh thank you
whoohoo
those are really good
alright what's next in our agenda
um we're gonna discuss the evaluation criteria and that's with courtney
okay it's a powerpoint presentation
i don't really know exactly what we should uh talk about
it's under evaluation
right
alright
um so these are the criteria we're gonna ask is it easy to use
is it fashionable uh yeah i guess we should write these down so we can reference them
mm
feel good meaning what
like does it feel good like yeah physically
physically okay
right
sqi
that's just for current trend
right
it doesn't really count you guys
yeah it was a little difficult to incorporate the cover with the cherry fruit on it
yeah
but it's so we do have removable covers right
right
yes
yeah well then that's covered
and so we n k everybody have that
'kay
i'll wait
yeah she's got it
it's good
yeah
yeah
okay so we're using the criteria uh for a seven point scale and so we need to discuss how we feel
it falls within this range so for easy to use
do we feel it's very easy to use
are we going to indi i say we individually rate what do you say
true or false easy to use
you guys
yeah
just orally
why not
we have okay
okay
um easy to use
i vote six
oh wait that's false
oh two
okay
i'd say two as well
yeah two
two
uh hello we're great
that's what i say
okay fashionable
um one
at the moment no
no
no
i mean like no i think it's very fashionable
me too very chic
i thi i would give it a one
okay
one i give it a one
i'll give it a two because at the moment it's not looking that way
well that's that's just like that's a clay it's a prototype
oh and ma it's a prototype right
what do you think
mm i don't think it's that fashionable
i'd give it like three or four
well now i'm
okay
so the average is about a two
yeah it's a two
but then i'm not fashionable so
two or three
don't use my opinion
two point five
that's okay
yeah
neither are all o all the customers we have either
um
does it feel good
imagine since we obviously don't have that
i feel like
does it feel good
uh the shape of it actually does uh
and it's i it is very ergonomically designed
it's gonna be curved
yeah it's gonna be thicker
yeah
depth
i think it feels good
i think so too
i'll give it a two
'kay
i'll give it a one
two
what do you say
i'd say a two
alright average is two
okay
is it technologically innovative
oh sorry i'm taking over your job here
oh no it's fine you're i mean you're project manager
go right ahead
um yeah i mean and it does it have voice i mean the phrase recognition on it
yes
right
we were able to do it with that kind of chip
oh right the
we could do it with the chip yes
it wasn't we have no reflection of it on the prototype but that's because it's only two dimensions really
and there's no way you can represent it on here
yeah right
y
that was 'kay
yeah so
and we discussed that being included
right
then yes then i would well it isn't what else would it need for it to be technologically innovative
it
well we don' have the you know we can't say channel and it changes the channel channel eight
and it doesn't cover anything other then t. v. so i'd probably give it a three
right
yeah
okay
even though it is for just a t. v. remote it's uh very advanced
but it is just a t. v. remote
yeah
i'd go for a three or four on that one so okay let's go for a three point five
yeah i go four
three and an half
alright and the last criteria is it is it um
squishy and fruity
well yeah so i'd give it a two
well we've covered that with the trendy
it's just trendy basically
it's capable of being squishy and fruity
sure
capable
oh it's very capable of being squishy and fruity
very capable
okay
and it's very important
yeah
'kay there we go
okay next
so
next
so um our re model slightly resembling a giant delicious cookie appears to be a winner and uh hopefully we'll sell millions
good job team
how did you get that in there
what
the slightly resembling a giant delicious cookie
it does
it it does
that was good
thanks
very good
alright let's go back to this
no that's it
hmm
oops
okay so now uh we're moving on to finance okay
i'm gonna show you an excel spreadsheet and we're going to fill it in together based on what components we're including in our remote and see if it's under twelve fifty euro
if so we can proceed if not we need to go back to the drawing board a little bit
'kay
so let me bring that up
here we go
alright
um it's not hand dynamo it's powered by battery so we give it a
yep
two
number of components you plan to use
do i just put quantity being one battery or
yeah
yeah
mm 'kay
but if it's a do you wanna go for this is where we need to make a final call on if it's a lithium or do we wanna go triple a. s
'cause triple a. s we're gonna have t do more than one battery
oh let's just go for a lithium
what do you say
yeah let's let's do a lithium
yeah it's
i think uh i think the people who purchase this are gonna be technologically right
we're gon that's gon
nologically advanced yeah
okay down to the electronics um section
we're gonna need this kind correct if we do the voice sensor so one of those
yeah
yep
it is a single curved so one of those
uh
oh
what's that
yeah that's correct
yeah
'kay down here case material
it's plastic
we plastic
plastic
and special colour
and special colour
'kay
down here interface type
we're gonna have the integrated scroll scroll wheel
no we don't have the scroll
isn't oh those are just regular buttons
but it's
well that's the push button too right there
buttons
yeah but i so i
this
integrated scroll wheel or push button
we're really having just push button interface
okay so we can just go um
but will we w actually we'll need two won't we
one for the top and then one for the s one e for each side
but it that just covers the type of button we're having
because we're not doing a scroll on the side it's still push button
oh like the twenty nine means like you have both scrolls and
push button
push buttons
okay
right i think she's i think what courtney's talking about is do we need to put two here
but we just have push
but we don't have any scrolls
like because there's like one interface right here and then because it's not gonna be on the same plane when you press the button
there's gonna have to be additional signals on the sides
right
yeah
so is that gonna be an extra one on each side
okay
i don't know they might put us well let's just
two interfaces is that what w should we s say
let's call it th
two or would it be three
or three because of one on each side and one on top
okay fine
yeah
i mean it's fine 'cause it comes out the same as twenty nine
well less than twenty nine even
okay
okay and we're gonna button supplements the buttons are no uh okay
they're a special colour
um they're uh they're a special form 'cause they're indented
are they
oh right
and then s yeah
and they're a special material
mm
well we're under cost then
alright
we're over
no we're under
grand
we're under
twelve point five is our limit
okay
oh i see
we've got eleven point two
so we can go to production
alright
we can go to
i dunno what i just did
okay
now we're gonna talk about the project process um and whether or not we're satisfied with the whole process and the result
um did we have a lot of room for creativity
did we have a lot of room for individual leadership um teamwork and the means
meaning the technology that we used to produce our little guy there and if we found any new ideas
now question is how do we do this
go back
i think we just discuss it
discuss sure
previous
alright
who want who would like to go first
we think we got stifled for cri creativity by the company itself in restricting us only to using a t. v. remote initially
we didn't have a whiteboard
hmm
yeah
oh that's true
hmm
and no internet
yeah
no yeah that's a good point
'cause i'd forgotten that that wasn't our decision yeah
and how did you feel about the whole the whole process though
oh overall i mean i thought we did a good job like
we got to choose basically we had control over minus it being just merely a t. v. remote we got to choose what we wanted to do with it
right and we got say over
what how technologically advanced it should be and also how fashionable which i kind of like we yep
and we're a fashion forward technology company
right
you know it
um what about um the teamwork aspect
how did you guys enjoy making the model the prototype
yeah
i think we did well
i think ya' did
did you work well together in there and 'kay
yep
well no there was there was scratching and fighting but no
minus that one fight
gouges
yeah
oh my god and we've all been a pretty congenial team here i think
yeah
we hadn't had any ma fallings out
i mean minus you guys being wha what is it the survey annoying or what is it
irritating
irritating
irritating yeah
irritating
wow that's a it's definitely a strong one
okay
the means the whiteboard didn't work
and no internet
yeah
yeah
i have to knock that one down a couple notches
a and our friend here really feels strongly about the internet
yeah and no internet
misses
i do
and the digital the digital pens were they were pretty cool
there's so much available
like it's information
yeah digital pens
i really appreciated those yeah
they were fine
yeah they were fun even though i'm not really sure what i could do with them but they are awesome
the use of the laptops for receiving everything
it was wireless too so
yeah
right laptops are extremely handy wireless
and these things whoa
and that we have a shared network where we can put all of the
yeah
and let's not forget the sexy dual microphones everyone gets to wear
yeah
and big brother
big brother
yeah
'kay have we found any new ideas through this process
um we are really gonna sell this
ta da
for something that looks cool and also has what i want it to b do technologically
yeah
and that's your right brain taking over w wanting the artistic the fashionable the hip you know
mm-hmm
if we all just went out and bought useful things i don't think i mean that's not what technology
well that's why i don't like uh macs or apples just 'cause i look at it and i know it's probably a very good computer
but i look at it and i'm taken back to elementary school 'cause they look the same
mm
they look like they did when i was in elementary school and that's so old fashioned to me
yeah
yeah 'cause they're pretty and just like
the toronto district school would only use his macs with their kids
yeah
exactly so i associate them with like really low tech really cheap bad
yeah
just the mac font bothers me even
uh yeah
yeah
but i do like ipods go figure
yeah no ipods they want all those words for presentation even the plugs
yeah
well i ipods are now quite trendy and they come in different colours
mm-hmm
colours
exactly
yeah
i mean how many people went out and bough a nokia phone back when we were like in high school
just so they could get the changeable face plates
oh yeah everybody
okay
mine is amber
anyway so that is definitely at work
not me
but the my but my one issue is just like the whole it's for t. v. only
i didn't have a phone 'til university
oh
i was like who's gonna buy a remote just for the t. v. unless they've lost theirs
look at it
yeah
that is a piece of work
fashionable chic people will
you're kidding
wow
no no
marketing director says yeah
fashionable people will buy it
no marketing has to actually create the desire for it
oh i will create desire
that's okay
we can create a commercial where they think that all their needs will be met
this will help them find the one
ri they'll be sexy with it
hmm
we could have like an adam and eve type commercial and that's the fig leaf
that's right
oh right
mm
and so the serpent says use our remote
that'll sell
there you go marketing
let you loose
yeah
alright
yeah no
yeah
okay we're gonna wrap this up now
um the costs are within the budget we evaluated the project and now we're gonna complete the final questionnaire and meeting summary
and then we're going to have a big giant party apparently according to this so
whoohoo
alright thank you team you did a great job it was lovely working with you
margaritas for everyone
good
you too
yay
thanks to the project leader
now we know w
right w welcome to the the first meeting of uh real reaction's uh um development meetings for our our new television remote control
uh this follows our very successful entry into the the consumer market over the last year or so um which we want to to build on
taking advantage of the uh the the latest developments in in technology and the uh the latest uh uh feelings in in consumer design and and demand and uh we want to make this the the very best product th that's possible for everybody
uh one that everybody wants uh at a good price for the consumer and at a good price for the company
uh and to that end we need all to work together uh to do that
um and uh b in no particular order because ev everybody is uh just as vital to this project um i'll just go round th the table andrew
mm
marketing um m kendra with the uh um designing the the the user interface uh uh and kate with the the industrial design
um
what's uh the the th th project is is here to do is is to to get this this project up and moving
ev everybody is is free to uh say wh whatever they want uh everybody has a contribution to make and uh
everybody feel free to interrupt me at any time to to say what you want to say
um in in terms of the immediate meeting the uh um everybody knows everybody else
everybody's worked for the the company for a while if if an anybody feels that they need to say more about themselves please do
if if if anybody wants to b briefly give their their background so that everybody's quite clear what everybody uh uh everybody's experience is please do so
uh
in fact i'd i'd i'd welcome anybody to uh say something briefly about themselves
in fact we will do that by by going round the table quickly and and saying what what contribution you you're looking to make
so we'll start with andrew
oh my name's andrew i'm a i'm the market research
person for this uh for this meeting and this uh project for creating this new remote control and uh yeah i'll be uh presenting information statistics on what people want to want to uh get from this new design
what people want to like and from a fashion point of view and the practicality point of view
right kendra
i'm kendra and i'm the us user interface designer and um i haven't had a whole lot of experience in this kind of thing before but i'm m so i'll be
working on the design
right at least means you haven't got any preconceived ideas so
right
yep i'm just open to being creative
uh i'm katie i'm the industrial designer and i'll just be i guess presenting about the the inter workings of our little remote control and uh yeah
yep good
okay very very quickly
um this i don't want to make this meeting too structured because the the whole idea is that it's a um you know a think tank
everybody says what they what they want to say
uh and we don't want to be constrained by uh kind of convention or uh uh slides on screens or or anything else um but um briefly um th th this is what we want to do
the the remote control needs to be original
there has to be something about it that uh other remote controls don't have so that as soon as people see it they think um yes that's different
uh i want one um and that goes along with being trendy uh uh you know the i want it
uh scenario
user friendly as as we all know
remote controls can be uh uh very user unfriendly so we want to make ours one that people can pick up and think oh yes that's it's obvious how that works
uh and they also want to look at the price and think oh yeah that's something that i may not need another remote control but uh it's such a nice one i'm gonna have one
and last but not least or indeed first of all it it must make the company money
and we make the company money by producing what the consumer wants
the uh the further work to be done is i the um the functional design uh what it uh what it must actually do
the uh conceptual design uh how we actually present that to the consumer and th the the detailed design i is uh how we get that into production
uh now th the main design tool that we have available to us at the moment is is the white board and uh uh let us very quickly do what i what it says in the in the in the prompt slide here
um
in fact i suggest to avoid everybody untangling themselves from the uh the the wires that we don't do that um
so i i everybody knows what whiteboard is so we'll um uh we'll do a virtual drawing on the on on the whiteboard of of your your own uh uh favourite animal
but le let's go round the table your favourite animal
um badger
mm and why
uh it's it's got nice contrast with black and white and uh i feel they're underdog kind of status and they're the
uh-huh
oh right uh my my wife says my beard looks like a badger's arse 'cause of the the white streaks in it
um probably a duck i just i li i like the way they look and they're just nice animals and i like how they can fly or swim or walk around or whatever
kendra
uh-huh
right okay
uh 's horses no particular reason why
uh-huh fair enough yeah
i'm not sure that i've got any favourite animal to be quite honest i think homo sapien because of their their uh overall ability to uh uh
make mobile phones and t. v. remotes to make t. v. remotes
sorry
indeed absolutely yes tha that's um
okay and uh w we need to keep in mind here that the uh we want to sell this for for twenty five euro um
we want to m make an overall profit for the the company of fifty million euros so we're we're looking at selling a lot of these um ag across the the entire planet and and we're looking at a gross profit of fifty percent
it needs to cost twelve euros fifty to make
um so we're not only looking at a a very trendy original product we're looking at making it at a very good price
um okay um would anybody like t like to to start by giving their o um sort of quick views of of current remote controls
well i think i find a lot of them really complicated to use with all the different buttons and uh it's handiest when you have one that works both the d. v. d. player or whatever and the t. v. as well
um
but that it's easy to if you can switch back and forth instead of having to press a bunch of different buttons and so i think it's is best when they're clearly labelled and you can see which buttons you're supposed to use
no
you know
any any thoughts about buttons or any oth other way of approaching the p the uh the problem
or anybody else strong feelings about remote controls
are there you know bad ones they've used or good ones they've used or ones that they've lost and never found again
um
i think it's important that you should be able to when you when you press the buttons it'll actually pick up the signals from kind of anywhere and you shouldn't have to like contort yourself and twist your remote control to get it the t. v. to actually pick up the signal
yeah
yeah
think a lot of the time remotes that come with t. v. players and t. v. s and d. v. players like they aren't
mm
like an area that's put a lot of effort into they're very boring very plain
like it's very a very like um making a a stylish remote control would be a very like
mm
easily put us one step ahead of the current competition
um what so wh what's in in what particular style features are you thinking about
um
something that looks looks doesn't look like remote control
so if you want something that looks like uh something that makes you think oh what's this
like this pen doesn't really look like a pen but it makes you think oh
uh-huh
so sorry that's a bit vague
yeah d no i mean do you think there's a risk if it doesn't look like remote control people won't see it as a remote control um and uh
uh i suppose suppose that's up to the marketing to
to make make people aware of the product
uh-huh
any other thoughts about um th the physical appearance of a of remote controls
i think something that's comfortable to hold because sometimes you get the remote controls that are just those big
mm
rectangular things and uh they're kind of awkward to hold onto so something that's more comfortable that fits in a person's hand better
mm
i mean th the thing that i immediately comes to mind is computer mouses which um i mean y you get all sorts of shapes in the shops and s you know some quite fancy ones um than the some from personal experience which look nice but aren't particularly comfortable
mm
yeah
yeah
mm
yeah
yeah
um any thoughts about buttons or flat screens or uh uh
well from the mouse idea you could remote is a piece of plastic with the big rubber buttons sticking out of it which you press
whereas if you want could all be flat and the buttons are very kind of almost subtle that instead of being raised out of the device uh you push into device you see
like a mouse button
yes i mean the only thing is if if you're watching television in a in a a darkened room um you need to be able to uh
mm
i suppose
fi find the button buttons easily
easily yeah yeah
but maybe they could be concave instead of sticking up to have them be kind of down so you could feel them
mm
mm
better
yeah that's uh must admit i don't think i've ever seen one with concave buttons that's uh certainly be different
um do we need it to uh i can't think of any re remote controls that i know of that actually light up at all
oh yeah
do we do we want uh
mm that would be good
like a like a mobile phone
yeah
mm
yeah
mm yeah that would be good
mm
okay
so
andrew have you had any thoughts yet about how we might market something which there are already millions out there and that we want to uh uh uh t take over the entire
um the planet with
mm-hmm um especially if we try to sell what two million of them
oh sorry four million of 'em but uh
i think if w if we market it as as not as not well this you c you could either market it as the point of view we could have the two we could have parallel marketing s schemes where you've got one where it appeals to people that want to have the new device that looks cool
mm
is fashionable and like you just it's it's like uh it's one that rather than ra i wan i want rather than a kind of a need relationship with the device
mm-hmm
but that might considering the act what the device is for and the nature of some people might not like respond to having a device that they just looks nice
therefore they want it so make it practical at the same time
i think it's this is gonna have to appeal to people that want device that can enhance their living room uh but also a device that uh
mm-hmm
is practically sound
mm-hmm
so um i dunno we'll have to decide which which angle we're gonna go to or both
okay yeah yeah well i d i think an any uh any facets that we identify w we aim need to aim for for all of
if you
mm
um okay well first thoughts on um
the the industrial design side
oh i think it's it's remote controls are kind of a unique object 'cause it's you depend on them so much
but you don't i i it's you sort of just assume they're always gonna work
you don't think of them as a comp like a computer can break down and you're kinda like oh well fair enough there's all these complex things going on
it's gonna something's gonna get messed up eventually
they they just need to be very very dependable because people sort of take them for granted and then if your remote control breaks it's
god forbid you actually get up and manually change the channel it just it needs to be very effective very always dependable
indeed
uh i don't think we should make it too small i 'cause i think it needs to it can't be too big like you were saying big an and huge and um awkward
but also if you make it too small kinda like you know how mobile phones are getting smaller and smaller um
it's just gonna end up under a couch cushion somewhere and um yeah
yeah
but so yes dependable and have a good medium range size
okay and um colours materials
kendra anyone
well most i think most of the remote controls now are either just black or grey
so maybe we should go with something different or be able to i was just thinking of um what they're doing with mobile phones now how you can get the different um what are they called
like the face plates that you change so we could have maybe i don't know if it would be feasible to do something with that
yeah
mm mm-hmm
where you can change the face plates or have kind of a variety so people can get different different things
uh-huh
have it kind of look how they want to different colours things like that probably just plastic because that's always the lightest
right
yeah
okay that's uh
again i don't think that's ever been done before
it's uh the sort of the sort of thing that would get people uh thinking yes that's something that i haven't got and uh
mm-hmm
might need so
uh andrew any thoughts about uh how we might market interchangeable fronts on on the remote control
um well we could either market it together by getting control in a set colour or with like you buy it with several
uh like
you ge you get the f uh the face plates with it when you buy or as a separate thing
but uh maybe thinking of that it's considering the nature of the device
maybe a second thing like a second campaign to market new facials for your to your might go a bit astray since it is the kind of thing where y you generally get one and then forget about it
mm
yeah
unless you were trying to
yeah
well you could come up with like novelty ones like they've done with the the mobile phones
i think
you can get like different you know scenes from different movies and stuff on the remote control and sorta stagger the release of them and get people like oh i want that cover on it now and that'll keep them spending money
mm
yeah
oh it's that's a that's a good idea
yeah
mm mm
mm
right okay i think we've got um a good idea now
yeah true
we uh meeting is uh
needs to be k uh wrapped up fairly quickly
so uh um we've got thirty minutes to
start looking at the um at the design in more detail
um
then we'll we will reconvene in in thirty minutes and try to get some of these ideas uh
uh more formalised
uh thank you very much indeed
okay
thank you
okay welcome to the second meeting of this uh design group
um
i'll briefly go through the uh
notes of the of the last meeting
uh just done in in note form and i haven't attributed anything to individuals
because we're working strictly as a team here and uh n nobody's working equally so uh
sorry
um we we s we saw that the the problems with existing remote controls were the uh b a boring shape and boring colour
um and and we s we saw that the um what we needed to do was to to make sure the device um controls several items
that switching was easy
that you shouldn't need to point the thing at uh anything in particular um that it need to be contoured to make it interesting
that the keys might be concave simply because that hasn't been done before that we know of
um should have interchangeable fascias so people can personalise it um illuminated so that people can see it in dark rooms
um and that people might want it as as in addition to their existing remote controls
um and that it sh it should just always work whenever you uh um
mm uh use it
and that it shouldn't be too small mm that it it gets lost
um
now uh
uh i'll shortly ask for for three three presentations
uh before i do that however
i will go through some new project requirements that um the the management have placed on us and uh will be challenging in terms of what we discussed at the first meeting
um the uh
the ma the management has had it's own thoughts on this and uh the they don't necessarily agree with with what we uh we thought
um and and then we'll as a result of that we will then talk through the the functions that we see the the device um actually b carrying out
and we have uh forty minutes to do this in and i uh
anyway
okay
now
the n the new requirements are um the the management team see that um teletext is no longer of any importance given the uh the rise of the internet
um and and they want it only to cover televisions
um now
what is not q quite clear from their directive is whether they mean th they don't want it to cover teletext or whether they don't want it to cover
you know
videos d. v. d. s um satellite boxes which uh i mean we saw as being fundamental to the uh to the exercise
the um the actual wording of the directive is that it should cover television only
um and on that basis um i i think we we need to bear that in mind
um but possibly uh keep at the backs of our minds that the reality that people even when they uh no longer they don't look at teletext anymore
they certainly do look at other things
um the device has to incorporate the company logo and colours
um the the logo uh being at b the bottom of the screen there the the the two r. s in grey against uh a yellow background
um now this doesn't necessarily mean that we have to give up some of our ideas about making it attractive to the t to the market
but uh do do introduce some some constraints as to how we might do that
um it also has to be simple which to some extent goes along w with the first one
and that we've already said that it must be simple 'cause that's what people want anyway
um but they also want it to be simple to get it to the market quickly which um
mm uh is is is their choice but uh um we we need to talk that through
um okay so uh
after the meeting it'll be summarised and uh
um notes sent out and uh etcetera
okay so we'll first of all mm have individual reports from everybody
um again i there is no order of precedence here um so i i i'll leave it up to you to who who who thinks they would like to go go first
uh i don't mind
p fine
uh can i steal the cable
oh sorry you can indeed
cheers
i got a how do i start there
oh if you click on the um uh the one that that looks like a projection screen no the one to the right of that
that one
that one
cool
well these are functionality requirements from the our our guys down in the the research lab
took hundred people and covered all the aspects of what um is needed by people and what they want to see
um everything kinda from functionality and how individual functions are how mu how how often they're used and how much their necessary and stuff
and general opinions about current current remotes
see that as we kinda noticed seventy five percent of people find their remote controls ugly
so some kind of a new style should be incorporated that's less ugly
uh along with um looking less ugly if it looks better eighty percent of people said they'd spend more money on it
which is a a plus for us if we can make it look better it'd be uh
more cost effective
and we can put the price up
current remote controls do not match the operating behaviour of the user
i can empl i kinda take that to mean as um
they
they don't uh they yeah
they only use they only work for the television or yeah like as in in my flat i've got six remote controls for a stereo system
a digital box a d. v. d. player a video player and t. v.
if it was uh i mean th my behaviour is to use multiple things at the same time and multiple remotes aren't really matched well to my behaviour
uh again seventy five percent is seventy five percent of users say they zap a lot
i took to mean that they just they use it a lot they use it regularly rather than standing up and
manually change channels or volume
and uh
yeah uh i think the big issue is fifty percent users only use ten percent of the buttons
'cause uh wh if we got a remote that like well we'll have some buttons taken off by the lack of teletext
but uh oh and we're going to see uh on the uh that some of the functions like audio settings aren't h hardly ever used and used very aren't considered relevant by the user
so i think maybe fewer buttons which also make the design look sleeker i dunno
uh um yeah and
uh frustrations of like people losing remote control
i dunno maybe some kind of system of you press a button on the t. v. or maybe that's b it would have to incorporate
mm
but like some kind of system where you can f use something else to find the remote control
maybe like it'll beep or something
and um yep the uh time taken to learn new remote controls is
uh don't want to make it too complicated easy to use for uh new like first time users and stuff
and uh repetitive strain injury i suppose we should make it more comfortable and make ma possibly even use have to make it
yeah fewer buttons like i was saying about the whole mice the mouse idea of it feels more comfortable
maybe don't even have to hold it as such
mm
gosh must be some telly addicts out there if they get r. s. i. from their television remote is all i can say
but uh yeah
it also asked um if we would if people would pay more for speech recognition and younger people say they would
and uh there was another section on our on the report for uh l. c. d. displays but the data wasn't there so
i don't actually know what the results for that were so
mm
right
mm
may be incrementally emitting but yeah
yeah i must say that um the uh i c can't remember what um f you know phone service i was using the other day
but that had sorta speech recognition which worked uh remarkably well so that is indeed a uh
um
and uh it would cut out the r. s. i. as well if you
a thought and it it cuts out uh
i was was gonna say you can't get a lot of r. s. i. j just get jaw ache
okay sorry
yeah um oh yeah so possibly the speech recognition is possibly something could add into the design
oh i've got some other things i couldn't fit onto this presentation
um
you see this okay
almost no
it's sorry it's a bit
i'll read out to you
uh functionality uh like people's opinions on functionality the relevance to the remote and how often they're used
so um
like the power
using the using the d swi the power switch to switch on t. v. is a high relevance of nine but it's not frequently used
you see what i mean
whereas channel selection which is very high relevance is used the most
yeah
mm-hmm
so m we can maybe even start to cut down on or i was possibly even thinking of a design that maybe some of the buttons are hidden from everyday use
maybe like uh a folding ledge or something
so that we can maybe go into the channel settings and the audio settings which are low relevance and rarely used
mm
and keep the v volume selection and channel selection very easily
mm-hmm
it could be oh uh i was just gonna say uh maybe like the flip phones that they use
i mean
have you seen the new mo mobile phones that flip out and they have the like texting and then the numbers on one side
mm
yeah
oh yeah
so you could have the most used buttons on top and flip it out or something
mm
hmm-hmm
mm
yeah like the one that like slides back and the buttons are concealed underneath
uh
yeah
should we actually bite the bullet here
mm
if people really don't use those buttons to any extent at all um remove them altogether
just remove them completely
that might be the
we we could actually have we could actually have a remote control with um
i wonder whether we could get the remote control with no buttons at all if we went for voice recognition given that um the
um now the the age structure we were looking at um i mean w we had usage by age structure
what we didn't have was what proportion of people using remotes were in those particular age groups
now do we know whether they
uh yeah
forty no sorry for forty five to fifty five age group uh to put myself right in the middle of it
um u use remote controls to a great extent
yes we
um no this is for pay more for speech recognition
that would 've speech recogn right
so we're looking at um well again we don't know the relative proportion the relative numbers in the age groups
yeah that's true
if we wanted something
different truly different then the buttonless remote control w would be it
p
well the only problem i can think of with that is if you've got a lot of people that don't wanna be bothered learning how to use new rem remote controls
if you just kind of take away everything that they're used to knowing that's gonna be quite a change
but if you just lift it up and say channel one or b. b. c.
it might
or even i mean you could even just have it left on
you could just put it down once on top your t. v. and never have to
maybe i
yeah
have a big kind of like the satellite box or the cable box and have it just go on the t. v. and then it doesn't matter where in the room you are
you won't lose it
yeah
mm
it c well it i can i can see technical problems with that in terms of the you know
mm
no
the sound from the television because if somebody actually on the television says uh uh you know
b. b. c. one
yeah
oh
i. t. v. and you're watching b. b. c. then then it might um change itself so it probably needs to be um possibly actually need a button on it
yeah
yeah that's true
just to activate it
oh yeah
or or something just to identify that you've lifted it up and it's use
and and then just say oh i don't know a thought and and then uh i mean that that would certainly be uh truly different
yeah
um 'cause uh you know audio settings nought point eight percent
i mean if they weren't there
mm mm
would people miss them
but look at the importance of them
the volume settings
relevance of two out of ten yeah
vol volume yes um th w we need to s identify things that people actually need and and it's a function of frequency and relevance
yeah
they're not used often but they are quite important when they're used
yeah
and um i would say ignoring ig ignoring power for the moment
um the channel and volume and th w w given given that we've been told to ignore teletext
mm
yeah
uh channel and volume are the only ones that
uh would appear to be essential
stand out
um
so we if we can design something that that looks interesting
know or looks different
um incorporates the the logo and and the colours and um we can still have our interchangeable fascias even if it's the yellow and grey um
and uh i dunno buttons or or buttons as an option
uh i just had a thought actually sorry to interrupt
do please
uh you were saying about um it could technical problems of like uh someone on the television saying a channel number and it changed we could maybe have like an activation
mm-hmm
word
'cause i've seen i've seen this used on computers before where you just you address the remote you address the computer and then give it a command
you cer certainly could
mm
depe uh i depends whether um if we want to make this
so simple that anybody can walk into the room and lift it up and say
oh i see
oh yeah i see
b. b. c. one
um okay i mean you could
print actually print it on the uh
mm-hmm yeah
device itself
um
i mean i'm just thinking of the point of view of peop you could still like lose this remote
s th this i th that's always gonna be a problem i think
mm
um and i i i s so i suppose one um
could make it so desirable that if people lose it they immediately go out and buy another one
anyway sorry carry on
do you want to just carry on with
oh no i i interrupted you sorry
or no no no uh b i was in the middle of in the middle of your report there
oh okay
um well i was just kinda wrapping up there
yeah i was thinking um yeah maybe such things are relevant
mm okay
we could make things much more f i think the the eighty percent of people would spend more on uh a remote uh that looks better
combined with uh decrease the or take out the limited functio functions that we don't really use much
alright take out teletext but as for channel settings and stuff it might it might um turn people somewhe peop some people that want the whole functionality away
but since if we're marketing a more kind of fashionable approach then it'd it would be fashion and fashion over practicality
mm-hmm
s s we could we could make it dual function voice recognition and still have buttons on it um 'cause we're
oh we could yeah
we c yeah
we could even have it as like a yeah the buttons control this and the voice functions control the f things that you would do all the time
so
certainly could
so uh yeah if we could uh power on and channel selection and and volume selection wouldn't have to really
mm
yeah yeah
the i mean the the advantage of doing away the buttons altogether is it makes the thing cheaper
yeah and probably it would look better as well
no it cou certainly opens up the possibility for making it uh you know visually very distinctive
yeah
um 'cause you know it does not have to be a oblong box
yeah
mm
lined with numbered buttons and
mm yeah
okay who sorry have you have you finished there andy
uh yeah yeah that's everything
yep yep
um given that we've already had a extensive discussion uh
okay well i can do mine
hmm
do you want the cable
yeah let's see if i can make this work
um
oh you have to hit like function and f. something
oh
f. eight
f. eight
is it doing
dunno
uh give it about twenty seconds or so
okay
ah there we go
oh yeah it's going
oh okay
okay so this is just about the technical functions
alright
so the method
i looked online for examples of other similar products and then just kind of was trying to brainstorm some possible design ideas and um identify what the necessary things are
what people are what you really wanna have a remote control do
um and then there are two different kinds that i found
there's a user centred one and an engineering centred one which i will have pictures of and then we kinda have to decide which one this should be
mm-hmm
so these are the two different ones
this one um this is the user centred it has uh quite a few mm uh um fewer buttons and then this is the engineering centred
which has a lot more buttons and probably this is one that people complain about about having too many buttons that you don't use
mm-hmm
so basically what a remote control is is you it's to send messages to the television set
you know turn on off switch the channels and the volume and things such as that
and so for this product it's gonna be television only and then it has to have the uh logos
for the company and the colours
and so for my personal preferences i think this one is easier to use and has quite a you know fewer buttons
um we want something that sends messages easily to the television and i was kind of wondering about this example that they have
it looks kind of narrow at the top and i was thinking maybe if it were wider at the top then that would be easier
mm yeah
um and so we have to decide what's gonna make our product different
e the unique style maybe have it light up so it's visible in the dark
um the changeable face plates and the lighting up and visible i was when we were talking about havi losing it
maybe to have a button on the television that you press and it maybe if it makes a noise or lights up or something like that
so it's easier to find if someone has hidden under the couch or something like that
so that's my presentation
yeah
okay can i um i'm actually gonna use the um it's gonna cause great technical problems over here
i'm actually gonna use the
f they probably clip to you
oh yeah they might be movable
yeah
oh yeah they're all they're not connected to anything on the table you just leave 'em on and walk around with 'em
yes rather than the uh the the traditional in fact um i won't even go that far
um something like this shape you know
sort of something that you can that's sort of a more vertical shape
um that you you sort of hold in your hand um well i'm trying to think
uh uh uh l uh l such as i mean um something you hold up like that possibly with a couple of buttons like that
but with the the entire top with the you know the uh the infrared or whatever source
mm
uh so that you know it's
flying off in all directions so that uh um uh again the n need to look at the the the technicalities of um
mm
actually achieving that in terms of whether the you know the power requirements of the uh such a source
um you know compromise the our our need for uh you know it it being
um mm permanently
uh you know available
uh whether whether different technology um i mean th all all these remotes are presumably infrared and like they have been for a long time
uh we we possibly need to be looking at at at something different um you know short range
not like the old uh radio remote controls where you'd change next door's telly when you change yours
um
but uh uh i think basically i if we're going for i if minimum number of buttons is our priority then we should as i say
r know really bite the bullets and and reduce the buttons to absolute minimum you know possibly with backup channel and volume buttons and on off
um and nothing else
um so that it can al it could uh almost end up like that but again except that um you know the risk of losing it
um anyway okay um so kate wh what are your uh your thoughts on this
yes mm
oh
which one does this plug into
hmm i think it's all there
that one
h
i can't did you could you see it on you screen when it
oh yeah
that's kind of strange
that's not cool
oh well
anyways
um alright yeah so um i'll just do my presentation on the working design uh
oh there we go
okay um just at the m yeah the whole sort of method of how the remote control works
uh the basic function of the remote control is to send messages to another sh system the the t. v. or the d. v. d. player or whatever
um and it does this uh by well
you need to start off you need an energy source and this energy source will feed into an integrated circuit chip and the circuit chip is the part that actually composes the different messages uh within the remote um which will then be sent to the uh the television
the d. v. d. to tell that what to do
um and you need a user interface
which controls the chip and thus the messages and uh the user interface is that's basically just you kn the s sorta design of the actual remote which you hold in your hands and what buttons will be on it
um
oh shoot
okay
uh just general findings
uh what we need uh technically speaking for the remote control is some sort of energy source
uh some sort of user interface which i think we've mostly been talking about the user interface and the design of that
um a circuit chip within that to uh control and send the messages and um a sender and receiver
and um oops
uh-huh
this is just sort of a little schematic diagram of what we're looking for
uh this just kinda represents the energy source which feeds into the circuit chip uh which maybe then we could have that feed into a switch which would send signals f to um a subcomponent and on to a light bulb between so it'll light up once we start once you start pressing buttons
hmm
um also send signals to the um infrared bulb which will be the part that actually what
sends signals to the the television
and then you've got your happy little t. v. watcher there
and so my personal preferences i i just think we need sorta big uh energy source that won't die out
uh perhaps some sort of rechargeable battery or a battery dock you could place it in
so it'd constantly be charged so you wouldn't have to uh be worrying about it running out of batteries and not changing channels for you
uh a wide range uh sender receiver so that you can hit the buttons from basically anywhere in the room and the channel'll still be changed
uh also definitely a user friendly interface um and i think we've all sort of mentioned adding a a locating device on it
so when it does get stuck under the couch cushions as they inevitably do you can find them easily
and that's pretty much it
okay
uh it seems seems to me there are a number of fundamental decisions to make before we um i think your point about the the big energy source is uh a very valid one
mm
mm
um i don't suppose we've got any statistics on the the life expectancy of uh remote controls particularly sort of independent ones
um given
you know the number of things you buy these days which you know have a a a lithium whatever battery in
that's uh you know never needs replacing
um perhaps we should have the the disposable remote control uh um you know one some sort of typical usage
you know the the the battery will last
know five ten years
by which time i mean when all's said and done the digital television
will be taking over in that time scale
mm
mm-hmm
um
uh uh p perhaps we should know reduce the uh you know
the sort of moving parts even more by not even having a battery compartment and uh
just having one that's guaranteed to last five to ten years
yeah and if if anybody manages to run it down we'll we'll give 'em a new one
oh cool
yeah fair enough
um it's you know it's what it saves in cost and you know there there's a well it's actually a marketing gimmick
i mean it's hardly a gimmick it's uh it's totally practical
uh so i th think you know the idea of a rechargeable one is um
uh unless you're really high tech and it sort of just recharges itself if it's n by you know magnetic waves or whatever if if it
it could have like uh know like a cordless phone in your house it s got like a base that sits there all the time
yeah
mm mm
are are people really gonna use it though
i suppose yeah
yeah people are pro i would think that people might forget i mean people forget to put their cordless phones back on there so
um
mm yeah
i i th i think
mm mm
yeah
yeah
it's um i mean i know that somei times my my wife goes out in the morning and says oh i should have put the phone on to charge and then then she's had those for so long that if she hasn't worked that out by now
mm
um
'cause i only remember to charge my cell phone uh when battery dies
yeah
and that's pretty much yeah
when it yeah wh when it's died is a problem
yeah when it turns itself off that's when i plug it in yeah
yeah yeah yeah so uh um what so wh what what do we think about the um the the permanent mm battery
yeah think that's a good idea
uh
that sounds pretty good yeah
no
is the uh you know we we we are really going for the ultimate in ex uh external simplicity here
um
mm
um you know cut cost within the
manufacturing and uh
you know if we have a high tech interior then then that that sh may well be cost effective
do they make batteries that last that long
i mean th th certainly
um i can't think of anything off the s top of my head but there are certainly things that you buy
i mean calculators for example
they usually have the little light uh source i dunno what the heck they're called the but yeah the little cells that
yeah they have that little solar
som well some do i mean th th but there are battery ones that um are you know sort of permanently sealed
yeah
mm-hmm
mm
yeah
in in fact i'd
most of them don't they have sort of a combination of the two
like when there is light they'll work off the light and if there isn't
yeah uh uh
they'll kick into this battery so we can maybe do something like that whereas there is a battery
but if there's enough light then it's using the light so that it's not actually draining the battery all the time
mm
but you will have the battery there for when you need it
yeah i i mean th th this needs going t into the technology a bit
mm
i mean the the actual time that a remote control is actually operating
mm
i would think is
i is is probably you know no more than minutes in its entire life
oh it depend if it's uh depends who who's using it who's just sitting there clicking clicking clicking clicking yeah
um
yeah some people are
if but i say if if people are getting r. s. i. from it then uh then uh then then perhaps we're looking at the wrong market n
yeah then they're clicking a lot yeah
yeah
yeah
w like like this um this uh market research thing says number of times per hour that it's used channel selection a hundred and sixty eight
per hour
times per hour
right
yeah
yeah
wow
that's a lot
yeah
oh i must admit i hadn't um i'd i'd missed that
that does sound excessive
but then again if you think it of the amount of you know amount of use it's like
yeah
that's it's less than a second um
yeah
yeah
yeah
well that's right
and and i i don't i don't even know whether the i don't even know whether the s the signal lasts as long as you actually keep the button pressed
mm
or whether it's just a
yeah
sorta tenth of a second no matter how long you press it for i don't know i don't actually know
though i think with digital t. v. like i know on my cable box
um
you're not supposed to do that because the channel can't keep up with it if you just press it like that
yeah
mm
so you're supposed to use the menu and go through the different
mm-hmm
mm-hmm
channels that way instead of
mm
right so i've got a message to say five minutes i dunno how long ago that appeared
um 'cause we're we're getting um right so i'd i need to sum up very quickly here um
uh oh
we're looking at extreme simplicity
we're looking at a
radically different shape
possibly no buttons at all um but if you can incorporate um
channel change and volume buttons um in into the design then then that's fine
um in the i mean the the role of the of the um the user interface des designer becomes b you know more important here
because you know shape is no longer an
a uh um a serious constraint
but we clearly only need th the main buttons although uh if clearly only need the main functions
um i don't see why we shouldn't go for voice recognition um and the the only buttons that i think we need are channel control
volume control and on off
um it needs to incorporate the corporate logo uh the the grey and yellow colour scheme and there's no reason why we can't introduce um interchangeable
uh covers
um uh d so does that accurately summarise what we've discussed
yeah
yeah
yep
hmm
right
um
so uh
oh i just have one question
yeah
so are we doing just the television or are we doing so not d. v. d. players we okay okay
we are doing just the television
no
i think that's quite clear from the the information that we've been given no
mm
okay
yeah like in the email of television only
in fact they're in the constraints email that i got
right
didn't you mention the teletext just television only
oh yeah well th that's one i s that's one i sent you
mm
yeah
which which was my interpretation of uh of the uh what came down from from head office
oh okay
yeah
oh yeah
oh okay
okay
um
that's that that that that's their uh their view
okay so uh we can all give some thought to that uh for for the next meeting thank you very much indeed
okay
cool
alright
alright
thank you for coming to this third meeting of the uh uh design group
um i think we uh made some definite progress at the last one um and come up with some interesting uh uh w suggestions for our our new remote control
um i'll again very quickly uh just present some notes of that meeting
um the the the problem with existing remote controls we felt was that they're ugly um and that people are prepared to pay a premium for something better
um they've got lots of buttons on them that uh people don't use and find difficult to learn
um and people lose them
and
we we thought that f for our our new uh uh remote control that everybody will want to rush out and buy
um that we're we should look at speech recognition rather than r rather than buttons
and that if we have any buttons they should be very few of them and only for those functions that are actually identified that that people use
that um we want to go for uh a long lasting battery that we gua we guarantee for the life of the uh uh the product and a shape that will be instantly recognisable
a. um as uh a trendy remote control and and b. as uh a real reaction product
so that w uh when people are uh happy with that they will they will want to buy uh everything else from us
uh
okay
so again um
i'll we'll have the three three presentations from the the the three of you and then uh we'll we'll make a a final a final uh decision
um and the the decisions that we need to to make today finally
are um what energy source we want to use whether i it is practical to use uh um
a a a long lasting one
and uh i i think our discussion was around the fact that uh if we're gonna go for uh a long lasting power supply
then basically it's uh sealed for life and uh if anybody does manage to run one down we'll we'll give them another one
and uh it it'll be uh you know prominently displayed as part of the th the advertising literature that it's um um
you know for life guaranteed for life
um now the the the internal chip um and uh this is where i need uh uh kate's expert advice and given that th this has to to go to market as quickly as possible um d d do we go for a custom designed chip
or or do we buy one off the shelf and and programme it ourselves
uh i mean i'm i'm i'm
n not an expert on these things but presumably there must be loads of 'em already on the market that we can modify
but uh that that's uh that's your area of expertise
and then the uh you know the the overall design of the case uh is is is kendra's field and uh
we we had some discussions last time as as to uh how we might go forward and we'll we'll finalise those
uh da today
um and thi this is all linked in with the the the user interface whether we p um
go for voice buttons or or a bit of both
uh
and then uh you know f for the next meeting kate will be looking at the the the s the look
feel and design kendra the uh
ho how the the user actually uses it and and andrew of course the the product evaluation
and uh kate and kendra will be producing a a model for us to uh to look at
uh so if if we can have the the three presentations again please and uh um p perhaps you'd like to start uh k
okay
um
kate
oh i'm sorry oh sorry
um p there we go
'kay i'll just be talking about the components design
and
okay basically i just uh looked at what exactly do remotes do
uh basically they wait for you to press a key or give a voice command and then this is translated uh into uh light signals which are then seen by the t. v.
uh the materials we're gonna need to look at uh the two big ones are the integrated circuit chip and the battery and the in integrated circuit chip uh works in conjunction with a a diode transistor or resonator
uh two more resistors and a capacitor and the battery works in conjunction with a resistor and a capacitor
um
uh basically what happens is you'll press a number or give a voice command and this creates a a connection within the the remote that allows the chip the chip then senses this connection and produces a signal in a morse code format
this signal's sent to the transistor which amplifies it and then sends it on to the light emitting diode and uh which is then trai changed into a infrared light which is sent to the t. v. and sort of seen by the t. v. and which uh changes the channels
um
oh
uh cool
uh so as for how we should end up uh using this in our remote uh t couple of main questions are the buttons
uh y the fewer buttons you have i guess the fewer internal connections and internal codes you're gonna need
um
however uh to n not have buttons or to use a voice commands instead of buttons might make these connections more difficult and uh raise the production cost
that's something we should think about
also we have to work within the company constraints
and the company has informed me via email that uh they're experts at pushbuttons and that seems to be the most uh cost effective way of producing it
um also with battery connections the company has some limits on the batteries we can use
so i was thinking perhaps a combination of solar cells with a back up basic battery and somehow between the combination of that two we might be able to come up with something that uh will last the the lifetime or the five to ten years and we could still keep that original idea
um we also need to look at the chips uh v custom designed versus off the shelf
and the custom designed will give us much more flexibility and enable us to incorporate the voice function that we all uh seem to have agreed upon
um however that's gonna cost more
but uh the off the shelf is gonna be uh cheaper and it's gonna be allow us to produce it quicker and get out there faster
but it's going to be less flexible with the features especially things like uh voice activation
which haven't really been used much on remotes so there's not really chips out there that would be easy to uh to convert
so if we were uh definitely gonna go with the the voice option we'd probably have to design um our own chip
and that pretty much sums it up
okay so how um sorry can you uh just put that one back up again please
mm
oh yep sorry
yep
um
uh d d d okay i mean uh inevitably a b a custom design chip is gonna be more expensive
mm
do we do we know uh by how much
um i don't actually have any price information no
and and do we know how long it'll take to uh develop a a custom chip
um it a lot longer than an off the shelf chip
oh w yeah we did the the problem is the the the voice technology is not really highly developed
right okay
it's sort of still still in an ex experimental form
uh so it would uh it's hard to predict the time
right i think we need to make a a decision here
uh given that the company wants this on the market quickly and cheaply
mm
that would appear to uh effectively constrain us to an existing chip and thus therefore conventional button technology
um uh now before we go round everybody else does anybody um
i
h have any have anyti ha anything to say about that
i just have a question about that
um does it make a difference if there are just a few commands
for example if you um can pre programme in like numbers one through ten and pre programme say you know
nine channels and then just use the voice recognition to say channel one and then you've programmed in say b. b. c. four as your channel one
as your favourite it's like to have a certain number of favourites um and that w
w just to to incorporate the voice activation in it is is sorta the trick
once you've got the whole voice chip in there then it's pretty much the the world the the sky is your limit
okay
then it doesn't matter
okay
but to actually the the big step is to actually get the voice activation chips in there and working
okay
cause uh i must say i find it slightly surprising given that you know mobile phones incorporate voice activated dialling
so uh um i mean i d d for slightly different well no i mean it's if you you
yeah
speak somebody's name and it'll dial the number for you
so uh bu i mean the this this information is from is this is the internal company information is it
uh bits of it yeah
so uh
of course mobile phones do tend to be more expensive you know hundred and fifty pounds or something
yes as well
as opposed to the twenty euros twenty five euros
yeah mm true again but if it's without any without any uh p price informations that's uh difficult to uh
uh decide
also lots of mobile phones have got a lot of technology in them not just that so
yeah
mm
yeah that's that's right
it's like it's it's you can't 'cause mobile phones are expensive you can't say it's the voice recognition bit that is
yeah
but we don't know
um
i mean uh
i su i i mean if given that the um the technology is not well developed and and given that it's it's never been done before
um th th the double risk
uh perhaps we ought to uh stick to uh to buttons since the last thing we want to do is present a product that doesn't work
um
thoughts
well another thought i oh sorry go ahead
would
oh i was just gonna say mayb maybe it sh
like um
maybe we can like cut corners somewhere else to bring in over cost
i mean do w do we think that the voice technology is fundamental to the project
uh it's fundament well i mean i guess it it's something we've discussed uh since the the sort of the beginning
so i th i think in in our in our minds it's it's fundamental
but i don't know that the uh the upper echelons of the company would necessarily agree with that so i think you have to
i mean i think we
oh yeah
mm
hm
okay
well i kinda think if we're gonna have the voice recognition for part of it then maybe we should have it for the whole thing
yeah i i i i i think that's uh
mm
and we've been talking about it the whole time
mm mm
yeah yeah
anyway i'm i'm incli kinda inclined to say that we should just go for it
mm right okay
mm
uh yeah it's the second most important aspect to users that the device should be technologically innovative
yeah
from uh my presentation show so
yeah it should be
uh technologically innovative
right okay so
no that sounds good
fine
okay
mm
i it will have voice recognition um uh if if that means uh if that means we can't afford buttons but i mean b b second question
mm
okay
cool
do we need the five buttons for channel change up down volume up down and on off
just as a a backup or just so that people can uh j j just sit there pressing buttons
um
yeah
yeah i i would say we do yeah
i think so
right
okay
sorry d did you want to say anything
uh nope that was it that was it
no
okay
shall we move rapidly on to uh kendra
okay
okay
uh um ra rapidly move the cable over
let's see
mm
oh good
oh
yes
is it gonna work
yeah it's thinking about it
mm yeah it'll get there
yep
okay
yeah
okay so i did some research on the internet and um what you know the interf user interface are just aspects that are seen by users
um commands and mechanisms for the operation and there're just kind of a variety of choices
um findings
so a lot of times they tend to look cluttered and these were just a couple examples of um different kinds that are a little bit more unusual
mm-hmm
there're some special ones available like this one right here which is marketed towards children
mm yeah
uh-huh
um different designs and one of the things that n we need to watch out for is a v. in volume because people some
alright
bring a little picture of what i thought ours could look like
so just kind of minimise the clutter
mm-hmm
avoid too many buttons and also um one of the things that people have used is a slide button like you have on a mouse
that possibly we could use that on the sides for volume for example have the slide button on the side
mm
and then you can pre programme the channels the voice recognition and then the voice response sample locator
mm yeah
sorry y y yeah if i can interrupt you
well d p 'kay do you wanna say anything about um slide controls
mm
i mean i think the reason everybody uses pushbuttons is that they're they're si simple cheap and reliable
uh
uh i think they're they're about the same cost really
i i mean i think it's just sort of the the there's a lot of slide buttons out there
i think it's pretty much the same sort of connection
okay fair enough fine
mm yeah
just because i n for example if i'm using a mouse i like to be able to slide it up and down so i thought it might be good for volume to just be able to kind of roll it and then have the up and down and then the this is my great little drawing
mm
yeah
good good
yeah
so three three there's three buttons on a slider
three buttons channel up channel up down and
y yes yes
well if you g if you if you got a channel up down we can have a slider in that as well
because if it if you no if you notice on the thing it it kind of like has got kind of if you you know it s kind of like sticks
if you know what i mean up like one unit if you see what i mean
yeah
mm
so it kinda goes up one then y like you can keep rolling it up but it's like like like like a cog or something
uh-huh
so you kinda take it up one at a time
okay
the only advantage i was thinking of to having the buttons like the buttons on one side for the channel
d
um
mm-hmm
and then the slider is that if you're just holding in your hand and you pick it up
it's easy to n s know okay this is just the volume and this is the channel
oh
this one on the one side and one yeah
uh you could you could as l as like a mouse you could
ye yeah 'cause i've definitely picked up remotes and like meant to change the channel and turn the volume
okay
yeah
or vice versa so it'd be kinda good to have them be feel completely different
yeah
yeah
you'd know what you were fiddling with
yeah
yeah like the shape of it almost like a mouse with a
yeah
that was
or yeah uh th th the i mean thi this is what the we have to come up with is the the actual shape that people can ins instantly pick it up and and know know uh know what it's going to do
mm
yeah
okay so we we're looking at sliders for both a uh volume and channel change
um well i was thinking kind of just for the volume but what what do you guys think
of one sort
just for the volume uh
mm
dep
i dunno if it depending on the final shape of it 'cause you could have like
we could
i dunno it looks like you can c control the volume with your thumb and then you could control the buttons with your fingers
yeah yeah
yeah 'cause if yeah in that kinda position the fingers would be better for pressing and the that for rolling just the way it would
fingers yeah
i mean it's it's
it yeah i mean it it it seems to me that uh it uh it al also has the advantage that it it the two are clearly different
b
yeah
mm yeah yeah yeah
yeah
um that there's no no possibility of uh confusing the two
oh yeah yeah
so okay
i'm just gonna pass this along
right so uh that's sorry is that that all you want to say at the mo okay fine
yes
yeah
mm right
here we go
right
uh yeah this is my report on trend watching
mm-hmm
the data's come off internet uh from executive summary for us on the top three things wanted by the consumer
and we got reports from paris milan on new fashions
and uh
the most important aspect is the l the look it has to look fancy look and feel
mm-hmm
uh instead of the current functional look and feel
this is a st well i was gonna say yeah twice as important as the second aspect which is the technologically innov innovative um side of it
mm
so uh and the third being easy to use is probably a given we have to try and incorporate so uh
well i i mean i th i think that what we're suggesting ought to address all three of those
uh exactly yeah
yeah
mm
okay
i s that out of sequence
uh yeah sorry
uh yeah and uh from the fashion watchers from milan and paris have said fruit and vegetables are an important theme for clothes and furniture and shoes
oh
et cetera
uh sorry clothes shoes and furniture
uh-huh
and uh
a spongy material to be used on the on the outside
mm i hadn't thought of that that's different certainly
yeah
mm
but uh i was gonna say um yeah fruit and vegetables uh important to this year um important to furniture i'm just gonna say
what
uh f like it's in if if fashion if we're going for the it looks fancy then fashion is obviously the line we gotta be going through
yeah
mm-hmm
but fashions do don't last very long
well that can kinda tie into our changing uh face things
like we could have the fruit and vegetable theme this year and uh whatever happens next year we can have the face plates yeah
mm
yeah
yeah
yeah we can have a sp like a spongy skin on it and then we can just whip that off and
yeah yeah
uh
yeah like the kind you get on like hand weights
you know that kind of spongy yeah
mm yeah that weird i dunno what that is but yeah
uh
a kind of yeah
mm
also means you can drop it without damaging it
oh
yeah
uh yeah it's good as well
that's c cool
yeah that's true
mm-hmm
um you have we could
if we could save depending on the cost of the product itself you know
could we have uh a cheaper b cheaper power source and then just have it annually renewed
instead of having a ten year guarantee
with interchangeable covers could just buy a new one every year a new one when new fashions come out
yeah
mm
i i mean it its uh i that's an interesting idea it's like the old swatch watch where uh um on only batteries ever got changed in those
'cause people just bought a new one when it went out of fashion but it's just never been seen as a a fashion item before
mm
yeah
um that's yes if if if they're made in sufficient quantity
wh
i
i think it's easier sometimes to have them buy changeable covers for it than to buy a whole new one
because you don't feel like you're investing in a whole new product
w i mean we we can uh uh b but i mean my feeling is that current power sources are such that for relatively little cost you can make it last
yeah
mm
you know a long time
yeah
um but if we also make it cheap enough that people either change the cover every year or even buy a new one every year then it it's it's even better
mm
mm
what if we included the batteries in the cover
mm-hmm
oh yeah
so um like
i like that
that all c also kind of encourages 'em to buy new covers and yeah
yeah so can i see that thing
um
s
just this as examples
yeah yeah
i n i know the only p i mean the the the the immediate thing that comes to mind with that is that it it it y you've then got the connection and you've immediately got a sort of unreliability
so f
whereas the advantage of having it plumbed in is that that the whole thing is all you know
uh yeah
completely soldered together and it it it you know total reliability but i mean i d i i uh
yeah i guess that's
mm
true
i know what you're saying and uh understand where you're coming from
or well but like uh like more than just the battery like a complete different like you've only got like
you know like th uh this bit's the bit you keep and this is the expensive bit this is like the chip and this is the microphone
mm-hmm
and then this is the power source and the bit everyone sees
and then
i th i s i think if we're gonna go down that route then we're talking about uh even if it costs slightly more than that
um just building the whole thing in one then having getting cheaper production costs um and
yeah you probably are right
you know giving people the option of buying a new uh a a complete new thing
the advantage of a replaceable cover is that even if they don't it doesn't have a cover on at all it will still work um totally
mm
yeah that's true
mm
um then if you know if people lose the cover
yeah yeah
i mean they they might be well inclined to go out and spend however many euros on a on a new one um rather than a a complete new re remote
yeah
well that that's just it with the covers
yeah
you're sort of tricking 'em into continuing to spend their money on our products without making 'em feel like they're being ripped off having to buy a new product
yeah i mean it is it's up to it's up to
yeah just another five euro to get
so yeah
yeah
yeah it's it's up to our marketing people to to ma to ma turn it into a a fashion item
mm
right
mm yeah
um and you know as as external fashions change then we get new new covers on the market and you know readily available
mm
yeah
and um
and that's the sort of thing once you get the mould set you can just whip out different colours different pictures very very quickly
that's that's right yeah yeah
yeah like they have for mobile phones that are just fruits and animal prints and colours
yeah yeah exactly exactly
yeah
yeah okay
so uh i so uh okay
um right sorry
um we hadn't finished your
um oh don't worry it's all said i was just gonna say uh yeah
are we gonna make this as part of like like uh a part of the f like it it the fashions apply to furniture
so are we gonna make this part of the furniture
it's the sort of thing that we want people to have prominent dis displayed on their um coffee table to say this says something about me
mm
mm-hmm
um this is fashionable
yeah
this is fashionable with
yeah
i you know i'm i'm i'm with it i'm up to date
and you know th the the design that i've got and and it could be a a home made design
um you know this says this is not just a a television remote control this is you know a fashion accessory
um
so i mean the the the basic shape i is is what we uh i mean given that we've got you know one one on off button presumably
mm
two buttons for uh channel change and one slider and basically nothing else um w we need to decide on the just the basic shape of the thing
and know whether we go down the fruit and veg route and i don't suggest we make it look like a banana
but um know sort of the the organic
you know curved look you know t to deliberately get away from the uh um uh you know
mm
oh yeah
the the the the square look of most um current uh remotes and
you know whether whether the you know the the fixed part of it is the corporate yellow
um
mm or uh 'cause there's certainly you know the the corporate logo needs to be prominently uh displayed so that people s th looked at it and say right
that's a real reaction remote control i want one of those
i dunno that we should make the whole thing yellow i kinda thought with a you'd have like a yellow circle with the r. r. in it somewhere on it
yeah uh the the uh or or b
yeah like an
but i'd yellow seems a bit of a strong colour to make the ent like the thing no
yeah i'd i'd um yeah
yeah
but i mean just like white or grey or black or some sort of blah colour
uh no i d i i agree i mean we're we're we're simply it's simply required to incorporate the the the the corporate logo prominently um
yeah yeah
yeah
yeah
mm
and make that a fashion symbol as well
well n
well th this is this is the whole point yes you know
i'm i've got a a real reaction uh remote control to go with my real reaction coffee maker or or whatever
and uh then people you know people demand more real reaction stuff
mm-hmm
well i was sort of mm kinda picturing like maybe um a shape that's almost like a mouse
mm
yeah
so that you know
yeah
when they hold it it's because a mouse is pretty comfortable to hold in your hand um maybe we could make it a slightly different shape so they could hold on to it
but that way they can have the volume on the side and then the channel buttons and
yeah
mm
yeah
have the power wherever somewhere
yeah
i mean that was just an idea that i had
i mean i've uh yeah
oh no that well there's the sim my my idea was something a b probably you know a bit fatter than this but sort of tha that sorta shape so that you can just sort of ho hold it
yeah
yeah maybe
yeah you'd want it narrower than a mouse though 'cause it a mouse you're kinda just resting on it you want something you can definitely grip
kind of a c
w it i mean well it's sort of it's it's sort of uh a a mouse but held
so maybe it'd be
yeah
sort of a combination
yeah yeah
yeah
you know so it's you sorta hold it in your hand like that i with you know and fiddling with the buttons
yeah
yeah and fiddle around with it and press it
yeah so yeah kind of maybe maybe a little wider than this 'cause this is pretty comfortable to hold and then if you had
maybe almost like a hairbrush
like you could get the about the width of that end of the pen and then it widens up top and you can fiddle an yeah
yeah then wider up here
and then it would have a l uh wider thing to uh have the light
yeah yeah
the infrared light at the t. v. and just kinda change channels and adjust the volume and the power could be wherever up up the top or something
yeah
mm
yeah cool
what do you guys think about that
yeah that sounds
okay yeah yeah
um i'm just i'm suddenly realising that yeah we're discussing how much how good it's gonna be to change channels t we still can just tell it to
i mean are we are we starting to get away from the the voice functionality of it
oh yeah
yeah
it's a very good point
it is a very good point
yeah
i think we d i think we decided that w we're actually going down both routes
yeah yeah
yeah
that um the we n we need the the manual controls and that they should be of that form but that uh yeah
yeah
but do you know this shape also kind of les lend itself to to voice 'cause if you're you're holding it and you're fiddling
but you can also bring it up like that and it's microphone esque yeah yeah
then you just bring it up to your mouth and just speak to it yeah yeah
yeah and just say
yeah maybe we cou like w like we're leaving out the buttons for the the f less frequently used stuff
but maybe we could incorporate that into the voice
mm
i th i th honest uh my personal view is that if it's not there people wouldn't use it anyway um
mm i suppose but t there is the off chance that you know th the brightness is wrong on your t. v. or the contrast needs changing
it's cer it's certainly possible i mean
but they we we're going beyond w w given the state of the technology we want something that we kno we know will will work um
bu
mm
hmm yeah
well you can still i incorporate the voice with with less buttons
i mean uh if the power button was also somehow like a menu button you could press that and or do voice commands
and either volume thing could also be to scroll through other options like y and you could scroll through brightness and and sc and then you can you can minimise the buttons and still have those
uh
yeah that's a good idea
yeah i suppose i sup
yeah
you know brightness and tint and stuff
yeah
if we we're i mean i'm getting a clear message that we think that we should have those facilities available
so i guess we could have a menu button as well
yeah
we could have the channels and the power and then a menu button and then the volume
yeah
so have four buttons and the volume instead of three buttons and the volume
uh uh uh
okay if we if we're going down that route then
we need some sort of display
do we need some sort of display
but the television would be the display that things like that usually c pop up on a televi like you hit menu and menu will come up on television and have like tint brightness
yeah that's on the t. v. yeah
we actually use the television okay
yeah and then y
okay okay okay
and you'd use the scroll scroll through it yeah
well i mean on a onto like a mouse the ru the scrolling button
yep
is actually a button as well you could press it you could press that and have it as a menu button
yeah yeah that's true
yeah press that is t yeah that might work
i never understood how that worked though but yeah
yeah it's like um yeah it's like the mouse where you just kinda click it
yeah mm
you just press it
yeah and you could just click that to so if you had like the menu then you could scroll through and then click it to select
mm oka yeah
yeah
uh yeah
you know what i mean
mm yeah
okay we got five minutes to go in this meeting
okay
so um i d i think we've actually very conveniently just uh come to uh a good point to s to sum up um
cool
so um b b kate and kendra now go away and uh pa play play with a bit of plasticine or play dough
play with play dough
whatever it is on the other side of the atlantic
hmm
um and actually put what we've discussed into something uh i was gonna say concrete
but that's a slightly inappropriate word um to something that we can we can see and um andrew n can go away and th th think about how we can uh actually market this as a concept and not j not just a uh um a a simple remote control
uh can i just get some things clear just for my sake
yeah certainly of course
our energy source is gonna be
i think i think we decided that we're gonna for for simplicity of you know
long term
manufacturing and uh maintenance that we will go for a a long term battery source um
mm
cool
uh
i you know on the basis that um that you know if we're going for making it a fashion statement
then uh people are more likely to change it anyway uh before i it runs out and um make an assumption that we we can aim for a battery that will last most people for uh we'll say at least five five ten years and that we'll w we will guarantee it for for five years um
yeah
and we're having a custom chip
we're having a
a custom chip but given the the we've cut the functions down um that will hopefully not be too problematic
but given that um technol technological innovation is important then we need to i'll say it again technologically innovate
um and uh we we know we must resist any efforts to uh to try and water that down um
and interchangeable case
i i interchangeable case seems to be um um important to the concept
mm
um it it should be cheap you know if if we avoid any you know electrical connections
yeah
mm
and uh i you know i if we can come up with some way of of allowing people to actually personalise it uh to whatever they want
mm mm-hmm
then uh i mean uh uh this is totally new
we d we don't know whether
that to what extent people do it or not but if they've at least got a a good selection of um covers that they can use anyway
and uh and if if we can keep them you know rolling then uh you know
so they can get them in the supermarket when they go down to um a any of the famous supermarkets i won't mention any mention any names
um it's uh it's good for the supermarket and it's good for us and it hopefully makes them feel better
and uh are we gonna have it il being illuminated from inside onto the buttons or
um the that i mean that's no because we've got so few buttons that it that actually makes that redundant
yeah i think so too
mm does actually yeah yeah
cool
yeah and especially for making them so like different and
mm different to feel yeah yeah
yeah yeah
yeah
and the you know that that solves one of the problems of b of battery life
mm-hmm
'cause that would well that would clobber the battery life so no
yeah
yep yeah
mm-hmm
i mean given the nature of the buttons we're having it's actually uh uh unnecessary i think
yeah
yeah
mm-hmm
are we having it that it's any angle or is it just
as uh as wide cer certainly wider angle than than current so that if you're holding it you know
yeah
as wide as possible
anyway like you're likely to and uh it's uh you know i i it will work most of the time um
like this or like this
mm yeah
not like my my mum who points it at the ceiling and wonders why the th th the television doesn't work
um yeah i mean i d i th i sorta envisaged that if if this was the the thing
then sort of the the whole of the top would be the uh the infrared uh
yeah kinda like this whole
mm-hmm
yeah mm
so you could use like this and it would go
um so
mm
yeah 'cause i mean the r reality is people are they're gonna be looking at the television whilst they're using it
the chances are so if if they're holding it anyway
yeah
the they're reasonably likely to be holding it to use it then uh then that that's the sort of coverage that we want
yeah
um okay d we're all clear where we go from here
yep
yep sounds good
mm-hmm
okay so thank you very much indeed and i'll s see you all again in thirty minutes
'kay
okay
'kay
right well
welcome to the what should be the last of these meetings and uh it looks like we've uh done a good job here and uh
we'll just go through the the final uh the final details
um okay oh the um
th the the minutes of the last meeting uh i think we'll take those as read um
okay the um th the the next uh thing we we we'll have a look at the uh th have a look at the prototypes and uh look at the uh evaluation criteria and finance and then uh
uh just tidy up with production and um and then we can close
um
so f if if you'd like to uh present your your proposals
uh okay we basically have the same kinda lay out here it's just um you hold it like this and it gets kinda moulded to the to the shape of your hand
basically
um on the left we've got the scroll for the volume
on the right we have buttons for the channels up and down and that kinda so you can hold it and scroll
or you can hold it and and push
uh this is the power key um it's kinda like the biggest so you know how to turn on
uh-huh
uh that's the little menu key
this is the infra red section so you g it'll be sending rays and if you're you know pointing it like that it can send it
yep yeah good good
or if you hold it up like that it'll send it
uh we got a microphone there which for all the voice commands so you can you know talk to it like that and it'll still understand
uh-huh
yep right
um the logo is down down there um and has the cover on it and you can see like it just kinda goes the red bit's the cover and it kinda goes over everything and then there's holes for the buttons to come through
uh-huh
mm
s
yep yep mm-hmm
um
and so we figured it would be kind of you know a light weight plastic
just kind of a light non descript grey so that people'll wanna buy the covers and then the covers will be that sort of rubbery material like they make ipod covers
mm
uh-huh
yep yep
yep
so they kinda just stretch over
showing me age i don't know what i c ipod covers are like
mm
yeah
well i i didn't know that but yeah they're kind of it's just kind of a rubbery and that way you know spongy like is something that people wanted and it just sort of stretches over and that way i think probably helps protect it a little bit too as well and
yeah yeah
uh-huh
yeah
okay yep right
mm-hmm
but it's also e e easier to put on versus like mobile covers you actually have to screw them on and stuff and you kinda sometimes have to get someone to do that for you
okay
this is very much you should be able to stretch it over yourself and it'll be fine
yep
just kinda stretch it over
okay good yeah
and it'll just stay on and then the buttons come through and so and then the each one of 'em on the very end will have the logo with the yellow circle and the r. r.
yeah
yeah
yep right
li that'll be the covers as well yeah yeah
yeah
yeah yeah
i mean tha it's it's a detailed point i just wondered i mean h how will people put these down i wonder
like that
right
okay for some strange re reason i had it in my mind that they'd put them down vertically but uh uh
yeah it could stand yeah
oh
well we could broaden the broaden it out a bit so it would stand like that
yeah
uh no because particularly if they've dif if they're gonna have it as a you know as a fashion item uh i mean it it's uh it it's just i mean it's just a minor detailed point
yeah standing
but um as you say you can just make the base a little bit bigger and uh
yeah we could just widen it out uh
yeah and uh it just needs another uh another logo somewhere is is is is all it gives gives people the option and if if say if they've got them um because actually have several upon the uh
mm
mm
could have one for your stereo one for your d. v. player
mm yeah yeah
yeah well
yeah
have to if we just lengthen it i guess so it comes down to the base of the hand and then flatten it out and could sit there
yeah but that that's uh but uh no the the the overall uh the overall concept is uh yeah yeah no no i mean that's these uh
yeah just kind of
or just make it little
yeah mm
somewhere like that
yeah
yeah
so it just sort of
we might have to lengthen it so it kinda your hand still holds it and have it there yeah yeah yeah like that like that
yeah i kinda had a
a kinda a natural kind of a idea where it's like more of a kind of like a kinda maybe slightly like thinner
yeah
yeah
bu
yeah kinda like that kinda like a flower or a plant for the more natural kinda
yeah
but uh yeah but no th but the yeah the the the
mm
the final product would actually stand up yeah
yeah yeah yeah i mean it it's uh wouldn't wouldn't do that indeed yeah
fall over
yeah
but th th but th yeah th b the these were all minor minor uh minor details
yeah yeah
yeah
i think the uh the basic concept i i is is absolutely bang on and the i it certainly meets our criteria of being uh of you know looking different
yeah
's a little longer
wee
mm
yeah
um so good that's that that's excellent
um right let us um
what's on the next one
oh right yes let's have a look at the um
f finance
um now
we're given a a clear design brief uh
if i get the uh spreadsheet up
oh
uh yeah just click there
uh the
the maximise button
oh right
ah
good this is why we need to make these things simple so that the uh the the the boss can understand
now i've um this is the company's uh uh costing for for various uh uh aspects of design and i i i've treated some of these slightly uh liberally given the constraints placed on us
um i wouldn't know for in for instance if if they require us to have it in the corporate colours
then that is not a special colour that's a that's a standard colour
uh so we're just simply on batteries the the one th the one decision i've had to make is that um
we're we will have to find a s a regular standard chip to to do this with and i i um i'm i'm i'm certain that they they are around so
um that i don't think is a a serious problem
the uh the the voice sensor is is expensive but we we made a a basic decision that that was absolutely fundamental to the to the design so that that has to stay
um then again the the the the shape of the case means that it's it's expensive to uh um
l to make 'cause of the the th the double curves but on the other hand because of our overall fashion concept um we we should exceed the the sales targets
um it's simply made of plastic so th that's uh that's no problem and uh um just because the whole the colour of the the whole thing that's uh uh there's some cost there
um and uh
we haven't actually got a scroll wheel we we we got push buttons and and a simple uh um
slider so um and the and the the buttons are uh uh well i do don't know that they're special colour
anyway the the costings uh come in at exactly on target at twelve point five uh but i thi i think we have a a very strong case to argue that uh what what we've got is is so in innovative and uh and different that um any any slight compromise we have to make on on cost is is offset by the uh you know the
uh you know the the the the concept of it being a a fashion accessory and and having the the interchangeable covers so uh um you know the if if if the management expect us to be techno again fail again technologically innovative um that they they have to accept that we we can't operate absolutely within uh the constraints that they give
mm
mm
so uh we we we present this as the uh the company's uh the the company's way forward and uh uh i i think we can argue that we we have uh come in on on budget
um
okay uh
so um
does anybody want to uh uh andrew do you want what do you want to say about um
the uh yeah the evaluation where where you know well where where we're where where we're at
evaluation
the the product or the project
the the the well the i meant the product
um well well my presentation just now
yeah
sure uh can i get the
oh sorry yeah um mm
cheers
mm
more loud clicks in the microphone
there we go oh
method of evaluation testing the product was to just if it met all the criteria all the conditions that we set out to
set out to solve from the point of view of the the consumer and the management
so
what i've been asked to do is on the whiteboard
um gauge
our team response to these questions
so on a scale of one to seven one being true and seven being being false
seven being a nice round number to work to
yeah
and then at the end just take an average
tr
on for true and seven for flase
yes
yes
so uh
so look at these questions
is the device f flashy and fashionable
well i think most definitely
yeah i'd say definitely a one yeah
i think it is yeah
so uh and also uh technologically innovative
yes the voice technology indeed
yeah defi yeah yeah
yeah
easy to use
i don't see we could've made it any easier
yeah
yeah
uh suitable for the consumer
that was um
totally
yeah definitely
yeah i think it made we met all of the consumer
yeah
yeah
wants
uh is it complicated
no
no
doing pretty well so far aren't we
uh functional
yeah
yeah definitely
yeah
um
where are we
found easily
we've b built in the the speech where are you function
yeah i mean that's that's
yeah
yeah
yeah mm-hmm
yeah
yeah
uh-huh
does it take long to learn to use
shouldn't
no not at all
mm-hmm
and uh what else
the r. s. i. compares to the current standards well
less buttons so it must be
uh
we we uh yeah it was our it was a we made an actual effort to
yeah it is sorta the the handle more ergonomically correct as well
yeah
yeah
so yeah um um
um will device appeal to all age groups
i think it will because i mean uh old older people who can't manage the buttons anyway will actually probably like the like like the voice bit so
mm
i think so
yeah uh that's a good call yeah
mm
well we had the we had the data saying that old people will be less likely to pay extra money but the funct the increased functionality
the e ease of use of the device might make up for that
mm
and it's it's it's well i don't think we're actually
charging a particular premium anyway in the end so
i i i think it will tend to appeal more to younger aged groups just 'cause we have gone with the fashion focus and the younger people tend to would be more conscious of that aspect of it
mm
yeah
yeah
yeah
but um i think it should still appeal on a certain level to everybody yeah
it will appeal f for dif for different reasons but it's it's uh yeah yeah so i i yeah i
yeah i think just the simplicity of it and
yeah yeah
yeah yeah
not having to learn to programme and not having you know a million buttons
yeah
yeah so i think we can reasonably say it's another another one why not
mm
uh can you just click the my mouse to move onto next page
uh yeah and what h did we make the management's
in in in in my interpretation of management's instructions uh is that yes it it meets the requirement is t it's television only it's it's simple to use
yep
mm-hmm
um it's it's it's within budget um i it's uh yes an an any minor points we we we argue
under the cost
mm-hmm
yep
um
so uh i i think we've done an amazing job in uh
yep
okay
well done us
coming up with what
so uh one two three four five six seven eight nine ten eleven
eleven divided by eleven's one so equals average of one
yeah
need a need a calculator for that
and that roughly concludes my evaluation of the of the product
excellent
okay nick the cable back then
i mixed up the colours a little bit
oh no that's
i think i all wrong
ooh
right do um
either of you want to uh say anything
uh
mm
mm
before i uh
ps i don't think so
i mean i think we worked well together and looked really at what the consumers wanted and what we were trying to make and you know
no
yeah
yeah
seemed to discuss things pretty well and come to group consensus and
mm-hmm
well that's right i mean th this this slide here i mean the satisfaction with uh room for creativity
mm
i mean i think we've allowed ourselves uh as much creativity as the uh the the the product uh allows
yeah definitely
yeah
um i won't comment on leadership uh teamwork i think we've uh i think everybody's uh worked pretty well together
mm-hmm
um we've just about coped with the whiteboard and digital pens uh i think the results speak for itself and new ideas found um
mm
again gi no given relatively everyday product i think we've v very uh very effectively come up with a a new uh
yeah
yep
uh a new approach
um are the costs within budget
yes
is the project evaluated
we're we're all happy that it it meets all the criteria um
yep
thank you very much indeed i think that i think that's uh i think we can go f for an early bath
cool thank you
alright
yeah
so i call the meeting closed
okay
not sure how far ahead of schedule we were there
is this okay
uh yeah
fine now
oh it's not liking us it went that a way
computer adjusting
oh
uh
okay
so
right
you ready back there
uh okay
welcome everyone
um this is the kick off meeting for the day
um we're the new group uh to create a new remote control for real reaction
as you can see our agenda is to open up the meeting um become acquainted with each other
um have a little training on tools uh create a plan discuss things and and we only have twenty minut twenty five minutes total
okay
the new remote control is to be original trendy and user friendly
that steph is your part is the user friendliness
the originality um is gonna take all of us
um the trendiness we'll probably go look at for some marketing research information from you sarah
um and we'll get on with it
okay so we'll have a functional design individual work um with meeting and then conceptual design t and then detailed design
okay
right
everybody's supposed to try out the whiteboard
kate why don't you try it first if you can either bring your things with you i guess
uh yeah if i can pick up with all these bits and pieces hang on
and while you're doing that we'll try and figure out how to hook these things on as well 'cause we're all gonna have to be able to walk around
uh right so you want an animal and the characteristics of that animal
do you have to be able to recognise what animal it is
uh i do not think so i think it's just to try out the whiteboard
um
are we all gonna draw a cat
only animal i could thin i could draw
i know
ah
its a sort of bunny rabbit cat
you can tell it's not a bunny rabbit by the ears
uh-huh
um i suppose it should have a mouth as well sort of
okay
right yeah
great
and the characteristics
um the favourite characteristics of the cat um the whiskers i think um because they're the easiest to draw
uh-huh
in fact i'll give it some more
oh and the tail
okay
fantastic
since you're handy as well why don't you do yours next steph
i think it's to get us used to using the pen
yes
um sure it's not to test our artistic
uh no
it's a mouse
a mouse y
that's not a mouse y no
no it's not a mouse
it's a wombat
oh
it's a ratty
argh
a what
a ratty
rat
not a mouse a rat
a webbed foot
webbed f oh right
it's clothes
that's it's clothes
it's a ratty with a with a with a very long tail
and your favourite characteristics of that animal
i love whiskers
uh they're intelligent and they're cheeky and
uh fantastic pets and very friendly
oh
okay
and they sit on your shoulder and whisper the answers to your homework in your ear when you're doing your homework
kate
thanks
oh a fish
gosh why didn't i think of fish
a shark
that's even easier to draw than cat
mm this is very representational fish
oh okay
fine
um i like them because they're sleek and they have a lot of freedom but they also do n uh swim in groups so
favourite characteristics
'kay
so they have team elements
do you have a favourite one
i'm afraid i'm with steph
and i think your pen's running out of whatever
but i'm afraid i take the coward's way out and the cat's looking the other way
he's hiding
um cats are sometimes very independent
my parents had cats
uh and they can mm decide for themselves what is best
okay
now um we have to get down to the nitty gritty of how to make this and this remote control has to be sold um we're to sell it for twenty five euros
with a profit aim ultimately of fifty million euros
that tells you something about how many um we have to sell on an international scale
um would be an awful lot of these would be like what
a hundred million of them um to make twenty five euros on each one and to make a total profit of fifty million
um the production is to only cost twelve and a half euros per item
now if they cost twelve and a half you're selling it for twenty five you're making twelve and a half euros each
um and we're to make a profit of fifty million that's t uh can you do the maths and how many are we selling
uh yeah
i was just wondering if that's the um
if fifty percent is normal
mark up
b yeah
um i would think would be more like sixty percent
but um let me i have two thoughts
okay
one hundred fifty percent
and and your question is how many do we have to sell
yes 'cause our market um is international and your problem is has to do with marketing of you know
you gotta know how many we're going to be selling to know how big a market you have to target and who is that
at twenty five
mm-hmm
yeah that's um
to give you a pretty good idea of where you're looking
so that's four million of them
something like that
okay
yeah
that's fifty million euros
in order to make fifty million euros and you're only getting twelve and a half each
and if we make
mm-hmm
that's a lot of selling
yeah
two four
four million
to be fifty be four million
you'd have to sell four million
hmm
okay
right
experience with a remote control
any of you use of remote control for a television or d. v. d. or something
that that that's the sorta product we're talking about one that will work for a in a home environment for a t. v. s and
you're both nodding all three
yeah
well
i've seen some remote controls that are for more than one device at a time
but i also have heard about them not working well or not well co ordinated and you wind up working with this one for thi this three and then this one over here for another
it is true that you always sit around you know you're sitting on your sofa and you wanna change something there's five different remotes
and one for the d. v. d. and one for the video and one for cable and one for whatever else
mm-hmm
y yeah
and they don't always talk to each other
but i presume this is t i presume this is just for television
don't know
okay
are there any um ideas for the remote
what would it be for and what group would be be for
we have to think about that one
we could make a hello kitty
themed remote
i think one in b bright colours would be good
yeah
i think one that works would be good
we could totally go for the japan a mation
well i mean there's also the cachet that um uh the japanese make great products
electrical their industrial design is very good
i think one that doesn't have lots of superfluous functions
like i've got one at home that has
well apart from the obvious channels channel up channel down volume
yeah
you know subtitles mute there's a lotta buttons that i've got no idea what they do like
well that's a really good point because i think one of the things that being somewhat computer literate
okay
we tend to um go to menus and then make choices you know
so if it's like an uh volume button you know you can go in and say mute or or volume
we don't need to have like the l the numbers if we also have uh uh channel up channel down
mm
mm
okay
mm
we can make it smart like an ipod you know make everything menus
ooh closing the meeting
yeah
um i know this sounds like it was very quick but the
that was quick
i think that's the industrial design is the first one that's kate for the working design
mm
mm-hmm
and user that's you s steph for the technical functions design and for marketing the user requirements specification
i think there's going to be a lot of we have to help each other and work through this as a group
and i think we all you know
we like our kitty cat and our rat and our fish but i think we all have to like each other um to get this done
uh as it says we're gonna get individual instructions but uh i don't think they allowed a lot of extra time
so i think a little bit of less of this and more at do will set us in good stead
do you all agree
mm-hmm
mm-hmm
alright
um then i don't see any reason to prolong it and f we should finish this meeting at ni right now and go into other things
alright so this is the end of the first meeting
okay
'kay
thank you all
uh it fell off
one two three four yeah we're ready
okay
welcome to this second meeting
um it's now quarter after twelve and we're given forty minutes um for this meeting
this is a meeting on functional design
um and i wanna welcome you all and thank you all for doing some research in between
um i did took the minutes from the first meeting and i'll show them to you in a moment
um i know each of you have a presentation and um in thinking about the forty minutes
i thought it would take only like three minutes for the previous minutes um each of you having about seven minutes or maybe a little more
maybe a little less for your pre presentations and a little discussion
because there's i happen to have been told there were some new project requirements and we have to make some uh decision on what functions it will have
okay
is this ap everybody agree with this
yes
oops
yes
okay
um and after the meeting there'll be things to be done and as you can see it says we get to get lunch
um and then some more individual work and then putting minutes away and individual actions
um but uh now for the minutes of the first meeting
and go to that one
um as you can see it was this earlier today
um kate steph sarah and myself in our four capacities were present
i opened the meeting the product was developed uh and reviewed and we talked about the financial end of it
um and it had some implications um the four million sales target and new ideas of not too many buttons
bright colours and some of the influence of the japanese
and we closed early so you could then proceed with your research and getting your reports together for tod this meeting
anybody have any questions on those minutes
are they complete did they discuss everything that we covered last time
'kay
uh i think so we we we talked about the the individual roles that we each had as well
did i miss something
mm-hmm
yeah
i'm afraid i incorporated that when i said who was present but yes we did
okay
and we did a little bit of uh team building of uh of making the pictures but i didn't think those were appropriate to the minutes necessarily
so um as a group i think we've are they're accepting the minutes
okay i accept the minutes
and uh okay
is that what we're supposed to say
yeah
yeah i do
good
um then we'll move to the three presentations
okay
okay
okay
mm we need to move this
who wants to go f first
that's as far as it goes
uh not really meant to touch those microphones
oh it doesn't have any on does it
that's fine
excellent thank you
oy big loop under the table
she said we didn't need to screw it in
okay
okay that looks good
it's doing its thing
there we are
alright
thank you very much
um
one of the the biggest issues i found about um from last meeting was the fact that we need to sell four million of these um
remote controls and i think that this is an opportunity to really take real reaction in the direction of of similar
of handheld tools that have been used and are used by many of us and to kind of bring the remote control into the si same realm as an accessible um useful electronic device
as opposed to something that is lost in the couch and what have you
so um my main goal here is to re envision the remote control in in this context and to think about menu functionality and current technology and the fact that it could be interactive with other tools
um some of the research uh in the market has shown that people really are not happy with remote controls as they are now
and um that means we do need to
make some decisions about what what keys or or buttons on the on the remote control to perhaps keep and and what ones to discard
and if we devote some energy into this i think the um recent productions of real reaction
the i go everywhere power and the high definition d. v. d. players although it makes immediate sense to have our remote control interact with these
i think we can also use this as a platform to make it interact with other tools
and um in fact i think the high definition d. v. d. players and all of this will come along in the uh will only benefit from the positive feedback
from our well designed tool
so again most uh users really dislike the current look and feel of remote controls
um fifty percent i think of all these uh numbers the most important is fifty percent of user say they only use ten percent of the buttons
and eighty percent of users and if we think about this there are a lot of uh television d. v. d.
stereo remote control users out there eighty percent would spend more money on a remote control that looks fancy
could can i ask where these figures come from is this market research we've
um it was market research and there were a hundred people in the room so eighty out of a hundred said they would spend more money
now in between as the project manager
mm-hmm
they sent me an email from the powers that be um that teletext is outdated um and the internet is coming in as important
mm-hmm
but that they want this remote control to only be for t. v. um with incorporating the corporate image colour and slogan
mm-hmm
well i think we can i i think we can really focus on this remote and and again bring the real reaction um brand in in and and get some positive marketing for our other tools
even if we directly don't um advertise for the i go everywhere line
mm
so an interesting um element was the would you pay more for speech recognition question
so these market research uh uh questionnaires looked into your your uh concern about technology and s specifically wanted to
hmm
find out information about speech recognition
okay
now
the early adopters those of us who grew up with technology and uh luck lucky for us have the uh cash to to pay for it
the young age group without the mortgages and responsibilities ninety one percent of them would pay more for speech recognition in a remote control
very interesting i i leave this up to the group to decide if we wanna use this uh if and you know
the the designers but ninety one percent fifteen to twenty five
mm
is that a large enough target market to target it
well i i i think especially in terms of growth i think this would be a very smart group to target
i mean s three quarters of the next age group twenty five to thirty five are interested
and uh with the technologies improving if we can get these uh
in real numbers does the ninety one percent and the seventy six percent translate to ex in excess of the four million
yeah
to
um yes
or eight million
yes
but would you pay more and does it work and is it approachable and and did i know that it was it was an that's a that's a very good question
hmm
yeah
i don't know if speech recognition should be um should be included but i think it's an interesting i think that maybe shows more about uh
um
mm
being open to technology
uh it definitely needs uh a lot more research on like how much more it would be and any
mm
shall i go back
yeah yeah
you know existing examples and what reactions to them have been and that sort of thing
yeah
how d i'm wondering how how ou how our target price compares with the the typical price of these things
i expect an industrial designer should know that
but if we're aiming to to build this thing for twelve euros fifty um is that a lot or a little
exactly
i mean i i i uh did not receive any information on that but i think the competition
sussing out what other people are doing and what's in the pipeline is very very important
because um there is a question about do you want an l. c. d. screen and and that wasn't responded to but uh some of the larger
remotes do have screens where you can navigate you know
so it turns into something uh perhaps you all have seen uh the osbournes where ozzy osbourne is is attempting to manage his super entertainment system with something that looks like a uh a small tray
sh surely he's in the wrong age group
you know it's i a and i think you know
he must be w one of a s small population
no no you kate you're exactly right there
mm
but i think the key is to get the early adopters people who are familiar with technology and and uh they'll be
but we're not looking at whether they're early adopters on that screen that's looking at age groups
uh mm
exactly
i yes
and i'm making and i'm making the the uh uh leap that people who are familiar younger people are l are more familiar with technology than than older people
leap
hmm
or comfortable you know um so
mm
okay you had the other power channel
i think the most important thing is an attractive streamlined remote control and to be extraordinarily reductionist power channel volume and everything else is is uh
up to the designers
and this is this is also supported by the market research
okay
thank you
that's my contribution
alright
and we'll turn to the next presentation
i think she said we don't need to screw it in just stick it in
and then press what
f f. n. and f. eight
next to the control button on the bottom and then f. eight at the top
yeah press them
and then w be patient
yeah here we go
tada
and if you want it to go into slide show mode it's that little button there
can i not just uh
do each one in order
i you can if you like it it that that just sets it up to do a p a p no that one that one there
there we are
that
yay
that
left left a bit left a bit that one yep
that
and then you just press the click when you wanna go on
right technical functions design
uh well i think first off basically i do agree with what sarah has defined as as uh your personal
i think we need uh a more streamlined volume with no extraneous functions
so my method was to look at the existing remotes and what functions they have
and what we all need to discuss is whether we want these functions
uh pretty much the same as what existing remotes have
if we can build on this with the speech recognition that's not something i'd thought about at all but it's also something we can discuss
okay
um and and i presume we can miss out the functions really to to a video or d. v. d. remote control
if this is only gonna be a you know satellite cable t. v.
t. v. only
remote control
so these are two models of existing remote controls
uh the one on the left
ugh
seems to be a fairly
uh standard universal remote control
it has fast forward stop play all relating to movies
it also has seems to have channel up and channel down which is which is more what you'd expect from a
you know like a sky or cable remote control where you've got hundreds of channels instead of a merely terrestrial one
hmm
uh but i think we should be looking more along the lines of the one on the right
which has it also has play stop and pause and everything i don't think we need them at all
i think we just need channel selection
volume up volume down and
i think an an enter function where you can access it's not like teletext but along the same lines access things on the screen
uh
not related to the internet one that you mentioned because that'd be far outside our budget and what we want this to do
mm
and exceed the requirements they're expecting of us
so it really exceed the requirements 'cause the requirements really are just want to be able to change channels and functions which
is more a text on the screen thing than uh than actual buttons o i was thinking something some smooth
okay
sleek little remote control with big user friendly buttons and uh a menu that you can access
alright
uh but then i do think we need to discuss the speech
um recognition possibility
okay
any uh thing else you wanna add
no
okay
but we could go back to the pictures of the
uh what're they called
the pictures of the remote controls
and possibly discuss what we think about them but maybe should hear what kate has to say first
or if
yeah
yeah
let's hear what kate has to say
okay then
maybe afterwards we could do a uh whiteboard with that your the one on the right as a as a
basis
hmm
whiteboard session
i think the white that one on the right is as well as less cluttered
mm-hmm
definitely less cluttered and i mean but still it's
sorry i was just i'll just uh resume something else i was gonna say
it's there but it's
the the style of these is terrible
yeah
i i i really think we need to uh
not only possibly even materials like the type of plastic used but everything including size and shape of buttons
positioning of buttons the actual shape of the hand held device colours
the ergonomics the way it fits in your
just every e yeah everything to do with this has to be revolutionised
hmm
yeah
but
so that's that for now
cheers
mm i haven't actually got a display on my screen
okay
still i'll do without that
okay um now i wanna bring us down to earth again i'm afraid and talk about the actual practicalities of how the thing needs to work
um oh and this is the methodology i used in preparing for this meeting
um basically i've been doing a little bit of web based research and if i had a design team i would've been discussing my ideas with 'em
but the the net result is that i've come up with a first cut for the working design that i'd like to discuss with you
so let's go back to what the basic function of a remote control is
it's for sending a message um typically um via infrared
and the the basic components we've got to build in for our twelve euros fifty are um an energy source the user interface and
which will um in incorporate um an integrated circuit that actually composes the message um based on what the which buttons the user presses
we turn that into a message um and then we need a sending mechanism to send it to the receiver
now i would have hoped i think that's my only slide actually yeah
i would have have hoped to um
do you a pretty powerpoint slide of um my first cut design
but unfortunately the technology defeated me so if you'll bear with me i'll do it on the whiteboard
so we want an energy source
which is there
and we've got to think about what that might be
uh we obviously don't want wires on this thing
hmm mm
uh typically it would be a battery but i'm open to suggestions
um and
then we have the the user interface
oops
and the main components in there are the
the th the chip that actually has the intelligence of the machine that translates button presses into a message which it then
transfers to some sending mechanism which encodes it
and sends the message to the receiver
so those are the basic things that we've got to get in for our twelve euros fifty
thank you
hmm
okay
right
but those things as long as we can get those components
the block that that rectangle for the user interface is where the user comes in of what what does it look like
what do the buttons look like
uh what does it feel like
that's where the user interface is really coming into its own
mm-hmm
the technical end is what's actually gonna be in there but also it has to be easy enough to change or repair if something goes wrong
for example the battery energy source or um what if the chip
for whatever reason breaks down after a certain amount of time do you just replace it
um is there any um because it may be in the same area with several other user interfaces like for d. v. d. s movies whatever
um does it have to have a
a way of being segregated from the others in a different frequency or something
well i may be wrong here but i'd been thinking of this device as being a a cheap mass produced device
we're trying to sell four million of 'em um that's that's you know that's almost one in every tenth household or whatever it is
mm
um and i hadn't thought of it as being a reparable thing
you just if it goes wrong you chuck it out and that's why i'm a bit concerned
okay
i like the idea of speech recognition that's a great idea
but i'm not convinced we can put it into this box for the price that we need gonna need to hit
do we have um
whoop
okay
ki some idea of how much it would cost to create a device that has these basic elements
isn't that your job
because then
oh
no the chip composer marketing
oh right
oh no the chip composer sender
mm
um
i i don't believe i know um
i'm i'm i'm hoping that my personal coach is gonna give me some advice on that if you're asking me but
what they cost
okay
okay
be because then we would ha ha figure out how much we had to play with in terms of user interface and this look and feel idea
yeah
yeah
mm
it does it does seem as if we're just to do something really simple and mass produced
mm-hmm
the which is pretty much the same as these existing models just maybe
inspired
a little bit more inspired
mm
but basically just the same
although what what uh suddenly came into my head is you know how they always take two a. a. batteries which which is really not very efficient at all
could it be possible to have uh you know like a rechargeable internal battery like well like an m. p. three player does
mm-hmm
with that you could jus or a mobile phone or whatever
mm-hmm
you could you know you just plug into a power source for a couple of hours and then it's recharged for ages and ages and ages
and you don't have to worry with replacing a. a. batteries which are
well that has another element which is if every time you're done using the remote you put it on a charger then you then it has a place
mm
you'd never need uh batteries would y uh yeah
yeah but it also has a place so exactly
and it's not stuck down the back of the sofa
mm
but then again i d i don't know if this is within our price range or not
that's a really good idea
well i uh think that's a very interesting idea but um i'm not a very good industrial designer and i don't know much about what these things cost
i'll do some research for the next meeting
well it's better than my idea about solar probably
okay
uh yeah
well solar may not be so good when you're watching t. v. in the night but
yeah yeah
mm
well it is just so annoying how
depen
it would have to sor store up the energy
mm
yeah
yeah i guess
and then use it
solar can do that
we may be talking quite heavy then
yeah
m yeah that would be too heavy and it'd cost too much
mm-hmm
no but just a rechargeable internal battery would probably i mean it might cost more to at first to develop and to install
mm-hmm
but for long term use it'll be so much more convenient and economic than fiddling around trying to replace chunky a. a. batteries and not having any in your kitchen drawer and
mm-hmm
so do you think we might make that a selling point if it was something that we found we could afford to develop
you know f
definitely 'cause i'm thinking in terms of um uh
mm
the
loss and breakage of um remotes how much of that is is to do with it not really having a uh a home
a um a nest a place to live exactly
mm
mm
sort of have its little dock that you could put it in
yeah
so if you can dock it um you know you could s argue that this is
and the dock could look very fancy and that could be your inspiration of having it looking decent
exactly
still i don't know if it's quite within our price range
mm
hmm
'cause you are talking about another component like another piece of hardware
yeah
yeah
mm
okay
are we agreed as to what our target group is though
pretty much so that we'd be looking for the younger end
well i i brought up some exactly but i think you raised some good questions about are there enough of these people out there
or are they making purchasing decisions
mm
you know these are the
yeah i was wondering that because i ag i agree that there there're people with uh how can i put it
mm
more money than sense and who are liable to buy something new but
i i s usually put more money than brains
yeah exactly
bu but what i was gonna say was
oh oh oh i'll make a note of that kate
good good comment
although they they may be buying um you know personal music devices and all that are they necessarily buying t. v. remote controls
because they probably live in a household that has a t. v. if they're at the lower end of the age range i don't know
yeah
it might be good to know um uh who you know who's actually buying televisions and are we in a uh uh s
yeah
region where people have more than one television in a home
mm
i think we've got a big hill to climb here haven't we
i mean we've gotta persuade people who've got a remote control 'cause it came with the telly that they should buy our product instead
yeah
mm
yeah
yeah
or do we s make sure that it goes to the man through the manufacturer
we sell to the manufacturer as the remote that goes with it
right good point
yeah yeah okay yeah
yeah
yeah
yeah
yeah
that's probably more what it is
yeah good point
what would be a more efficient way of doing it
yeah and and some of our d. v. d. players incidentally have them because we have the relationship with our own department but moreover we need to
mm-hmm
to go for the the manufacturers
okay
we're not gonna get any resolutions by the end of the day are we
right
probably not
mm
um the other thing that we're supposed to do is make decision on our functions
our functions we've so far decided i think that power channel volume make it attractive
um it has to have an enter key and of course the number keys
it has to have big user friendly buttons and sh n definitely we wanna be inspired that the current
styles are just plain awful
yeah
do we need um let me
is that agreeable to everyone
br actually um
mm-hmm
the enter key i have a chart here that i didn't include
mm-hmm
um
do you want the gizmo
yeah which might
throw some light on that
th yeah th those are
felt like had a lot of charts
um actually we're you know we are almost a half hour out of the forty minutes so we have to get close to finishing
okay
i i my only comment is i think maybe um we could somehow include an enter key in like a power key if power power was enter and pow that was my only just really in terms of streamlining
ah
mm-hmm
okay
um
enter power as a s oh um a sum simultaneous key
exactly
again you know thinking of menus or
is that okay with you
sorry i was miles away
would that uh-huh
h how does that work
i was re i was reading the chart to be honest
how so so how does that work how do you avoid switching the thing off when you actually wanna press enter
um
well if you're pressing enter the the thing would already be on and so maybe um when you press power initially it turns it on
press power again and use that as an enter um so you press power after you've um well i was thinking maybe you to turn it off you'd have to press power twice in succession
then you'd have to have an off te off key
okay yep mm-hmm
and maybe power follows something like a channel up channel down power and then that would make that choice
mm
it's not getting a bit complicated
could granny do this or are we just not aiming at granny
well
or y yeah
or something that has a a turning dial where at the far end is on or off
who's got an ipod then
yeah i don't um i wish
mm
anyway uh that was the only comment about um some of the the decisions
okay
people have made what's most important
it's definitely channel volume power
mm
yeah things like screen settings and audio settings i would generally
do them on the actual television itself like here you have a
exactly
you know a little flap th with a little control panel on the actual box itself
exactly
i i wouldn't know how to do it using a remote control so
yeah
um i would say that they are definitely less relevant
okay well
okay
thanks for looking at that
so i guess easy to use is the other thing that we want 'em to be able to do
mm-hmm
we don't wanna outsmart
as you said you know don't make it too hard for the granny
i just joined that set last week
hmm
um first grandchild arrived
congratulations
mm
uh
um so are we agreed then of those things
and let's go back to agenda and hook me up
d
mm
this oughta be fun
it probably won't go the first time it'll probably be like a g mess
come on
uh it lost it off here
oh you're fine
uh
it's fine
no it was up there but i couldn't see it down here
mm
this time it should be both
there we go
how do you do that
how do you make it do both
um you have to keep doing the financi the the f. n. and f. eight to five minutes to finish thank you a lot for telling me
ah okay it toggles through yeah
i think you have to cycle through
um right we're ready to close
yeah
um will be completed q questionnaire um then we'll have some time for individual work to continue our research um and i'll put some minutes of this meeting together
um your individual assignments are for
um kate to do the components for
you steph to do the user interface and for you the trend watching
um and each of us will get help from our coach
are we agreed to get ourselves together and then have lunch
yes
sounds good
okay
then that's the end of this meeting
and i hope that's good enough for her to tell her that's the end
okay
okay
we didn't come to any sort of decision on the functions though
well i think i went over the functions and wrote them down and marked them
alright well that's fine then
um that's what i went over and nobody was objecting to them
okay
um and you'd mentioned i i was just gonna say could you reiterate the new project requirements
because it they were it has to be for a t. v. just to keep myself
okay
um the teletext is outdated the internet is important
so we're still in meeting aren't we
yeah i think i've
it's only to be for a t. v. and it must include the corporate image
colour and slogan um which i think is more in the user uh range with steph
okay
mm
sorry what what actually are these is that the yellow and black
it doesn't tell me
mm
from their i'll just use it from their website
mm-hmm
okay
okay
okay
right
thank you
hi kate
just just carry on
okay carry on
alright um this is the beginning of the third meeting the conceptual design meeting
um our agenda should be um that we're opening the meeting i have the minutes from the previous meeting are on the shared f drive at this point
um and we should each have a presentation to make
um we have certain decisions to make and we have forty minutes total
it's twenty five after two at the moment so forty minutes is five after three um which i'll be keeping an eye on the clock for us
okay
um there are the decisions we have to turn to but we'll come back to them in a minute after i take us to the
minutes of the previous meeting
right um as we remember i opened the meeting the four of us were present the meeting the first meeting's minutes were reviewed and approved
um sarah you presented a marketing research report um which pretty much rep represented that fifteen to thirty five year olds uh it has to be hand held
power channel volume number keys possibly a speech recognition
and then steph did a second presentation um that those functions plus streamlining them with big user friendly keys that were easy to use
i think all of us agreed with those things
kate presented a working design of going after going over the basics on the whiteboard um that it should be a simple mass produced device
because of the twelve and a half pence cost
um but we did talk about possibly using rechargeable batteries and having a docking place as a selling point
um and the new requirements that it for be for t. v. only um and that it include the l so slogan and colour of the uh corporate design be included
um
the corporate image
so we agreed that the target market would be fifteen to thirty five with more money than sense that were decision makers
alternatively it would be a manufacturer to enclose it with the t. v. but it still should meet those parameters
um and that the function we agreed was volume power numbers enter channels a way to move between channels easy to use and hand held
um at that point we agreed that sarah would look at the current cost of competition what what do the current ones sell for
um and steph was gonna look at ec ergonomics
kate was gonna look at cost and feasibility of the various possibilities that we discussed
and i was to type up these minutes and work on the final report
is this a fair presentation of what our last meeting was
yeah
yes
mm-hmm
okay
right
so we're ready to close that and go back to our
that one
right
we're up to the point of the
go back
um the three presentations
so we're going to pull the plug on me and turn to sarah
is that okay
is that alright with everybody else
yep
mm-hmm
especially since kate asked to be last
sarah i'm sorry if i misspelled your name i didn't know whether it was s. a. r. a. or s. a. r. h.
i respond to either
no worries
you respond to whatever you get huh
okay
um did you do your hit
yeah
ah there it is
ta da
okay first thing i want to address is um one of the points that florence brought up which was uh current cost of the competition devices
similar to the ones that stephanie uh showed us and and they're uh twenty to sixty euros depending on uh branding
right
some of them that have a higher brand recognition are on the more expensive end
but i think that with the current um price that we're searching for we're well within even on the lower end of the uh of the market
mm 'kay
but i'm going to move on to more interesting um more vibrant things
so i investigated the remote control market in greater detail and my uh the theme of what i was to work on was uh trend watch
and
'kay
sorry
i'm glad to see the marketing budget is being so well spent on
i know that you all are a distance from cutting edge marketing research so you know i'm just gonna try to cloak it in really professional terms here
what's hot fruit and veg
spongy
and this is all over the catwalks paris milan and i'm talking about clothing furniture shoes
this is really interesting change from past years because it is much more organic um some would say approachable
mm
and i think if we're to refashion our view of what we want in a remote control we should perhaps think about incorporating technologically interesting fabrics
and some of the bold colours into a simple
handset
so
i also did a little research on um
what again are the most important priorities in uh decision making about uh purchasing
fancy
functional is out
and f the fancy and that's exactly the term i'm i'm thinking polished elegant you know kind of innovative but a cut above
this is twice as important as the next finding which is technologically innovative
this is interesting 'cause i think in the last meeting we were talking about technology as being so important
but maybe what's innovative is having it simple with um with uh technologically superior fabrics or uh you know designed in interesting substances
ease of use
again pretty low i mean it's the top three but each of the uh fancy and technologically innovative are far more important
so
i think we should cloak the streamlined remote control device in a series of fruit fruit themed sleeves
i think that's a good idea
y yeah you know
don't you
yes
it sounds like the the uh covers that they use for the remote you know your t your cell phone
exactly
exactly
i was thinking though that instead of having something uh like patterned you know so you know something similar to a summer dress
you know it would have like fruit and veg is that we actually make these spongy
mm
they could be ini initially i thought we could start with kind of um fruit that would suit kind of uh a long uh hand held
so banana pineapple and pear
um it could actually the sleeve could take up a lot of the development and the remote control we'd just need to get reductionist on it
they could be interchangeable they're spongy that goes back to ergonomic
and the youngsters love 'em fun for the whole family everyone can have their own
so what we're talking about is changing
this concept
everyone has a t. v. remote but then we add in the fact that they could each have their own individual fruit
that's what's hot on the catwalks
so this is my
this is what i'm thinking
hmm
uh-huh mm
in most families don't isn't the remote is a remote
y yeah
but i think i think what this would allow is perhaps a person in the family who had the most opinion about it we all need a remote
but the person who is really perhaps active in personalising
mm
i'm thinking the teenager
the someone fifteen to thirty five would go out and get this additional thing the same way as you mentioned that people would get the cell phone covers
so when your dad's sitting there overriding your decision
going no we're gonna watch this you can bring out your own remote and be like zap no we're gonna watch this
yeah
w and plus i think
mm
well actually some households do have three and four t. v. s and they would have a remote for each one so
uh yeah
yeah
yeah
so this is an idea and i i you know this is exactly what the research has uh has shown
so i really open this up to uh any other feedback
this spongy fruit and veg
yeah i i think we're gonna have some trouble when we get down to the component design on this
thanks
alright
yep
spongy is gonna be difficult i'm afraid
hmm
and as for
hmm
as for um well budgeting as well if we're gonna have lots of different interchangeable
i i just have my ear to the market guys
components
is this to the market
yeah i mean basically we can make these things out of wood titanium plastic or rubber
i suppose rubber is the closest to spongy yeah
is spongiest yeah
that would add
i was thinking titanium myself
i was thinking titanium i was thinking it's just i have been influenced by pictures of ipods and they're also minimalist and shiny
mm-hmm
they are and they they would fulfil the uh first um priority which is fancy
i think many of us would associate those with fancy
something else we could do is uh
call it something that's fruit and veg
oriented
we could call it uh
the name
are we talking about the device itself or the c or a cover for the device that would be an interchangeable cov cover as a separate
product
well it would be uh a a very simple product that would have a spongy sleeve that would be interchangeable
perhaps perhaps that desi that particular suggestion needs to go back to management and perhaps go to another group to actually design as a separate product
so
yeah but it's kind of pointless isn't it
yeah
that you know that might be
let's delegate
wo would that be agreeable
and then we could keep it titanium
yeah
w w would it be helpful if um i described the components a bit
because i think it would give you um maybe bring this discussion back to earth of what we can actually physically do
yeah maybe
or
do you wanna be next or you want kate to go next
i think possibly it might be more useful if kate went next
okay we'll move the
um
you can even have them in different flavours as well
so that if you just wanna sit there and chew on the remote it could be like pear flavour yeah
yeah
or s or smelly
scratchy
scratch and sniff
uh well i was really thinking a lot about the i. uh the imac kind of gel gem tone
right well i i i think some of this um you're gonna be a little disappointed with some of the things i have to tell you
it's hot on the streets guys
but i'm afraid this is the real world
so um
i've been looking at the the basics of how these devices actually have to work in order to operate
and i've had some discussions with the ma manufacturing division who have told me what's actually available
you know what the current state of the art in components is and some of the exciting new things they've got
but i'm not sure that it's quite what you want um
now this isn't a very good overhead but this is just to show you this is the innards of a remote control um
i really need a pen or something but uh does my mouse work
no
um oh yeah can you see my little mouse pointer
mm
right
this is this is the a a a remote that's been opened up and that's the the back of the interface
mm
and this is a push button one so you see these little little buttons here
they're little rubber rubber buttons that go through onto the the board at the back and they push these buttons here
um and we that's the basic construction that we've got to got to accommodate
we got to have something that pushes the little buttons that um talk to the chip that encodes the message that sends the the message to the receiver
so um i wan i wanna go through not not just addressing the um uh the the points that you made
sarah but um doing my presentation in the order i wrote it
so first of all um i wanna talk about what possibilities we've got for the energy source
um we can have your bog standard double double a. batteries in a replaceable um little compartment
we can have a hand sorry a wind up yeah which i think is quite an interesting concept for a sorry for a remote control
a wind up
but i it maybe is doesn't quite go with the um the fruit and veg
um one that one that i think is quite interesting is the kinetic energy source
alright
remember we only have forty minutes
where um you you actually get the energy by moving the device which is quite a ni a nice and neat one
mm
hmm
you have to it means that if it's sitting there for a long time it probably won't work
but you have to sort of throw it between your hands every now and then it'll work
hmm
or we we had talked about solar power but i thing that we agreed that that's not so good in the dark
mm
now i'm afraid this is the options we've got on on the case
it can be made of plastic rubber wood o if you like or titanium
hmm
um and the nearest we've got to st to spongy there i guess is rubber but um
i'm gonna come back to the advantages of titanium and basically it can have a flat surface a curved surface or a double curved surface
hmm
but i think if we wanna use standard components we're gonna have difficulty with anything much beyond that
hmm
okay what does the interface look like
um well push button that's that's the one we're all familiar with
um we can have scroll buttons and the the scroll button can incorporate a push
hmm
so you can have it like on a mouse where you can use it to go up and down
change volume or channel or something like that and push to
select something
um you can have multiple scroll buttons um this is maybe getting a little bit complicated but um it's it the technology is there
and we can also incorporate an l. c. d. display in the remote but this will increase the cost
um the electronics that actually makes the device work we've basically got three
simple regular advanced and the price goes up as we choose each of this
if we want the nice cheap one the simple then we can only have push buttons
all the other fancy interface designs go out the window i'm afraid
um pay a little bit more for a regular chip and you can have scroll buttons
if you want the advanced chip it obviously costs more but it that's what you need if you want the l. c. d. display
and the manufacturing devision tell me that they have recently developed um sample sensor sample speaker devices
now i don't know what that is but i think they think it's quite important and we might want to incorporate it somewhere
um ou our real expertise is in push buttons i have to say but maybe you think that's old technology
mm
and well i i think we've got two options
we can either go for a really cheap model keep all of the costs down
um which means a flat plastic case with an ordinary battery and simple push buttons
or we can have something that looks a bit nicer i think it um won't necessarily l uh look like a pineapple but um
that may or may not be a good thing
sorry
um but it could have an l. c. d. screen and it could have multiple scroll buttons
and it could have the the company's new development of the um sample sensor and speaker
so thank you
that sounds good
any idea you you mentioned that there would be a cost difference
um do you have any idea if if this could if the fancy model could be done in twelve euros fifty
yeah i'm afraid i don't have that information available
um
manufacturing didn't actually give attach any prices to any of this i'm afraid
hmm
hmm
because you know what i'm being quite serious when i say that that um the things i mentioned are hot
but i think the important thing might be to choose one
yeah mm-hmm
you know if if what you're telling me is is um some of these things aren't just f aren't feasible
maybe we could something about naming we could call it you know blackberry
that's uh
bear bear in mind it has to be the colours and styles of the company
so what i had been thinking was something chunky and yellow and plastic with black buttons with a logo on it
banana
alright well let's see then
but um
i i don't know how important that is to keep it exactly the colours of the real reaction company
yeah
it's just what i'd understood we'd be doing
yeah
that's before i heard about all this hot tips about the future fruit wise
but yeah i'm trying to streamline mine a little bit
we we could we could do um a double curved rubber one which would allow um say a banana
but um unfortunately i see from my notes that if we do that we have to have a push button as the interface we can't do anything fancier
yeah
hmm
shall we wait 'til i've 'til i've showed you what well my extensive presentation on what sort of interfaces are available
yeah
mm
yep
thank you kate
thank you kate
mm
you did seem to include just in more detail what i've got though
so so mine's a bit pointless
right
f. n. and f. eight did you say
yes
there we go
i don't have it on mine though
oh i think um
florence resolved it by
i if you do f. uh f. n. f. eight again it's it'll
do it again
f. eight again
keep doing it until you get it in both you get it there you get it yours without that one and then you get it with both
i think it yeah you you will do an
should i do it again
maybe
yeah
this time it should come up both
right then
i don't actually have a huge amount of different information then what kate says just
okay
that my method was to look at the well my my inspirations
which was a big collection of lots of different models of remote controls and other things that use a similar sort of thing including m. p. three players uh
mm-hmm
like you know hi fi remotes not just television and these things
mm
uh having a think about the feature of ea the features of each ones
um what functions we actually need and then how to group and arrange these on the actual
the actual plastic or rubber hand held piece
uh i've been especially interested in the ipod style scroll wheel which
well i couldn't find a the picture of the ipod w only linked to a web browser
so i couldn't copy and paste it but it had a similar thing to this thing on the right
it has uh scroll wheels without without a display but they they scroll like a computer mouse
hmm
so i was thinking that uh um a really simple
hmm
a really simple interface with just a couple of scroll things on it um and then instead of a display the display could appear on the television screen
like i guess an existing
sky or cable one does
like you know you press enter and it comes up with what's showing on that channel at the moment
and you can do you can scroll along and it'll show you what's on in the next half hour
and you scroll up and you can see what's on the other channels while you're watching
the same channel on the screen
uh but i'm also equally taken with this chunky plastic kiddie remote
mm
um which is really nice and fun and good to hold and nice big easy buttons to press but still quite simple and quite cost effective
so
what seems kind of ideal for me would be to just have
a fairly simple uh not fancy but not totally minimalist i mean just pretty simple plastic
probably i was thinking yellow and black just because that's the company's colours with very very few buttons
but that would correspond to a screen that would appear on the television screen like you know
just small along the bottom instead of instead of having the ipod style display screen on the actual remotes which is far too expensive
hmm
and when you've got a screen sitting there in front of you you might as well have it appearing uh on the screen in front of you
mm
it doesn't obscure much of the actual picture you're watching
yeah
and so on that you can just much in the same way as an existing sky remote scroll along scroll up and down
yeah i'd i'd certainly support that idea
and uh and i definitely support uh the use of plastic and or rubber
i mean titanium would be great but i think it might be a bit too expensive and too kinda spacey
if we're k trying to keep it
colourful and slightly organic then i think titanium's too
futuristic
it's difficult to make fancy shapes in it as well we can't for example have a double curved case in titanium unfortunately
yeah
whereas a plastic's so cheap and easy and mouldable and everything else
hmm
uh then
and the the having the the the screen on the television screen i think is a good idea
'cause um otherwise we're we're putting up the price not only for putting building the l. c. d. in but for the electronics as well
and it's a little bit pointless as well i think
it's a duplication
like when when when you've got when you've got the screen there it doesn't have to be anything fancy just a little menu showing yeah
there is that
a menu you go into one menu and then it can have your different options whether you wanna change the settings or the
mm-hmm
you know your information about programme that's on at the moment
i don't think that's to taxing to uh
s engineer
um
but as for actually arranging them let me go back to the
to the picture of the kiddie one
and i quite like it 'cause it's just smooth and hand held and it's got these easily reachable buttons that quite nicely uh spaced out
so something a bit like that with
buttons arranged in a
kind of circle
mm-hmm
up down left right
do you want scroll buttons in that as well
i i was thinking not actually scroll like a like mouse scroll but you know a i can't quite d uh describe it
you see
on the one on the right down at the bottom is the mouse
yeah see where the mouse is like this s style thing where you c have up down left and right
mm-hmm
right
and enter in the middle so you pick your menu and then your different options and when when you click on each one
it you can go into a new menu for that
i'm getting a bit uh specific here
really we'd have to use something to show you but
yeah
i think i think that's a g nice clean design it's playing to our strengths which are in push button technology
to uh m make it
if i don't think i can get it up on the screen
ah here we go
right
oh nice
um hmm
well the ipod spinning wheel is uh really complicated
huh
it does scroll but it is hugely complicated
yeah
mm
what else have we got
wow
them they're terrible
but they all have this this feature of this uh
it's not quite a scroll wheel but
it's a selection wheel
it's a kind of selection in this circle which i think is a really good idea
but we can implement it with simple push buttons which is much cheaper
yeah like up down left and right
which is good
and then and then
yeah so i mean either a channel up and down volume up and down
next appearing programmes up and down uh and then also when you get into the different menus on the screen
it's got your things like settings and contrast up and down
okay
so all you really need is these four buttons with the enter in the middle
okay
and that's it
look at look at this one
in fact
oh that's really nice
almost impossible to misplace or l or lose
do you think with um
might take up your whole living room
it seems that that uh you guys are quite keen on the plastic perhaps the something reminiscent of the child's remote
do you think we could put it in a in a fruit colour
and have it abstract
you know we could call like a fruit name but it would be a little more abstract
possibly
yeah
hmm
mm
that also is possible
we we could actually do it in rubber instead of plastic if you'd rather if you feel if you like the spongy
mm-hmm
i'm just just throwing out ideas
just
or call it a or call it a banana and have it in yellow
hmm
yeah
i'm thinking maybe we need to be a little bit more abstract if the
design constraints are so
okay
yeah
uh just something else i need to bring to your attention is have you have you seen these on a remote
this is actually the volume up and down but they both say v. on them which when you first look at it
mm-hmm
mm-hmm
you expect that to be the down because it looks like a downward pointing arrow but it's actually the v. to indicate that it's the volume so
mm-hmm
yeah
hmm
mm-hmm
uh we do need to avoid little ambiguities like these
yeah
hmm
nice
good point
but we wouldn't have a specific volume up and down
if we're having the scroll wheel then it's gonna double up as all the other up and down functions
mm 'kay
but then that's complicated
i wanna thank you all for all your presentations
we have about ten minutes left in which time we have to make some decisions on the remote control concepts
um and i think you all have been self stimulating of working together
um we need to come up with some specifics of the components um the materials
things like making the decision on the energy um and the case and the interface type things
so let's
mm
right
they want us to decide
what form of energy are we going to use
which the choices that we've discussed were pretty much battery kinetic or solar
um this is where kate's expertise comes in and our decision making will be a little bit guided by kate at this point
the
you were saying that the kinetic would be useful
that is you just have to move it some and you'd be able to use it um as opposed to a battery that you have to either put it in a recharger or um keep replacing the batteries
um
or solar that you'd have difficulty with it if it's a dark day that it'll die on you and no way to do it
that's the day you wanna use the t. v.
mm
um so what's our pleasure here what would be the cost consequences of each of the three
oh unfortunately i don't have costing information
okay
i i in terms of workability i i think the the two front runners are the standard battery or the kinetic
but i'm sorry i don't figures on the difference in cost
mm 'kay
what's the uh feelings of the group on the kinetic
i've used kinetic in terms of watches and it's very very uh handy you don't even notice
um that it's there
it sounds great
i've never come across it before but it sounds fantastic
sounds like it could be g a really good economical it would make the whole thing a lot lighter more convenient
it's
mm-hmm
hmm
it could tie in with the fanciful design as uh you know throw the banana you know just gotta keep it moving
hmm
yeah
'cause it's really a quite attractive thought isn't it
it's like yeah a good selling point
so the consensus seems to be use the kinetic if it's at all possible
be
but it does depend how much
it costs
i mean how much it costs and how much more development and research it needs
yeah
mm
and and how much you do have to keep it moving 'cause i'm conscious that watching t. v. can be quite a sed sedentary activity
mm
yeah
mm-hmm
but i could market that as a um as a a i was thinking actually a a cost saver down the road in terms of battery you know
mm
do your exercises while you're watching the t. v.
yeah
hmm
true yeah m more more environmentally friendly
yeah that's what i was thinking as well
mm-hmm
yeah
you know kind of the
thanks for the reminder for five minutes to finish thanks
um the next thing that they wanted us to do was look at chip on print as a decision
oh right okay i'd that that's something i maybe should have covered
um
chip on print is just a manufacturing technique um and i would certainly recommend it i think because i'm not sure i have an alternative
oh
okay
i i it it's just the way that the the the uh th the way it's ac it's actually built and you you print onto the circuit board like you might print onto paper
what about the ca yeah
oh the way we uh-huh
oh okay
um what about the case
i think they're talking there about do we want wood plastic titanium or rubber and i think we've discussed not having titanium
one it's too expensive um and second it won't do this double um curves
um we've sort of eliminated wood
we said plastic or rubber
what's the pleasure
well if if sarah's keen on a spongy feel
the the rubber that we're talking about is the same as you have in those little stress balls so it's yeah
that's exactly what i was thinking
i'm sold
what about you
do you not think it might need
like a kind of
a hard plastic inner shell with the actual delicate workings inside and then a kind of spongy
mm
kind of like an internal egg
cover
yeah s thick spongy cover so it feels like the whole thing's spongy but actually you're not damaging anything by squeezing it
uh-huh
plastic inside
yeah
because i mean you could just get carried away with the with the tac
yeah
i'd i'd need to talk to manufacturing again about whether that's actually possible but i agree it's uh sounds like a nice idea if it is
yeah
well you do get a bit carried away with things that are tactile you just wanna stroke them and squeeze them and
hmm
and with sports on television
okay
you know
um the next part they want is the user interface concept
i su
i should i should r
i'm sorry to push you but we only have a couple minutes to finish with
then i'll just say i support either from a marketing point of view i support either decision that the designers make on that
okay and it says interface
what type and what supplements
just copy the one on the left
no um a scroll
well like four buttons up down left and right with enter in the middle that will correspond to a menu on the screen
which i think technically is just push button and uh i'd certainly support that that that brings the cost down quite a lot and it's something that we're an ex the company's an expert on
yeah i'd like push buttons with
so push buttons
okay um
that's that
um this is gonna sound weird but the next meeting starts in thirty minutes
whew
and they actually want a look and feel design user interface design you can look and see this as well as i can
marketing they want product evaluation
no it's still it's still plugged in on mine actually
no we can't actually
oh
oh my i'm sorry
that's why i was looking over your shoulder
oh okay
sorry about that
missed that one
this ought to be fun trying to get this thing to work
ah ta da
now it's gone again
ah
you know i think the the company's s next project should to design a better overhead device that switches immediately
yes because i can't even see mine
next meeting starts in thirty minutes these are the individual actions
oh yes
yeah right
um the look and feel design is for kate uh steph gets the user interface design you get product evaluation
mm
um the two of you get to play with a pla modelling clay um to do a prototype
great
uh and everybody gets individual instructions in the usual way
sounds good
anything else we need to do
i don't think so
go to it
play doh
and that's the end of this meeting
that's for her benefit
that's really all i got guys
um almost there's one more thing i have to get out of the i have to make sure that this attachment will open
i keep forgetting whether i've done this
ah ha
okay
we'll open that when the time is right
in the meantime
closing things down okay
let's see what this thing does
does it come up together or disappear one of them or what
ah we came up together we're good
okay
are we ready to start
okay
it's now quarter of four
this is a f another forty minute one so it will end at four twenty five
okay
right
our agenda is as before for me to open the meeting for us to go over the previous minutes
then for the two of you to present your prototype and for you to g um sarah present the evaluation criteria
we then have a finance aspect which is a spreadsheet an excel spreadsheet
and i know what you're all thinking of oh my
um because we're only given a forty minute time period to get it all in including the production evaluation
so we're going to make a very fast track
okay
um and as you can see that's what we do next on this thing
so the first thing i have to do is close this so that i can get to
where is it
red
i need to open mine
not the agenda
agenda three
no that th i want the minutes from the previous minutes
mm
that should be there minutes
yeah
okay
uh from meeting three is it alright with you if i don't switch it to show just use it as is
'cause this way i can more easily flip it
okay um obviously all of us were here for the last meeting we reviewed the previous minutes before that um each of you made your presentations
um we discussed the various possibilities based on what was presented in those presentations
the market trend of fruit and veg mm spongy uh fancy and elegant more than technologically innovative and that more than easy
um we decided chip on print would be used
um we would use plastic with a rubber casing i think was the consensus powered by kinetic energy
there was no decision made on the curvatures or double curvature or straight
um perhaps the prototype will give us an inkling of that
um looking like a scroll but it's really a push button technology excuse my spelling
um that was actually in use
that is uh behind the scenes is push button which we uh according to kate have a very good uh grasp on doing that in production
um we decided that separate fashionable covers covering your fruit and veg might be a separate product that could be suggested to management
um and as suggested um yellow with black buttons with the company logo
a slogan and image might be a good idea based on the requirements that have been provided to us
um we did have a few production issues and coordination of the various bits and we had some conflict of ideas and cost constraints and we ran out of time
um we had to follow that up and prepare for the last one
and uh we closed as it ran out of time
is that a fair presentation of what happened
yes
yep
okay back to this meeting
um we're down to the prototype presentation
ta da
alright
over to you
right
well
ooh two
yeah well you see each made one we didn't have enough yellow dough
ah
this is the one
that i made
uh-huh
it is uh curved easy to hold hand held nice and small with big easy buttons
this is
like a scroll but they are push buttons and they enter takes you into the different menus
of course we need someone who's experienced with the television
i mean this is the infrared thing that's gonna zap at the television
uh i'm not quite sure how to make that but i'm sure it will work
uh this is on off switch 'cause i think we do need that and i think it gives it a nice balance
and it's gonna have the logo imprinted on it uh in there
'kay
okay
um as for what it's actually made of well the function of these buttons is up down left and right in the different menus
okay
uh position i presume that just means
right right on it easy to see
the main feature of it is just a simple design simple lack of uh buttons all over the place
right
form
curved kind of smooth hand held makes it feel nice to hold
uh material i think kate's gonna tackle that quite a bit but i think we have two different options
because we did make a another one which wa uh is in the shape of banana it's just if you can imagine this as yellow with black buttons
mm-hmm
like just like this but in the shape of a banana
mm-hmm
which is also nice and easy to hold and feels good and has a similar sort of scroll push button technology
just a slightly different design
also with on off switch and infrared uh i had envisioned it in hard smooth plastic
so like uh well i dunno what's it like
i guess like an existing remote control but molded and smooth
whereas otherwise we'd thought like with this one or mix and match
just we were gonna see what you thought the uh a more spongy rubber cover with spongy buttons
so we have the two options we can follow either the smooth hard plastic or the spongy rubber depending on cost restraints
and what we
well what conclusion we reach when we discuss it
uh material yeah that's what i have to say about material
can i scroll down on there and see what else
mm-hmm
well colour i think i definitely have a preference towards bright yellow with black buttons
because that's the company colours but if anybody's got any other suggestions i'm quite willing to consider them as well
so it just depends what you think about these ideas and if i'm yeah maybe kate you better say what you think about them
um well i don't have very much to add
um the the case oops that's the uh on off button just come off our prototype
the the case can be either um spongy rubber or hard plastic
we're not absolutely sure about a combination of the two but it can be either of those
we have the technology to do that
um and as for the the actual components um uh steph just said this is a quite a cheap device to manufacture
we have simple rubber push buttons um which provide all the functionality we need
um the um the diode that actually does the um infrared is at the end
it's the stalk of the banana or it's just the thing at the end of this version
um so that's for material
colour well uh steph's the expert on colour
um we we don't have any particular restrictions on that
yeah i think that's all we've got to say really
i thin as for as for the fruit or organic theme i guess this one is obviously fruit shaped
this one has n banana yeah
a banana
this one has no obvious connections to fruit but because it's round and molded
it kinda makes you think sort of organic touchy feely kiddie it's more like yeah
you'd expect it to be like a child's sorta toy remote control instead of a real one which i quite like that sort of image
'cause it's very big and chunky and child friendly and
would you care to examine the prototypes see how they feel in the hand
hold them you see you know
curvature is it to your liking
oh i see the on off's in the back
yes that's so that your index finger automatically goes straight to it
if you don't wanna tire out your thumbs after all
and then you can use your thumb
and it was partly we thought the design looked better
yeah
but it could be moved if if marketing feel it's important to have the on off button in a different place
i could see this thing unless it's reinforced having a problem with the
breaking oh right
you know yeah
well you see that's why hard plastic would be quite a good thing for it because then it'd just be rigid
i like the fact that on both of them the keys play such a prominent role
hmm
it's really kind of a
yeah we really like we really like that design i mean it looks just like a logo that arrangement of the keys
like a c like a compass point you know just up
mm-hmm mm-hmm
down left and right and we think we could make that quite a good feature
and it's like the the ipod scroll wheel but better
yeah
but it's also like texting you don't
yeah
yeah yeah i mean it that's what it makes me think of mobile phones
hmm
i was try i was thinking moving your thumb like this what does that remind me of
yeah
and it's a very simple design there's not a lot to wrong the components are cheap to make
it's texting
it's also in terms of um being lost it's it's quite it looks quite different
hmm
you know i i d i have several four remotes
and they all look the same until you get up close and you have to you know this is really identifiable
yeah
i mean the thing is we do need to develop our technology of i mean actually how to program the menus and what sort of
mm-hmm
you know text box is gonna appear at the bottom of the screen but we do definitely think that it's a viable option
mm-hmm
okay
the next item is evaluation
no okay
uh if that's if you're finished
um
uh yeah we're finished
mm-hmm
shall i take your uh power
oh sorry
oh
try again
okay
this is going to be a heavily interactive evaluation
and the method here is to evaluate the new remote control in terms of the user requirements and the hot trends introduced by the marketing department
so this means we're going to go over the priorities that were raised by uh the consumers
a as well as incorporate all of our insight into this uh evaluation exercise
so i'm going to go and use the whiteboard and i've made a list of criteria to look at
and so i'm gonna i'm gonna leave this up as the last thing
but for the evaluation it's going to be one is true and seven is false going over these different criteria
so one true seven false and i'm gonna now use the um the board
okay
so um
fancy
technologically innovative
easy to use trendy
buttons
excess buttons good buttons
ugly
sellable
and other
and in fact i hope that uh you all introduce some additional terms
because these are things that um have been brought up some of them seem rather close like they overlap
yeah what about price is that gonna go on there as well
mm yeah price
price of materials
hmm
we'll put price up at the top
not that we actually know anything about it but we can we can pretend
well we will soon unfortunately
um
okay so
come on
did you say
no
uh okay so
wha how do we feel in terms of is this fancy
it depends what what you mean by fancy really 'cause when i think of fancy
i think of it's got lots of extra sort of fripperies and you know like
baroque curliness and which
mm-hmm
i'd call these quite uh minimalist
yes a plain simple clean design
simple and plain but i mean i do see what it is heavily reliant on appearance instead of pure functionality so in that respect it is quite fancy
mm-hmm
i yeah so in that respect i think we'll go with that respect
i think just maybe we need a different word other than fancy i'd say maybe aesthetic
yeah
well we have got s trendy further down but
elegant
elegant
elegant
elegant i don't know if i'd call them elegant
yeah no these aren't the exact terms that the um
like stylish or aesthetic
yeah
stylish yeah
elegant
we're gon let's use elegant although the the the people the word on the street is is
fancy
yeah
n that um
did you just break the pen
yeah uh the uh is fancy
so let's let's take it to the next level
well d we'll just call it fancy then
well okay so in terms of elegant fancy
we'll call it e. f. um do we do we think that perhaps and maybe we should say the yellow
should we go with the yellow in terms of i think that's a really superior they're both
yeah i think we n we need to they're both yellow with black buttons it's just that we didn't have any more dough to represent uh that
yeah
but if you can just imagine banana shape with these bits as black
mm
yeah
so what we re really need to decide is whether we want the actual banana shape
or just a a purely blob or some sort of abstraction in between the two that isn't that is more curved
yeah
like a banana but that isn't actually recognisable as a banana you know with the grooves and the stalk and stuff so
as a banana
i think that many of us are abstract enough to look at the yellow one and say we'll call it the banana
yeah
and of the two i really like i m i like the banana but i i do like the chunk
the chunk
so that's maybe not something we have to decide just right now is it
no but i mean in terms we have to evaluate one of them
just somewhere a long the scale of in between these two
unless do you guys wanna evaluate both
i think between the two somewhere between the two is true
yeah i'd
it's more true than false about a two
okay
so we say true
um
technologically innovative
i d i don't think that's what we're aiming at with this concept
yeah
i think we're using simple components that are gonna be robust but not particularly innovative
so we'll say we'll say uh false
easy to use
very
yes
one is that inappropriate
mm-hmm
yeah
okay
oh pardon me
um
trendy
trendy s and i say specifically spongy fruity
oh yes
mm-hmm
well maybe only a two or a three then 'cause it's no we still haven't decided about specific sponginess or specific
we have the worry about how robust it will be if it's it's curved as a banana but spongy
hmm
i think yeah
okay
yeah i don't really think that's gonna work but
okay so two
yeah
um
excess buttons
are there excess buttons
no
no
no
that is false
so that's false
um good well designed buttons intuitive buttons
better more intuitive buttons yes
true
ugly
no
no
no
people don't respond well to ugly
sellable uh quirky you know something people like oh yeah
yeah i think they're different aren't they
well it is quite it is quite quirky i think
i like it
yeah i do too
it could be quite a good brand like
oh yeah
a good little object
and i was i was thinking of other things um in terms of uh could we say it's cost saving
with the
oh we also need tho think about the energy
is it the kinetic energy
yeah with the energy
if it's it is gonna be environmentally friendly with the kinetic energy
mm
yeah
it is going to be kinetic
yeah
mm-hmm
yeah we'll c we'll say it's a cost saving enviro
uh so yes
yeah but we haven't
completely developed that side of it yet so we're not completely sure about that but yeah
well you're still in the play doh stage
yeah
anything else
including price do you have any idea about price or other features
well i think our instinct is that it should be pretty cheap to develop
we haven't got a lot of expensive components in there
okay
yes the instinct says true
so true one or should i go to two or three
i'd put it at one i think but i dunno what do you
okay
i would say maybe a two 'cause we still we need to uh get somebody in who is good with the programming for the menus
yeah true it might be the yeah yeah true
and things
i mean it's not just like i mean it's not like ev you know on a normal chunky remote every button res i mean means something different
yeah that's not a cheap thing to get
true
whereas this one has only got the four buttons and they all they mean everything depending on what menu you're in
hmm
yeah that's a good point
uh we need somebody to develop that
um
other
anything else you guys can thing of
and i'm gonna actually change a couple of these so then i'm gonna instead of ugly i'm gonna say it's attractive and then make that true
so that 'cause i have to do an average
yeah
right
and then um excess buttons
just putting no excess buttons
exactly
wow we're doing really well
yeah be you know so it doesn't ruin the polarity
as for see if we're technologically innovative i'd say it is quite innovative
because there aren't really many that have this menu idea instead of all the extra buttons
mm-hmm
i mean i know we're not doing anything involving internet or speech recognition
but but we are at the upper end of the push button market
or l. c. d.
yeah
well if you g uh let me know if if any of these um if you if you all can think of any other um thing to change here if you th if you think i should change the innovative or add other features
if not i'll average those
i think we're good
okay
mm
okay
so
we're a little over halfway through the meeting and the next big thing is the finance
okay
um okay how about if i uh pass this back to you and i'll uh figure out the average here
yep
right
thank you for everyone's help with that
right
and as you can see it says the same thing it had not lost itself thank goodness
and we're going to raise what's called a sp a spreadsheet that they provided to me
um
and
it says fill in the number of components you plan to use in your device
hand dynamo battery kinetic solar cells
okay
well just kinetic then
yeah
yeah
um
what's a hand dynamo
that was the crank wind up crank on the side
it's the wind up
oh shoot forget that
kinetic is um and how many of those will we need per we only need one
just one
okay
electronic simple chip on print and we'll need one of those
uh uh yeah i think we can do it all with simple
just checking that
yeah simple 'cause we've just got push buttons so we can do it all with simple which is the ch should be the cheapest
okay and we only need one of those
yep
okay the case will be uncurved and flat or a single curve or a double curve
it looks like it single curve 'cause of th the chunkiness
it's that's uh uh one
yeah that that one is single curve isn't it
um do we have
what does double curved mean i don't understand
and that's
i i think you it means you reverse the curve
uh that's the the one that goes like this
oh no we don't need that
yeah
no
yeah i do i don't think we need that for either of them you can do a banana in single curve yeah
right
single curved i'd say
no single curve
okay case material supplements
plastic wood rubber titanium special colour
i
i just wanna say plastic
we had the special colour
and did we say plastic
yeah can we do some what ifs 'cause it may i mean i i still quite like the idea of combining plastic and rubber myself
one two three four five six
yeah
but it depends on the cost i guess
okay
we'll come back if we can to the rubber being added at the moment that's where we are
interface button push button interface
it's just button
yeah
that's what we're using isn't it
yes
yep
yeah
do we need to say how many buttons or
whoops don't want that not yet
or d is it just one
um
no it just says push button interface
button supplements they'll be in a special colour of black
'kay
and the buttons
wha what is the buttons made of rubber
uh they'll be rubber yep
so we need one of them
and are they any special form
well yeah like the compass point one
actually does tha does special material mean that plastic is not a special material
'cause i think they can be plastic
'cause the rate we're going we can put the rubber on top
yeah
they could be plastic we don't have to have rubber buttons because we haven't got a double curved case
oh
yeah they could be plastic
okay
um
let's put that rubber in then of the case material supplement
it's just one isn't it
uh we only need one of them
um and the total cost has been calculated as nine pounds twenty out of the twelve and a half we were allowed
what we're in
yeah
we're in
that's us
more profit
great
okay i'm going to save this into our
desktop project documents
okay
as our project document bit
do you do you need to double click on that to open it
yeah
there we are
that's the only excel document that will be in there so it's there for all of us
okay so are they under twelve fifty
yes go to the project evaluation next slide
yes
right
um the project process satisfaction with for example the room for creativity
yeah leadership
sure
yeah
teamwork
yes
means of having whiteboard the digital pens and all that kind of good things
and play doh
uh-huh
yeah
yeah yeah the play doh was best i thought
yeah well 'cause i mean it's so hard to describe what you mean just with words and pointing at photographs and saying
well we quite want this but imagine it rounder
so much better just to go and
you know this is it this is what we want
yep
okay
so we went over all those things and we're satisfied with all the above
yep
um did we find any new ideas
i think with the marketing element of uh fruit shaped i i mean i that really opened my eyes
yeah
spongy
i i only speak for myself though
and i'd never heard of the kinetic energy before so
yeah
good work as a design team because we
yeah i think we're a good team actually
i'm not sure all the wires are really great though
so we actually worked well as a group
i thought so
right
are the costs within the budget
oh yes
yes
yes
yes
is the project evaluated
yes
yes
yes
i can give you a number um it's uh the average evaluation score is one point eight eight
oh hang on we haven't heard
uh-huh
so it means w you know i can i can spell it out
there were six true or ones four um pardon me
two s almost true or close to true so that was four points
and then uh one false seven points so seventeen divided by nine we're between one and two
i would say that's ex excellent
in terms of uh ho how much we adhere to the ideals of the uh market place
yeah
and the the only false one is because we've chosen
to maintain old technology exactly
to keep a simple old technology which if it works perfectly well i see no point in improving on if it works so
mm-hmm
yeah yeah
absolutely and it's kept us within budget
yes
yeah
mm-hmm
so we do count as i think excellent or one
alright
and we've therefore we have to do the final questionnaire and do the meeting summary i have a final report to present um and then we're done
okay
we done good and we're finished in time
bring on the ice sculptures
nice
and then we get the product launch party
so we might have to wait
yeah
product launch party
yeah
that's what i said ice sculptures
absolutely
um i one thing i want to do is oh i think the meeting's done
is that the end of the meeting
i believe that is the end of our meeting
yeah
thank you melissa
um one thing i wa i wanna do is save everything in the right files because i don't think everything is saved
the right files
final meeting market
right so
start of the first meeting
mm-hmm
uh
right so agenda of the first meeting
where we uh
we have twenty five minutes for this meeting
okay
we uh are to get acquainted
so does everyone want to say who they are
that seem sensible
yeah
i'm robin
i'm the marketing manager
i'm louisa
i'm the user interface designer
i'm nick
i am the industrial designer
and i'm alastair and i'm the project leader
alright okay so tool training
um
project plan
so does anyone have any uh thoughts
as to the tool training that uh is required
tool training
i'm not exactly sure what you mean by tool training
neither am i
oh i see so we shouldn't really be
oh right okay so
so we have the project team which is to um basically to come up with a new r remote control device
uh we have uh the starting base was the original which has been in existence now for a period of time
and uh our idea is to uh
to make the new remote control device uh more user friendly than the previous one and to to be trendier
to be with it and therefore to uh to get a bigger market share and bigger audience
yeah
so um method of doing this is uh split up as you can see into uh
the functional design the conceptional design and the detailed design
so um
in each of these uh phases we'll uh basically be handing over to yourselves the designers of this uh
yes
this device
and uh having uh meetings so that we can uh during the course of the day um come up with a
better better inst implement than we had before
and therefore um have a successful uh conclusion to the day
um
and you'll be doing uh various designs uh throughout the day to meet this end
mm-hmm okay
so we've got tool training
try out whiteboard
uh
so we will um
right so everyone's to uh supposedly uh draw their favourite animal over on the white board over there
i guess this is uh make sure the whiteboard works
so uh i don't know who wishes to go first
okay
do you wish to go f have a first bash at uh whatever
i don't mind
i dunno
um
ah uh
let's see
good job i got pockets today
your microphone's just
but now you you uh you'll move out from the microphone and the camera
i take it that
are we supposed to do this right now do you think or
i would i would guess so
or
yeah
you've lost uh your microphone there
i don't know
oh
technical problems
right here we go
i mean you designers are meant to come up with these sort of things
okay
i think that i would have to say that my favourite animal is the cat
little smiley cat there
um and this would be
because they're very independent uh they're very intelligent compared to dogs maybe
um and they can be very very affectionate
some people don't think so but i know very affectionate cats
um
um and they can look after themselves
next
okay yeah
i'll i'll
shall i rub that out actually
i don't see as there's any need to
there's plenty of space
i mean whatever
we can have have a whole menagerie
exactly
shall i see if i can get across without just tangling everything
okay
there's one
we've had more time to prepare over this side so we've all stuck our bits and pieces in our pockets
didn't think of that
'kay uh pens are over here
the three pens are underneath
i'll try the red pen
okay
um
i'm gonna go for the bear which i'm be able to draw very well but
you get marks for artistic impression
i'll have a bash at it
uh
ooh ooh i lost it there
i think i've just knocked the microphone
um
so you're just doing the face
we'll g then we'll go for a a s small small bear
um and i like my animal that looks nothing like a bear because um
i dunno maybe because there's so many cartoon characters made up after the bear like the jungle book characters and stuff like that
great
right
hello
um i'm gonna go for the dog and i'm gonna draw one badly as well
uh
looks like it's going to be a dachshund or something
that's quite good
right
there's my dog
um i like dogs because they're very loyal
and they're always happy so whenever whenever you're feeling sort of a bit a bit down or tired they're always coming up and they're always um quite excited
so um you can always have a lot of fun with a dog
and they're also good for exercise as well
you can sorta get out and they they sorta never get tired
and and when they're tired they're quite cute as well so
okay that's why i like dogs
right um
well i've not actually had too many pets uh over my uh time 'cause to be honest with you uh
i'm not too keen on them anyway
not to worry
so what my daughters have got at the moment is they've got uh a few fish and so hopefully um won't prove too difficult to draw
uh
as you can see that my artist artistic work is useless as well
anyway um
and uh one of the best uh things about fish is that they don't really take uh too much looking after because uh with most of the animals if you're going away on holiday or whatever
you've gotta spend money or get a friend or whatever to look after them for you
whereas if you got fish
you just gotta put the food in a a a dripper feed which feeds them over the uh couple of weeks that you're away and uh
change the water every couple of months and buy in a few plants so
other than the fact that they keep dying uh fish are uh are not are are are reasonable pets in that uh they're low maintenance
great
right
okay uh if we're still all with us
right okay so
work has been done on uh
this uh project where by um twenty five euros is uh the uh expected uh selling price
mm-hmm
that information has come from our marketing manager here
yeah
so we're looking to sell internationally not just in europe
we're looking at um having our production costs limited to uh twelve and an half euro per unit
and therefore making a profit margin of uh well not actually a profit margin it's uh because obviously you're gonna have overheads and various other costs to uh take uh from uh
from that to give you your profit margin per unit
and so depending what the uh the overhead uh costs are will determine uh how many units we're uh looking to sell or projecting to sell at this point in time
so um
experience with remote control first ideas
new remote
so i guess we're looking at um having a discussion at this point in time to help uh you um folks design our our new model as it were
yes
so uh any any thoughts
um i with some remote controls the buttons were a little small so they're quite hard to press so maybe we make something with uh
easy to press buttons
as that is the main function
okay so so basically we're looking for some um we're looking for a device that is um robust and
yes
and therefore uh won't get damaged too easily
um we're looking for a device
that is uh what was the other things you said there
um sort of easy to use so the buttons are accessible
easy to use
use
is easy to use and see
and see
yes
okay
uh
can i just check
is this just a television remote
because a lot of um
systems are kind of t. v. video combined now or t. v. d. v. d. combined
and one of the most annoying things is having like five remotes in the house
mm-hmm
so if you've got a combined system it could be a combined remote
mm
or is it just a television that we're supposed to be doing
oh i w um basically i'll get back to you on that
but it seems to me sensible 'cause as you rightly said there's nothing more annoying than having three or four devices littered about the uh about the room
yeah
and uh
so a device for
for all remotes
sorry you go
i've
you go
okay
yeah
um one of the things um we found from the market research is that people often get confused by the number of buttons on them as well
'cause there's quite often lots and lots
and um sometimes uh they sort of remote controls defeat their own purpose because you're sat in the chair and the remote is somewhere else in the room
so whereas in the past you'd have to get up to change the channel now you have to get up to sort of pick up the remote
so so i don't we need to sort of maybe think about how um we could maybe uh develop a remote control which moves around the room
comes to your whistle
i don't know
hmm
that's that's maybe something for the future when you can talk to your television but
yeah
but is it in a sense it's r um mutually exclusive
you can't have both the th the one device and then have few buttons on it to 'cause you want you want simplicity as well
yeah
you want any idiot to be able to use it
yeah
whilst at the same time you want as you rightly said one remote for all
mm-hmm
and so these are probably mutually exclusive options that uh hmm you could argue that experience of using devices and similar devices as people get more and more used to using remotes
yes
mm-hmm
therefore they're more with handling them therefore you can make them more complicated as time goes on
yeah
maybe we could um have better instructions with the remote
or are we just doing the design of the remote control itself or sort of the instructions that would come with it
better instructions
yeah
i mean
we've done some research um about sort of you know what the cutting edge sort of hand held devices are
and a lot of them sort of use you know they're like they're like mini laptops
mm-hmm
so it's possible that we could devise a system where where you're you're basically sort of holding a a miniature computer which is controlling all your your sort of your television
your stereo and where you know if you buy a new thing then it sort of you can link it to that as well maybe
okay
um well we've got five minutes before the end of the meeting
so uh we have to uh start winding up
um is there next meeting in thirty minutes
'kay
okay
so um
right so we've got i. d. the come on where's my
if you just click return it should be okay
it'll get rid of the message
or not
if you hit just hit return and it should get rid of the message
oh there we go
oh you've got
yeah
that's what i was looking for
right
so we've got function
oh what happened to the
i think that might be back to the start
yeah
um if you grab the kind of uh slide to the left and pull it down
slide four
yeah
right
right
okay
sorry about that
okay so we've got um the working design
for i. d.
for u. i. d. the technical functions design
marketing the user requirement specification
specific instructions will be sent to you by your person by your personal coach
so
are we all clear what objectives we're looking to meet in the next thirty minutes
mm-hmm
and i guess i'll try and write up some minutes of uh this meeting to uh to give it to you for the next meeting
yes
'kay yes
mm-hmm
i'm not exactly clear on what we're designing the rem remote for
is this a mun multi functional one or do we decide that ourselves as we go away and work on it
i think you just said at the start it was a television remote control so maybe we should just stick to that unless we get told otherwise
television remote control
right
that's true 'cause during during the course of our day we might make decisions based on information or meetings that would change where we're going
okay cool
but at this point in time i think you're right that uh shall we make it just a t. v.
okay
'kay
so we will depart
we will stay here and uh and break off
and i'll do minutes and and we'll see you in half and hour
okay that's great
okay
okay cheers
okay
right s
right uh
so um
so where's the powerpoint presentation
sorry
microsoft powerpoint right
right okay
so
right
okay so we've got uh
so we've got new project requirements
um
so basically we've got three things and we've got forty minutes in which to uh for this meeting to uh to discuss the various options
um
three presentations
we have a i guess we have a presentation each 'cause i've got one
um
yeah
yeah i've got one too
i see right
that's nice to know one from each of you
um new project requirements
um so do we want to do the presentation first or do we want to um
w i i got um or or three things basically um relating to the remote being only for t. v.
we discussed that last time and in actual fact that was pr pretty well what we came up with anyway
mm-hmm
mm-hmm
so in fact it actually f we won't be forestalled in a sense
mm-hmm
um we've got uh teletext outdated
um did you get any information on that
uh we didn't no
no
right and the corporate image was the uh final thing
i d i didn't personally
hmm
so i i got that in email form
um
right okay
so
i guess if we go ahead with the uh with the three presentations
so we'll start with yourself on the basis that uh
okay that's fine
i'll just um i'll grab the wire out the back of this one
sorry yep
oh
what is it
i'm not quite sure how it
i think you've got to do um control f. eight
control
doesn't seem to be quite working at the moment
shift f. eight
alt function f. eight
again not doing anything
there's usually a little thing in the top right for the oh hang on it's just coming on
oh
ah there it's doing something
pressed about five times now
okay that's me
okay um i have to go again
it going
hopefully that should be it this time
okay i think we're there
that's good
okay um
okay i'm gonna be looking at the working design
um of the of the remote control
um i've just got three sections first is the research i made on the on the remote control itself um
and then that involves the components required in it and the systems uh design of the actual the actual remote
um so having researched the existing models within the market um i found my research off the internet
um i've established what the components required for the remote control to function actually are
and then also the methods in which these components interact together for the remote to actually do what you want it to do and how it connects with the television
um the basic components are an energy source which i guess um in most existing models would be a battery supply
whether that'll be sort of two batteries four batteries um it may vary
we then have the user interface which is basically the like the the buttons on the actual remote
okay
um the various functions used for changing channel uh channel up and down volume things like that
um there's also a chip inside the remote which does all the computer type things
and then the sender which um
is usually i've found an infra red device which sends a signal to the actual television
um and the last part is receiver which is important in the system but is not actually part of the remote itself because that's obviously found in the television
um i'm gonna have to actually draw on the board because uh it was a little tricky on powerpoint to get this working so
i'll just go through there
s um um do we have a cloth to wipe this down with or
oh i'll j
i think it's that little
uh there's the rubber on the right i think
oh i see
oh okay
i'll get rid of the bear
it's magic
okay that's great
okay so we start off with a um battery suppl uh no a power supply which we'd probably get it's probably gonna be the battery
um
we then have
a particular button which may be that's obviously there's lots and lots of different buttons
um but this is how the basic system works
um that sends after you press that that sends the message to
the chip which um then sends
it sort of interprets which button you've pressed and then sends the appropriate message to the sender
um
so that's
that's the remote in itself that's the components of the remote and how they work together
so this is the uh user
interface
um this is the chip itself which then and that's the that's the infra red
sender
and then on the separate thing we have on the
on the television
we have a
a receiver
and the sender sends a message to the receiver
'kay
so the the top bit's the power source yes
ah yes that's the power source
um
going on to personal preferences i've said that battery seems the best option for the actual remote just because of the size
you don't want a a cable attached to the remote otherwise it's not it's not really a remote
um and then the sender and infra red um has been used quite successfully
if the battery's on reasonable power they always seem to work fairly well
you don't have to be point directly at the television itself
so the battery is the in the sender
um
yes
'kay and that's it for the moment
okay
okay
so now more design
right
thank you
mine's not quite as complicated as all that
that's what we like to hear
did i press function
yeah
is it control function ei oh th there you go
oh
um
okay so i'm gonna talk a bit about the technical functions design
i'm louisa the user interface designer as you know
um so the m basic method of this is to send a signal from the remote to the television set so that a desired function is performed
um an example of the function could be to change the volume up or down uh so obviously you need two different buttons for that
um to change the channel either by pressing the number that you want or by channel up or down
um to switch the television on or off maybe a standby button
um here are two example remotes
um by the look of it they both have um kind of play and fast forward rewind functions
so i think they incorporate a kind of video function which we won't have to worry about
uh but as you can see the left remote is quite um quite busy looking quite complicated
um whereas the right remote is much simpler it looks much more user friendly
um so my personal preference would be the right remote
so it's got nice big buttons it's got a very limited number of buttons
um they're nice kinda clearly labelled
um i like the use of the kind of um symbols like the triangles and the squares and the arrows as well as the words on the um kind of play functions and all that
so it's very very user friendly and it's got a little splash of colour
could maybe do with some more colour
um
well there's a couple of things there
um we have to remember that we have our own um logo and colour scheme
so basically we'd have to uh we'd have to be putting that on um the the product
hmm
do we get to see that
i haven't as yet no
will you be presenting that in a bit
but uh i got uh i got an email that basically said to uh make sure that uh whatever device we come up with at the end of the day had to incorporate um the corporate colour and slogan
so uh i'm guessing that uh uh i notice on the bottom there it's got uh
what's that
a. p. o. g. e. e. that might be the corporate colour scheme although the only the only colour i can see in that is the red
hmm
would you be able to get rid of the the extra buttons here
the the sort of circular section because that seems to be for a video as well
so we could dispense with that little bit as well and just get it down to just the numbers and the volume
what do you mean by the circular section
possibly
like all of that bottom bit
j yeah yeah yeah j yeah just this little bit is that i think that's still um a video remote part
yeah
so maybe we could get rid of that as well
yeah
and i don't really think that you need nine numbers
well b uh w
i mean how often do you use seven eight and nine
i think just one to six and then channel up and down should be enough
well th the on the well uh for for general television purposes obviously you have channels one to five at this point in time
like how often do you hit nine
mm-hmm
and we'd have to have some room for uh future such channels
it's just people are used to seeing that so if we didn't have them then they might think it's
but but
but well possibly but the the other thing is that with um the current expansion of uh channels uh in the process of taking place
certainly the button up and down but uh i mean how many channels do we have to um actual television channels do we have to uh prepare for
i would have thought that uh
it's forever expanding and at the moment we've got although you've onl you've got the five standard
you've got the b. b. c. have come up with a further six and uh there's uh i don't know exactly how many channels there are on uh when you take into account uh sky and various other um various others
mm-hmm
hmm
so i would've thought that we wouldn't you know rather okay
hmm
if the time of flicking from one to other but presumably it'll take a second 'cause you have to be able to stop it
maybe you could have a fast forward on the on the channels that w and then you could dispense with more otherwise
y you'd want you'd want to get fairly quickly to the channel that you wanted
um some remotes have kind of favourite options where if you always flick from channel one to channel six
um if that's a favourite you just like by pass two to five
mm-hmm
yeah
i s i suppose in a sense you could have um if you've got a hundred channels then if you had sort of an easy way of getting rather than having to go one to a hundred
you could go one to one to ten
ten to twenty and then have a second button to get you to the actual channel you want and that would cut down your time
hmm
mm-hmm
mm
um
anyway
but i think a lot of um like cable and sky and stuff that would be tuned to one channel
and then you'd have another remote for all of those channels
like to get to fifty five and the higher numbers
okay yeah
whatever
yeah
okay
okay
limit the number of buttons user friendly
but i suppose nine's not really excessive
i suppose with nine you've got the the like the last one which makes the tenth means you uh it's like uh multiples you can put them together so you can make any number
i suppose it does make a good pattern
so with that we'd kind of by pass any problems with
yeah
well that's true yeah you could get fifty by five and a zero or whatever that that makes sense
yeah
yeah
'cause that facilitates having all the numbers you could ever need
yeah
um
mm-hmm
does
okay
so w so what was the circular thing that you were
um i think that's just for a video so we wouldn't need any of that at all
so we could get it down to what
if it's just for t. v. which is what it is at the moment
mm-hmm
so we get to how many buttons have we got
we've just got ten eleven twelve th we got fourteen that we need
i guess
mm-hmm
um which isn't really too many
that'll be quite easy to make a user guide for a fourteen button remote
mm-hmm
well we've we've got um that it's remote for t. v. only otherwise project would become too complex with uh which would endanger the time to market was one of the considerations
'kay
i'm i don't know d did you have that information behind the marketing or was i meant to give you that information
mm-hmm
um
i'm not sure
i had i've had some market information but not from the company no
right
right okay so basically time to market seems to be important therefore speed of delivery
'kay
we've only got about another four hours left
okay so is everyone happy with that
ah yes yes that seems good
okay
right well that's the end of my presentation
'kay
i'm gonna pull this off
i think if you just give it a second to maybe catch up
yeah i think she said twenty seconds to um
uh-huh
okay
i'm sure we'll have by the end of today
i'll give it another go
yeah there we go
right we've done some research into the functional requirements that people want out of their remote control
and first off we should state that th the remote control's for controlling the t. v.
and um how do people use it
we asked them sort of which buttons were useful for them
um how d how does a remote control look and feel for them and what improvements would would they like to remote control
and we did that by sort of giving them a questionnaire that we'd prepared and asking them to fill in the answers
and three quarters of them found that remote controls are ugly and that a sort of even higher proportion would spend more for a sort of s uh a fancier remote control
and that of all the buttons on the remote control
the sort of setting buttons for sort of the picture picture and brightness and the audio settings um they weren't used very often at all
people concentrated on the channel buttons and the volume buttons and the power buttons
uh we also asked them about speech recognition uh for remote control
and young people were quite receptive to this
but as soon as we got sort of over about into a thirty five to forty age forty five age group and older
people people weren't quite so keen on speech recognition
there's a lot more th there's a lot lot more older people who didn't know whether they wanted it or not as well
um we also asked what frustrated people about remote controls and the number one frustration was that the remote was lost somewhere else in the room and that they couldn't find it
and the second second biggest frustration what that if they got a new remote control
it was difficult to learn um all the buttons and all the functions and to find your way around it
okay so
my personal preferences from the marketing is that we need to come up with some sort of sleek sort of good looking high high tech a design which looks high tech
basically
um and that we should come up with fewer buttons than most of the controls on the market
and we should sort of concentrate on the channels and sort of power and also volume and that sort of thing as as louisa said
um we could maybe come up with a menu a sort of a an l. c. d. menu for other functions on the remote control
that's worth thinking about
um and maybe we could think about speech recognition as well because um sort of young people are
perhaps the ones that are gonna buy buy our new product if we aim it at sort of you know sort of a high tech design
that that might be the market that we're we're looking for
and we could maybe think about using speech recogniti recognition as a way to find the remote control if it's lost in a room
rather than sort of um having it to speech recognition to change the channels
'cause there's a problem with that in that the television makes noise so it could end up talking to itself and changing its channel
mm
okay um and that's the end of the slide show
that's it
cool
do a lot of um
what was that last wee bit there
um about speech recognition
speech recognition right okay
yeah
but that was only for young people that preferred it older people didn't
youn young people pref yeah
they s they said that they'd be interested in a remote control which offered that possibility and as you go up through the age groups
people got less and less interested in sort of a a remote control that you could talk to so
no what i maybe think is um
it seems the technology would be quite advanced for that and they might end up costing more than our twelve fifty budget for
yeah
well that's right
for the speech recognition
yeah
yeah
um
and possibly the thing about the about the remote being lost we could have you know with your mobile phone you lose that and you can ring it
maybe we can have some kind of sensor which is kept somewhere where you can some kind of buzzer system between the two
yeah
so you can press a button which is always kept in one place and then it maybe buzzes to somewhere else wherever the remote actually is
uh-huh
yeah
yeah we'd have t that would mean we'd have to put two products together as well which which again would probably be a bit expensive but
that is true yes
hmm
there's key rings um that you kind of whistle at or clap at i can't remember and then they whistle back or something like that
yeah
sounds reasonable
yeah
that'd probably be really simple they're cheap
mm-hmm
mm-hmm
yeah
so i guess it'd be something we could like attach to the or like the same technology could be put inside the
so
well if you're trying to avoid having a second product 'cause obviously you could have a second product that gave you the right pitch which would set the remote off to say here i am sort of thing
inside the remote
you know without sound recognition
but if you
i know
um i was gonna say a sharp noise you know a clapping of hand or whatever
you'd want to try and av just have the one product that if
yeah
yeah if we if we could have it in the actual remote like everything in one one device
mm-hmm
yeah
yeah
um i dunno um talking about vo i mean obviously if you've got voice recognition then you can do it in that way because it'll recognise the voice and you can give it a command
a set command whatever that happened to be
yeah
but you've then got the point if if you're not going with uh voice recognition then
you could have an option to turn it off
mm-hmm
or
perhaps um
yeah
so that would solve the problems with the t. v. kind of speaking to the remote and changing its own channels
mm
so uh any sugges well any conclusions
um would it take quite a while to sort of develop the speech recognition software in the remote control
mm
considering
well if it does then we can't
yeah
it's that simple because we've got uh th th three um primary um uh requisites from uh
from and email uh that was sent to me whereby we had the design logo was one which we've already mentioned
we've got um the remote was only for the television and not for because that would make it too complex and we have to get it market quickly
mm-hmm
and the uh third thing was that um teletext uh as far as uh the management is concerned
um is becoming dated uh due to the popularity of the internet
okay
so that means that uh so these are the sort of three um extra parameters that have been put on this uh project
'kay
mm-hmm
so we're being focused effectively directly at a television and it seems to me that the management is uh wanting us to go down a narrow path and not opening out
yes
so anything that uh is to be added
such as voice recognition et cetera has to be very simple and has to be very quick because time to market is is critical
has to be simple enough to
i suppose if we could get something in which was quite quick and simple that would give us an advantage over the other remotes
mm-hmm
s
it would
um
but probably quick and simple is primary rather than
'kay
added extras
added extras would be nice but the primary consideration is to get the project finished within uh this short time window
mm-hmm
which effectively now is sort of four hours
so and if and we've gotta get to the end
uh d d i think i think first and foremost we've gotta get to the end and then get to the end with um added extras if possible
mm-hmm
mm-hmm
okay
so
right okay uh so i need to
right
so i don't know how long we have left of our uh time
but we have to make the decisions on uh the remote control functions
about five minutes
and how we were planning to proceed so that at the next uh meeting
each person that's got a a a task to do is clear from this meeting what that task is
yes
mm-hmm
um
we'll also know w when the next meeting is i um so we'll know how long we've got to complete that task
and then we can report back at the next meeting and say right okay yes
we've achieved this or we haven't achieved this this is how far we've progressed
does that make reasonable sense
mm-hmm
yes that seems right
yeah
okay yeah
so we have to come effectively to the decision on the remote functions so that you can decide what you're gonna be doing
and if dur between the time of this meeting finishing and the next meeting starting
if you get any additional information that uh only you have at that point in time you'd think would be relevant to other people in terms of their des decision making um process
mm-hmm
then we should communicate that as quickly as possible and not wait until the next meeting
mm-hmm
do it via the email so that rather than coming you know if you get the information just before the next meeting that's fine
okay
yep
come along with it in the next meeting we can discuss it then and take whatever action is appropriate
okay
but if you get it well before the next meeting
let everybody else know 'cause that might have an impact on their uh on what they come up with effectively at the next meeting
yeah
okay
mm-hmm
right is there
so do we need to decide on the functions now
s
i would guess so
well i think it'd be really easy and it'd be a big advantage if we did have some sort of um kind of whistle back kind of function
mm-hmm
yeah and
'cause that'll solve kind of the frustration of losing it
yeah and that was that was the number one sort of frustration that people said so
yep
i don't think there's anything else on the market that does that so
yeah
i don't really know about the voice recognition thing
i w well uh i
maybe we should concentrate just on the whistle back function at the moment and if something comes back
something simple
uh if if our primary consideration is to get it there in time time's short
you want something to meet the major concerns of the consumer so that we can have that as a selling point for the product something that's quick and simple
mm-hmm
mm-hmm
yeah
so sounds good
and that wouldn't put off the kind of older generation either
'cause everyone can whistle or clap and they wouldn't have to be kind of scared of this new technology
well so maybe a clap rather than a whistle would be on the basis that if we've got if we're catering to the whole age range
mm-hmm
you want something that's easy to do now something that doesn't like whis uh well i i i don't know
no not everyone can whistle can they though
well if you think that more people can whistle than clap then that's fine then go for that option
but if i would have thought that more people could clap rather than whistle so uh so clap option
no clapping i think clapping yeah
i'd go more yeah f more for clap
yeah
yeah
okay
'kay we've already decided that we don't need a teletext button haven't we
uh
is that one of the
ef effectively that's what the that's what they're saying that uh if uh if people are now using the internet then you don't need teletext
hmm
taking out teletext okay
so so take out teletext
did we decide on having the ten um the ten numbers and then the the little digit next to it which kind of enabled you to put them together
right
yeah i think so so zero to nine
mm
i think nowadays you can just get ones where it gives you a sort of a second or two to press another number
yeah
so you can press any two and it'll sort of put them together
okay ten numbers and then some kind of device to allow uh
yeah
i'll put delay to allow um multiple numbers
yeah
or multiple digits
yeah
did we decide anything about um the other functions
as in setting the audio and tuning it and stuff like that
you had an had an idea about the menu
uh we could possibly put an l. a sort of a l. c. d. menu in but that again is probably an expense that
but just thinking um people probably i mean you don't have you only have to probably tune in the t. v. once
but you have to be able to tune it that once
yeah
so and if finally the t. v. breaks you get a new one you're gonna have to be able to tune it
you can't really avoid that
mm-hmm
hmm
no
except the new digital markets which do it by themselves
yeah
so that'll be in
but the but that's relying on the television market changing to an automatic and if it is at the moment that's fine
yes
but at the moment it's not so it seems to me that you have to have a device that caters
'cause otherwise it would make it uh your device would become inoperable
yeah
yeah
or only operable in certain circumstances and the idea is to have an international market which is and it's also m it's the the product we've got is something that's at the i would have said the lower end of the s of the cost scale
yeah yeah
mm
yeah
so we're not really going for something that's uh
yeah
i s i suppose um
terribly high tech
if people are buying remotes then they're probably buying it to replace another remote 'cause all most tellies come with remotes so
possibly
i mean we're maybe talking about replacing remotes for slightly older televisions so we maybe need to keep the the tuning function in
that's right
yeah
yeah
so how would this menu function work
would you maybe have like one menu button then you'd use the other buttons maybe the number buttons to actually do the separate functions
yeah that would be a good idea yeah
yeah like the volume or something
okay
yeah 'cause you do need um kind of brightness and contrast and everything as well
my dad was watching a film the other week and it was too dark so i had to go through it and turn the brightness up
mm-hmm
we're gonna have the the individual numbers and then a menu function and maybe sort of a slightly more advanced um instruction booklet to come with it
hmm
to guide presu uh i think it'd be quite hard just for people to grasp um just off like the menu use different buttons you maybe have to have like some better instructions of how that would actually work
uh
i'm not sure whether the sort of having people have a booklet 'cause one the second most annoying thing that people found was having to learn the new one
right okay um
so maybe next to each of the buttons
you know each of them could have a number and then also a function written next to it so you're basically pressing
that also goes back to the original design when we saw those two
and there was the one on the left hand side which had all like the double functions and stuff which kind of looked too busy and had too much on it
right
so
okay
well if we're trying to keep it slee sleek and sexy as well
okay well
have you seen those remotes where kind of um the bottom bit slides down so there's kind of um everything else revealed
mm
yeah
so y ah that's a very good idea
so you don't use it that much you don't have to see it all the time
but it's all there if you need it
that is that is a good idea actually
yeah yeah
sor sort of a second
so you keep um right we've got five minutes before we wind up this meeting so i've been told
like a hidden panel
okay
i don't know if you've got the same
uh not quite but i guess
okay
so so keep um keep detailed functions um hidden at the back
keep the other buttons but hide them away
hmm
and that'll be better for the older generation as well 'cause well my dad doesn't like anything that you've got to kinda flick through a menu
ah
mm-hmm
but he can pretty much read a button if it's displayed properly
mm-hmm
so
yeah
so um we're gonna have to have to work out what's gonna be on these other functions as as well
so we're gonna have like two separate two separate lists i guess
yeah
that's right
yeah
data functions hidden at back
so th the
can bring out when needed
the detailed ones would be sort of brightness uh sorta
yeah
that's right so we're dis so you've got which ones are gonna be on the front and which ones are gonna be on the back
so sh
we have to decide
should we decide in the next couple of minutes and then
mm-hmm
yeah
i guess so
so on the
so on front
about the number
numbers
um the volume up and down
and the volume
volume
shall we have a mute button as well
um
sorry
a mute button as well
yeah
mm
yeah
yeah i think they're handy
or
mm-hmm
and probably a power one as well
dunno
i know it's probably like um
not an issue to raise here but um the whole thing about not using your standby uh because of the like waste of electricity
have you seen the adverts
like if you boil the kettle that's full that's a waste
mm-hmm
yeah
mm-hmm
if you leave your telly on standby it powers blackpool for a certain amount of time
like we should maybe try to discourage people from standby
but then they might not buy it if they haven't got one
'cause people might just be too fickle and not want to change
yeah
yeah it's maybe too much of a big issue for here
yeah
so so are you having the stand by on the front then
we can send out a flier with the device saying that you shouldn't leave it on stand by
uh oh danger sign
i think you probably should
yeah but a little bit smaller
okay
compromise
well
um are we gonna have the channel up and down as well as the number buttons
um 'cause yeah the market research said there is quite a lot of people do just zap around and flick so
okay so we'll have um
right
so we've got ten eleven twelve thirteen fourteen fifteen sixteen there
um
channel up and down
what else have we got
what was that sixteen
numbers is ten volume is
twelve th yeah si one up one down
volume button
how many volumes
right okay
on mute
and a mute yeah
that's sixteen isn't it yeah
is there anything else
um
i don't think so no
power button stand by channel up and down
so is that it
so
okay
that's sixteen buttons you reckon
and then at the back
you've got
brightness and contrast
maybe if we're gonna run out of time
and then
one of us should come up with a list of these and then get back at the next meeting just at the start and say what they're gonna be
okay
yeah
so on the back
mm-hmm
it'll have brightness contrast anything else
uh there's audio functions
you're also gonna have the channel tuner as it were
yeah
so tuner up and down i guess
yeah
tuner would that have up and down
um up tune one way tune the o i i dunno i dunno possibly
i think they normally do
okay
yeah
yeah
okay
and then maybe sort of an enter button for
sort of s you know saying that you want that particular thing tuned in
so you go up and down and then it pick it finds something and then you wanna press enter to select it yeah
oh yeah and th and a enter button just to select
yeah okay
um i guess we're keeping s it simple
we don't really need any other audio funct uh functions because it's just volume up volume down
um up volume yeah i would have thought so
um
yeah
so i think um
there's quite a lot of like dolby surround studio surround sort of things
yeah
okay
do they have their own do they have their own controls on their actual products then or do you have to do it via the remote
um maybe for the younger market
um i think they've got their own controls in this kind of like hidden panel
yeah i suppose if we've got their if they've got their own controls then we can avoid it for ours just to keep it simple
yeah
yeah
oh no i mean um like there's kind of individual buttons for them like on the t. v. remote
oh okay
right
mm-hmm
but i don't really know what they're for i've never used them
um
i just know they're something to do with dolby
maybe unless something comes up then we should i think
well you might get some research
well shall we look into that and just get back together
okay
okay
right
right so i'll do the minutes of uh this meeting
right
and we'll meet back at i'm not sure
um forty minutes i believe is the time
'kay
okay
come on
okay
right
conceptual design meeting
right
okay so
right well um from the last meeting i was trying to send you the minutes
but uh it didn't work out too well so maybe in sort of um
quick summary of the last uh meeting i can
quickly give you
what we what we had
uh right so
wishing i hadn't closed the damn right so we had the fact that we're gonna have the the logo uh the company logo in its uh colour scheme incorporated onto the the device the remote device
we had uh made our decisions about uh
made our decisions about uh
the device itself that it was gonna be simple to make it uh
enable us to complete the project in time
we're gonna have uh effectively two pages a front page which had the uh features that the uh the customers most wanted
and then the uh the backup features on the second page so that it could uh
meet the technical requirements
and the customers wouldn't have to look at them too often only as and when required
so
so basically what decisions uh have we uh made
uh have there been any uh changes
i think we all have a presentation again so if we go through those and then um
right
yeah
three presentation yeah
shall i go first again
so yeah fine
okay
i see this a little more smoothly than the last one
okay right let's get started
um
basically the uh for the um i'll back actually
for the components design um next step is basically the the way the remote's gonna work is still the same idea as before
we still have the user interface which is all the buttons we're gonna incorporate
then there is a chip and still the sender
so um yes including the power s supply as well
um i'll go on to my findings in each of these areas
uh first in the power supply we have the option of just the standard battery
um
there's a dynamo
any of you think of kind of like the the old torches which you wind up um
there's a kinetic option which if any of you've seen those new watches which you kind of you power up by waving around
um it just requires a small amount of movement which would mean the batteries wouldn't have to be replaced
um that's one option but i think that was gonna cost a little more
mm-hmm
and then there's solar cells
um as a final option
for the buttons we have um an integrated push button which is oh just to say all all these are um supplied by real reaction
so i guess for the ease of for quickness and ease we should take them from at least like one of these options
um so for the buttons there's an integrated push button which i guess is just the same as the standard ones
okay
this says it's uh similar to uh the button on the mouse for a normal for like uh like modern computer
um there's a scroll wheel
which is you know the new mouse has just got like the centre section which you can scroll up and down which may be for the volume
you could do do that
mm-hmm
mm-hmm
um one issue for the buttons is depending on which material we use
if we use rubber buttons then it requires a rubber case so we have to take that into consideration
um moving on to the printed s
what would be the cost do do we know
um that's on the next i th i think the there wasn't too much difference in the cost
that that related to the actual buttons but it does affect the printed circuit board
um which is the next section
basically for the circuit board which is the middle it's just see it down there the chips like the like the workings of the actual um of the remote
mm-hmm
the firm supplies a simple a regular and an advanced um circuit board
and there's different prices according to each
so if we've got the scroll wheel for one of the buttons
that would require a slightly more advanced circuit board than if we just had a standard um push button
mm-hmm
um one final thing we came up with was some information on the speech recognition
there's a small unit available through the company um which obviously would be an extra cost but it wouldn't affect the size of the remote too much
um and i guess that would require a more advanced circuit board so there is an extra price in that sense
there is th sorry an extra cost in that sense
um going to my personal preferences
um i thought possibly for power we could use kinetic um which is the idea of the watches um that you move you move the remote around to power it up
and this would avoid batteries running out having to replace batteries and such like
um for the buttons i thought we'd probably get away with just having the standard um push buttons rather than the scroll wheel
um and for the circuit board again depends on which features we want in the actual in the remote
so if we wanted the scroll wheel and wanted the voice recognition um then we'd have to get a a more costly circuit board
and that's it
'kay
with the printed circuit boards you were going for the
thanks
um i it kind of depends um if we're gonna have the speech recognition we'd have to probably get an advanced one
i'm guessing
mm-hmm
uh but i don't know so that is something i'll have to look into
but are we going f r right
um that's a that's a decision for all of us
um
so are we able to make that decision now in a sense that this is the point at which we're discussing that issue
yeah yeah
we decide
mm-hmm
so would it not be best to rather than i mean one way is to do each of the presentations and then make decisions going back to the various presentations as they were
yeah
the other way would be to do the presentation and then make the decision at that point in time
mm-hmm
um
yeah that's probably a better one to discuss it straight away
maybe w
'cause at that point then you've got the details up there
so if we wanted to know for instance that the scroll wheel required the regular and what required advance
then if we were able to see that down then we could make the decision at that point in time and then that would be the end of that issue
um
does that make sense
yes
um i have a lot of the information there
mm-hmm
it might not be very clear
is there
unless you want to plug it back in to yours
um
we could do yeah
um yeah we should
as i say it only specified that we need a more advanced circuit board for the scroll wheel
it didn't the voice recognition came as a separate piece of information
mm-hmm
um
no the scroll wheel required the regular so the
yeah if if you down um
hmm
it's just this bit at the bottom which i've highlighted
but the scroll wheel requires a mini m minimally a regular chip which is in the higher price range
okay
i think the scroll wheel um
the display requires an advanced chip the display requires an advanced chip which in turn is more expense
also the display's for something else which we decided against
um but that bit
okay
and note that the push button just requires a simple chip so that would keep the price down
down
yeah and if we're going for sleek and sexy i think a scroll wheel is maybe a bit kinda bulky
mm-hmm
i i've got um pictures well i've seen pictures with it kind of sticking off the side of it and they don't really look great
right
'kay
okay
so maybe just a simple push button and that would cut costs on the
so
so we're going for p okay
so is um
so are we going for the w are we going for the simple one are we
yeah a simple pushbuttons
okay
simple push button
did everyone get this on the speech recognition
the um it was basically what we said before the idea that you record in a set
message and then it picks up that message um and replies to you
mm-hmm
yeah
so it is basically the concept we discussed before
um but then we don't know for sure whether it would require a more complicated circuit board
i'm guessing it would but got like the definite information
maybe we should go on what we're certain of rather than
so if we go for the simple push button so effectively we're going for the simple printed circuit board are we
or are we going for the regular
um if it's just the push button then it just needs the simple circuit board
mm mm
but is there any other i mean okay that's true for the for for that element but we have to take all el elements into consideration
and so if there is one element that requires the more expensive one
or say the regular one or the more advanced then that would have to be the same for all of them
mm
hmm
s
i suppose we need we need to find out what circuit board that requires maybe before we m make a decision
but
but the way that i interpret that um it doesn't seem to send out a signal to the telly
right
it just it's like a parrot just rep reply replying to your message
oh yeah i suppose so yeah
mm-hmm
so maybe that would be something separate yeah
so i don't think it would effect our circuit board
yeah
no
okay so we'd have a simple circuit board and that would be an extra that would be in addition to it
yeah
yeah
and i don't think you could really perform any of the remote functions with it
oh that makes sense
'cause the example that they've given there is good morning coffee machine good morning jo
mm mm
it might be useful to say like where are you remote
okay
here i am jo
yeah
but i think that's maybe as far as that one could go
okay
yeah
yeah that makes sense so we'd stick with the simple circuit board and then think of the speech recognition as an extra
an extra possibility
yeah just as a fun way to find it
simple circuit board
okay
um
simple push button
okay
w w kinetic
and it says that i think it said the cost of that isn't too much
you were you were wanting to go for the kinetic power supply
um yeah i i thought so just for just for ease of not having to replace the batteries
mm-hmm
mm-hmm
um
and how does it get uh charged up
it's um i think it works on the basis they have some kind of ball bearings inside
it's um it's some on watches which you you kind of you shake to power it up
somehow the mechanism inside powers up through movement
mm-hmm
okay
so you'd you'd move the remote around a little bit and then that powers it up to use it
okay
yeah
so the speech recognition was are we going for speech recognition
no
'cause that required the advanced
um i think it would be helpful to find it but i don't think it'd um
just
uh yeah i think did we decide it didn't affect the circuit board it just affected
yeah i think so
just just for the call and find thing
it was just
i had speech recognition requires advanced req require
oh no th that's what that's what i thought but maybe maybe it doesn't
um i think i might have got that wrong
oh
'cause it's s it's separate isn't it it's not part of the
so okay
speech recognition you reckon then is s simple
it's it's just an addition thing it's um yeah
and so we would want it in as an extra because it doesn't appear to cost too much
would that be
'kay
mm-hmm
mm-hmm
'kay shall i pass on to you now
i think
in fact it wouldn't really cost anymore would it
i'll just just check what it said
actually i don't think it really says anything about the cost but it says that it's already in the coffee machines so
yeah
like it's already kind of
i assume it would cost extra but
maybe we maybe we'll find out how much that does cost and have to decide slightly later
and then have to change all change everything at the last minute
okay
um
s
oh that was quick
um okay so very brief presentation um
from looking at the remotes that are out there at the minute none of them are particularly um sleek and sexy
um i haven't actually got the examples of the scroll button there um but there's some curved cases that you can see uh a range of sizes uh
all of them have a lot of buttons there um they seem to just have the rubber buttons
does that move it
sorry
it just seems to be skipping on without us doing anything
yeah i've found that try and get it back
if you right click and then go onto a previous slide
ah it's alright
um
okay right
there wasn't much more to say about that just rambling
um some of the uh remotes that i looked at one of the models da did actually have voice recognition where you could um
where it was connected to the remote control functions
and uh it was quite uh a swish model where it can control uh four devices t. v. cable satellite video d. v. d. audio
um so that's a bit of competition there
so
i mean maybe it's better not to try and compete with that sort of thing and just to market it as a completely different um
like different viewpoint as a kind of finding your lost control rather than trying to compete with the functions
yeah yeah
um the scroll buttons as you've already mentioned um
there's examples of those but they don't look as sleek as other models
and there's no real advantage and because it impacts on other on the materials and the price it's not great
on the price yeah
so you were saying the scroll buttons
um
yeah
th there was a specialist type of remote that we could think about um
there was children's remote
where um they just had a very limited range of buttons and they were b uh bright and colourful and um you you could program them so that they could only look at certain channels
'kay
mm-hmm
um but i don't know if that's really in our field
but that's something that's out there
i guess i guess we're going for the biggest market maybe not but
was it was it specified that we went for the biggest
well we're to go for the international market rather than a local market but that that wouldn't necessarily preclude the one thing that you can often do with products is you can uh make small modifications
hmm
so you have your basic model which you would sell at whatever
and then you could have additional features in you know like a you'd have model one
model two and model three and therefore you can sub divide your market up
but that's really where your field is
mm-hmm
so maybe the children's remote should be like a a next step but maybe i dunno for ours maybe we should
anyway you could add on for an extra package
but on this basic one i'm reckoning that we're going for the basic model to be discussed here and that uh you would have for future reference the possibility of adding in extra features at extra cost to take care of specialist market segments
hmm
mm-hmm
mm-hmm
okay
right well that's something that we can be aware of
is that so so what are we deciding to do here
um
i think because there's already um very good voice recognition technology out there
right
and because ours might not cover the same functions that the leading brands do it might be a good idea to market it as a um finder function
mm-hmm
uh the fi yeah the finder function rather than as a speech function to find your remote
yeah
yeah
so you also said for going for the international market um that some some maybe older people might not like the speech recognition
okay
oh yeah
s s so um
different languages might not be compatible
yeah yeah
it w it would make it quite complicated where um ours at least keeps it fairly simple and then the
hmm
hmm
mm-hmm
yeah 'cause i think you program um this one yourself like to say like whatever you want to your question
yeah yeah
yeah and ours is quite a cheap device so i don't know how much we'll be able to put into it
yeah
yeah
so you'd have a finder feature rather than a voice recognition feature
hmm
maybe unless something else comes up
and you were talking
mm
and you were talking about scroll buttons
um yeah i think um i think we've decided that it's gonna increase the cost and give no real kinda extra benefit and it's gonna decrease from the sleekness of it
okay
yeah
b
alright so we're just gonna have the the rubber buttons was that right
yes yes
hmm um and just to be aware that there are kind of specialist functions and specialist remotes but we probably don't want to focus on those like such as the children's remote
okay
so not to be focused on
yeah
um there was a mention just as kind of a warning about button design
um just to avoid ambiguity
so it gave the example of say your volume buttons for up and down they might both have a v. on for volume
um let's think how they did this
good in in flip it round in ninety degree a hundred and eighty degrees and have it up and down
i'm just gonna check so i do this right
an upside down v.
um
so that would show that volume was going up whereas the one underneath would see the volume going down
what did they say
um i think the thing was that if you decide to do this to have triangular buttons
um somebody might look at this one and say oh well this triangular button is pointing up and that's the first thing that they see
actually that can't be right can it
right
oh well no they might see
yeah they might see this pointing down and think right that's gonna turn the volume down
mm-hmm
whereas the actual button's pointing up so the function is to turn the button up
mm-hmm
so be careful what you put on the buttons and be careful of the shape that you make them because they might be kind of two um
so maybe we could have like
mm-hmm
yeah
contradicting kind of shapes
yeah i i know what you mean
so maybe we could have volume written on the side and then up and down on the on the buttons themselves
yeah
yeah
you could have volume up and volume volume up down and like that
possible
mm
and 'cause the idea was to have limited um it was to have sizable amount of information on it
yeah yeah
limited number of buttons
yeah
'cause it was sixteen buttons wasn't it that were
yeah we got it down to not too many
mm-hmm
um and i think that's all i had to say for that
okay
um so what was the decision on the um design of the volume button
um
are we are we gonna go through the design of all the buttons at the moment or are we gonna t
i've i've got some things to say about possible design things from
yeah maybe we should see yours first
oh okay
okay
trend watching
cool
right um i've been looking at some trends
in in sort of basically fashion on top of doing the um research into the remote control market the the one that's the one i talked about last time
that we'd sort of asked people about remote controls and what what was good about them what was bad what they used
and we've also been looking at sort of fa sort of fashions and what people are wanting out of consumer goods at the moment
so we've had people in paris and milan watching the uh fashion trends
you know yourself
so
so just to summarise the most important things which came out of the remote control market investigation
the most important thing was that the thing sort of look and felt fancy rather than just functional
'kay
and second there should be some technological innovation
and then third and l less important than the other two there should be an ease of use as well
and apparently the fashion trends are that people want sort of clothes and shoes and things with a fruit and vegetables theme
um but um the feel of the material should be spongy which is contrary to last year apparently
i presume it must have been not not spongy last year
so
we need to emphasise the fancy design with on on our remote control above all else
and then also try and add in technological informat innovation which could be our sort of find the thing with a hand clap
and then we need to ma sort of make it easy to use that's as a third priority
so perhaps um fewer fewer buttons and functions as we've as we've discussed
and then maybe find a way to incorporate these trends so that we sort of capture people's imaginations
so maybe we could make the buttons shaped like fruit and veg or the the buttons could be spongy uh somehow
maybe we could make them out of rubber rather than sort of hard plastic
and then sort of even wackier than that we could maybe have a fruit or vegetable shaped remote
say in the shape of a banana or something like that
right so that'll be it
maybe a banana or courgette or something
how how far we actually want to go along and sort of follow the trends
do we think the trends are particularly important for this type of gadget or or you know do they not matter that much
i think if you start making the buttons fruit shaped it might make it more complicated to use
well you were just talking about you've got to be careful how you shape your buttons 'cause you're can mis direct people
and i would've thought the functionality 'cause the people get cheesed off by things by having to read instructions et cetera so
yeah
yeah
maybe just one button say the standby button is quite kinda separate from all the other functions
maybe that could be a little apple
maybe yeah
and then that wouldn't get in the way of like kinda one to nine and it wouldn't confuse the numbers
okay
now
yeah
stand by button
no th that that incorporates the trend whilst at the same time not confusing people if you're looking for functionality
mm-hmm
well i dunno i i guess maybe fruit and vegetables may be popular at the moment but as we know how fickle the fashion markets are maybe
but what are they gonna be next yeah
what are they gonna be next year
yeah yeah
hmm
but but th but okay but you you can incorporate the tr if y if you change all the buttons then you've got the problem that this year's fruit and veg
s
mm-hmm
next year's uh i was gonna say animals or elephants or w whatever
yeah i'm not
that means you're constantly changing your production schedule and you've gotta make different moulds and everything else so that's not a good idea i would i would suggest
yeah
i'm not i'm not sure what what what the sort of timescale we're thinking of selling the product over is
i don't know
i mean it just seems realistic that the remote control market isn't the kind of thing which takes in
those kinds of fashion trends
yeah yeah
to something which is maybe more universal
mm-hmm
well
but i suppose as long as it's quite a subtle design um even if the design kind of changes
mm-hmm
we c maybe can imply a fruit shape possibly
mm-hmm
ah d d but if mm-hmm
maybe the spongy feel is something we could think about um
well
yep
maybe still with a rubber design we could
was that in the sort of fashion sense that this or was the spongy feel was that uh sort of fashion
it was wasn't it
yeah
it seems like you're gonna have rubber cases as well as buttons
so the
yeah
yeah
um
and that you can make them curved or double curved and that would be the kind of sleek and sexy look
oh yeah yeah one of the things were if you had rubber buttons then you had to have a rubber case
mm-hmm
oh right that fits doesn't it
um oh no no no sorry it's if you use the uh rubber double curved case then you must use rubber buttons
that's the way round
if you have the rubber case then you have to have the rubber buttons to go with it
which makes sense
right
um
rubber buttons require rubber case
and that would fit in with what we want wouldn't it for the spongy feel to have everything rubber
mm-hmm
uh so yeah
the m the main problem is how f how frequently do the fashions change
'cause in essence in the production you want things to stay you want to basically mint them out 'cause if you've got fashion changes and that you're incorporating
mm-hmm
then it means that your stock is um is last year's stock and therefore you're selling it or having to sell it at a discounted rate which you wouldn't want to do
mm-hmm
yeah
whereas if you kept the product the same but you could have a difference from year to year
uh it seems to me that you could incorporate a fashion statement if you like rather than changing the whole kit and caboodle
okay
yeah
yeah
you're just changing one aspect like like the standby button or something like that and especially 'cause then you could make it something that
i suppose we maybe are limited in the fact that we still have to put the logo on the actual would or not
mm-hmm
well you might be limited in space that yes
yeah
mm-hmm
well you two are obviously gonna find that out fairly quickly when you move over to your kit modelling stage as to uh how much pl how much how much how pliable is plasticine
hmm
yes yes
maybe we could think of the the cases like changing with the fashions like the nokia phones where you could take the casing off the outside
but whether that would be too much to incorporate in production whether that would just increase the costs make it more complicated
mm-hmm
hmm
that's possibly it
so you're talking there about uh changing
changing the casing
yeah the a the actual the sort of the look from the outside so where the buttons would stay the same
and the general function of the remote would stay the same but you could change the the way it looked
mm-hmm
yeah and then you could have oh but you still would have to have the logo on every new case
yeah that's true
but you could have like pink cases for girls and red ones and things like that
yeah you you could do a colour change
so therefore you would yeah yeah i mean that's effectively what they did with the with the mobile phones was to have some in blue
yeah
some in red some in rather than all in black or you know which four do you want as long as it's black
mm-hmm
hmm
but uh so
so it is a possibility um
but we are supposed to use the um company colour scheme aren't we
we haven't really seen that yet
yes oh that's true uh that might no
oh okay yes that is
yeah
it might and we might be able to do both but it might clash with certain things
well not necessarily because you could have your company uh we're we're meant to be finishing up
you could have your company badge and logo
i mean a lot of um computers for instance like like on the one you've got there
mm-hmm
it actually has a sort of um stick on badge so what you would al all you would really need
whether it you know whether the casing be w any colour could be any colour
but that badge would then have to stick out on top of it so that uh in a sense
mm-hmm
with a with a logo like that because it's on a white background
the only colour that it might not stick out so well on would be a white casing
'cause you you know you're sort of you're badging it
mm-hmm
and in fact a lot of companies get somebody else to make them and literally just badge them themselves with their own uh badge over the top
mm-hmm
mm-hmm
and in fact the way they've got that there even if you had that on a white which is the predominant colour of the uh the windows badge
you'd still be able to see it clearly from you know a white casing uh product
mm-hmm
yeah
so
hmm
and whether we'd have a big enough market to have this kind of like secondary market of selling the cases
might be something to consider
mm-hmm
well if it's for young people um like the phone generation
yeah
that sort of thing'd probably go down well and the market research has been on that side of things hasn't it
yeah
yeah i mean it's people say that it's the look they want the fancy looking thing but i'm
yeah
i'm not convinced on whether having changeable covers would be something that people would buy into
i think with the mobiles
it's the you know it's a communication device people see you with it all about and
yeah i suppose where you you keep the remote hidden under the sofa most of the time
i if it
it's uh in in the house isn't it i suppose
yeah
i think
okay so if we just went for one colour of a rubber case
so don't change case
mm-hmm
change case colour
and we're sort of saying no to that
did we decide on the rubber case
the spongy feel or did we think that that might go as a trend
well it was different last year
the trend was different last year apparently
it was not not spongy feel
but
i don't know whether the trend will change
i don't know whether it's one of those things that
like sort of having all fruit shaped keys that that probably would go out of fashion very quickly
whereas just the fact that it was a rubber case is probably less less of something that
yeah
yeah less likely to
sounds reasonable
y you're gonna end up hating in a year you know
if you're going for fashion trends like that they'll need t you'd have to have interchangeable cases so that you could or 'cause otherwise someone's gonna have to buy a complete new remote rather than just a case
so then th th that would
yeah
yeah
mm
it seems to make sense that we we'd just maybe stick with the standard rubber case and then have the standard rubber buttons as well
okay
okay
um
uh we haven't really talked about uh the curvature of the case
there's flat there's single curved and there's double curved
um
i'm not exactly sure what these things look like
mayb
maybe curves give it like the slightly more aesthetic feel
but the double curve wouldn't require us to perform miracles with the plasticine
well it says that
when you say d when you say double curved what what exactly does that mean
i'm not exactly sure
okay
um i'll show you
the remotes that i've got
see how uh
let's just get that bigger
see how uh the one oh i'm not plugged in am i
no you're not connected to me anymore
that doesn't help
one one thing to cons one thing to consider is that in some ways you want um by having a fairly standard case it means they can all fit together on top of each other therefore for storage purposes in shops and the like and it makes it easier that you can if you can store them up on top of each other
shall i just turn it round for time
that should come up
mm
mm-hmm
whereas if you do um fancy things with it you then gotta put it in a ca a a packaging box that that does that
and the cost of packaging could be quite important vis a vis the total cost of the product
yeah yeah
mm-hmm
hmm
so shall we go through quickly and just work out what we've decide on if we have to kind of
so but
yeah
um it's not very clear up there but you can see some of them have got kind of bulges
no
like the second one and the end one uh where there's a curve there
mm yep
right
i'm not exactl i don't know if a double curve is maybe it comes up slightly or
that's what i was trying to work out
but um it is a kinda sleeker look if you've got curves in there
oh right
shall we
s so do you wanna go for curves more curves
we're meant to be f we're meant to be finishing this meeting in about a minute or so
definitely a single maybe a double
yeah
'kay so shall we quickly
shall we go for single curve just to compromise
we'll go for single curve yeah
okay
okay curved or double curved
single curve
so it's single curved
so did we did we decide on the kinetic power supply
the one you move around
yeah i think that think that's a good idea
yeah
yep
okay
um
and the rubber push buttons rubber case
rubber
rubber buttons and case
um and we don't really know much about the colour scheme or logo yet do we but possibly a sticker
oh we ca yeah yeah we'll still have the are we gonna go for the simple circuit board just to keep the cost down
i th i think we can by by not having anything too complicated
yeah
yeah
um
yeah and and the voice recognition we can use that can't we just to find it
yeah yeah
um
without affecting the circuit board
yes
yep
and see we could always decide against it if something comes up that's just something to that we seemed to leave out
okay
and then are we going for sort of one button shaped like a fruit
yeah that sounds like it wouldn't do too much harm in a couple of years
or veg
uh what sort of shape do we want
don't know maybe just
so we've got spongy feel buttons as well have we
as well as or w or was that
yeah
that's ru rubber buttons yeah
yeah it was just
so it's rubber buttons so it's not really spongy feel buttons it's just rubber buttons
'kay
yeah
with a rubber case right
yeah so it's not too wacky
reasonably spongy i guess yeah
and the standby button is gonna be different
yeah okay
um i think an apple would be a good recognisable shape
if you start getting into kinda aubergines and things it gets a bit weird
yeah
okay so what what shape are we making the standby button
apple
vote
a apple
oh oh sorry
yeah
shall we vote on it
yeah
we will go for the a a a apples apples
anyone got any suggestions
apple apple a a qu quite a big one as well
right
okay
ah
a big apple
uh
well it could be red
could be a red apple yeah
either don't mind
a red apple
yeah 'cause we wanna incorporate a bit of colour if we can once we find out um
is it
okay
and then we're gonna are you gonna work on keeping the button design quite simple
just like the
just working out what we're gonna do for the next time
mm-hmm
um
yeah
yeah that seems pretty straight forward
yeah
'cause most of them will just be kind of mainly circular or like very plain
'kay
mm-hmm
okay
sorry what was that last thing again there
uh just to keep the shape of the buttons simple
right much option on that
i thought you were going for a single curve and
ah just the uh shape of the buttons
alright
and j yeah just keeping the sort of the labelling them labelling of them fairly simple as well
yeah
fairly sort of self explanatory
right so shape of buttons simple
okay
so that's that i guess
we should now go away and get these things sorted out
i guess you two are on plasticine duty or whatever
okay
okay so um
is that the end
okay
looks like it
okay
so is why not save that
no you'll ha have to open it up from elsewhere
do you want to replace existing file no
i actually tried to transfer it to my documents but
yeah you have to you have to close that window
'cause that's the save one isn't it so
and then find it
spreadsheet
yeah but i've ta uh right i'll just re do it
that's the easiest way
right
well we've made our prototype anyway
we can have a good look at that
you pass it round to have a look
mm-hmm
y no it's a slightly curved around the sides
mm very nice
um it's almost curved like up to the main display as well
mm-hmm
and the little line at the bottom indicates the bit the panel that you pull down
and the extra function buttons are below that panel on the little line
mm-hmm
and we've got the stick on the button with the company logo on
mm-hmm
we also have a apple slash cherry design at the top
so it is yeah
cherry would be alright actually
yeah
yeah it's a bit more fun isn't it
and it's kinda not really at a kind of you think apple you think computers like apple mac
yeah yeah we might get a
mm-hmm
copyright yeah
what's this this one
yeah and cherries are fun summery
what's that one there
ah that's the mute
oh okay
for the m.
right
it it'd probably have to be labelled mute
uh-huh
but um we didn't have anything small enough to write
they're thinking
okay
for the first time well it was hard to get the h um the actual labelling on the individual buttons
mm-hmm
yeah
uh we just chose simple shapes for all them
um the important ones are the volume ones
so we made them a bit bigger
mm-hmm
the mute could possibly be a bit smaller
hum you separate off in colour the volume related buttons from the channel related buttons
so you've got the volume in orange on design there and the the channel is in blue
yeah
mm-hmm
r right
yeah and we chose a v. plus and v. minus
um all these things have cost implications
and so when i done my thing on cost a i had assumed that the only uh button that would be a different colour would be the uh the red apple button
so however i've now
but um yeah so uh but there would be a cost implication on that
i'll see if i can find them
and uh as i suppose that so whether wanted to put in all these colours would be uh open to debate i suppose
yeah sis
well the colours wouldn't like that's they wouldn't be too important but we didn't have any white play doh
have
so that's where the colour buttons came from
an important consideration
right okay so um
and the second one underneath would be the idea for the
yes we'll have the slide away
right okay
bottom
so we've got um detail design meeting
right
so so we've got
prototype presentation which we've just done evaluation criteria um and finance
so i guess w we have to evaluate if that meets the various uh aspects that we're looking for uh from um our previous meeting
mm-hmm
so other than the fact that it doesn't have the second layer but um obviously obviously it would
mm-hmm
mm-hmm
but other than that we got the red apple
we got the buttons and the only thing that has really changed is the is the colouration of the buttons
yes yes
and the bit after the evaluation criteria is uh is the finance
right
okay
and the and the cost implication
the only snag about this is that uh
the cost is probably kind of important
so um and then the production evaluation as to how easy that would be to uh to manufacture
mm-hmm
um
and whether it would uh
so if you had to do a presentation or will you just work it on the prototype
uh that's it
this this is a yes this is our presentation of the prototype
that's the pr
okay
right
so uh as far as the the finance of it would be concern would be to make sure that the cost aye the production cost 'cause you may remember that was one of the first uh considerations was to be in d under um uh twelve fifty or two and a half uh twelve and a half euros
mm-hmm
so there's no redesign
so that should uh right so seems to me that the thing that i have to do is
is quickly find that uh
could we get this on the board just so we can see or do you mean do you have the figures there
we should plug it in
right
do you wanna plu do you wanna plug it in into the the back of that one
okay
'kay alice
so sh
we could do it as we d go along the production costs looking at the prototype
right
'kay this should be then
okay so by the fact that we've got uh the simple chip and the uh kinetic energy source we've got a single curved
case
we've got a rubber uh case materials supplements
so we had decided that we're having rubber buttons and
mm-hmm
have a push button interface
okay
w the button supplements
um
well originally i thought there would just be uh one in there because it was the one red apple
um
but so the so the real w the real question then would come in
do you make all the buttons
well do we'll do it on the prototype so do two see how much it is
o
well so we've got one special button form which was the apple
everything else is gonna be a standard
yeah
yeah
and then we'd have
we've got special material rubber wood titanium et cetera and that so i was originally
mm-hmm
i was thinking rubber wasn't special but according to this maybe it is
mm-hmm
so
and the r i mean effectively we've got sixteen buttons that we're gonna have on there
yeah
i think you just do one don't you for the
w i don't know is is is the sort of answer is that meant to be all sixteen buttons and therefore i mean
what's the op the option was maybe not to have rubber buttons but just to have the one that was soft and spongy and therefore
i think i think it's just it's just a one
else
whereas it would be the special colour would be for the so you would only have the one special button that was rubber
whereas the rest would be hard plastic
i thi i think i think the button supplement i is just a supplement for all the buttons made in a different material rather than per button
mm
i don't know though
i would every design change is uh i dunno um okay um
hmm
if we just had all the buttons as standard except for the one red apple then that would take care of that i guess
we'd have one special colour and one special button form
mm-hmm
and when
i plugged that in last time remember it has to be under twelve and a half
as far as i know that um that took care of the uh of the various supplements
mm-hmm
and if what happened
you've just gone off the window into another one
it's on the bottom row
maybe if you just minimise that one in the top right hand corner of the little box
yeah
now right
okay so but the point would be that if we uh
if we just did special sorry you were saying that it would be that one that you would put in one there
yeah
yeah
okay
so that's nine point one there so we've got some
so it well is it s is no it's nine point seven i've got
'kay
mm-hmm
okay
just give us a bit of
so that would
that would work out fine if uh
mm-hmm
uh as assuming your correction are are assuming that that one change covers all the buttons then that would be fine
mm-hmm
and there's nothing else as far as i can see that we we had uh planned to put on
s
i switching around those th um on the electronics we got the sample sensor
at the moment we've just got the simple chip which costs one
um i guess the sample sens sample speaker would be the voice recognition thing which puts up to four
uh-huh
yeah
we should be slightly over our budget but if we gather something else down to slightly lower standard
yeah
and maybe go with the one the special form buttons then we could have the speech
well hold on
um if we
okay that gives us twelve point seven
so uh maybe if we got rid of like the maybe one of the special colours
kept them all the same colour then we could have the voice recognition without
but remember that the idea was to keep it the colour of the oh i see so just take out the special colour for the apple and
yeah yeah
um
d wouldn't you have to keep the simple chip there as well
um
you know how you turn that one to a zero wouldn't the chip and the sample speaker be separate things so you need both of them
yeah we have to have it
oh possibly yeah yeah maybe
yeah
maybe um we'd be giving up on the kinetic
um
and go for battery instead
yeah
that would give you one less
we should yeah that would save us one though we'd still be slightly ov
but you reckon that i i mean the thing is that you wanted to a appeal to people and not have to replace batteries
yeah yeah
well since it's the through the whole technology type thing um you were saying in the market research that people like kind of interesting gadgets in them
mm-hmm
um whether they would figure the the s uh sample senor and the sample speaker voice recognition be sort of a worthwhile thing to have
and then still have the batteries or whatever they would prefer not uh you know what i mean
mm-hmm
the the problem was the battery's running out and losing the um losing the remote
mm-hmm
yeah
so you gotta decide which of those is more important to them
but which do you think or which do we think is the more important of the options
i think the voice recognition
in a sense at the moment we've got a total which we need to reduce down by one point two
at least
remember that was a minimum requirement
the other option if we're planning on just going for something cheap and cheerful would be to um make it originally we're gonna make it a simple product
shall we shall we evaluate the prototype as we've got it now first and then sort of make decisions about what needs to be changed after
yeah
mm-hmm
makes sense
okay
okay
right um i have a little thing
so we've all got a note of it's thirteen point seven isn't it with everything we want on
sorry do you want that back up
yeah i just had a presentation to
right
do
but i do think uh the v uh voice recognition thing would be more impressive than the fact that it's got no battery
okay but remember the main the only reason we were planning on having the voice recognition was so that they could find the remote if it got lost
mm-hmm
mm
right okay um
this is about the evaluation criteria that we use for the the prototype we've got here
and so the method is that the design team makes a prototype and we evaluate the prototype against some criteria that we've formulated
and those ones are gonna be in response to sort of market research and also finance i guess
and do that on a scale from say true being one and false being seven so if it's neither true nor false then that's four
so i got a set of criteria just based on the marketing that we need to add in a financial one as well at the end
um so
we have to say whether it's true or false that the product looks and feels fancy
um
the whether the product demonstrates technical innovation
whether it's easy to use
whether it's incorporating sort of the fashion element to attract the buyer
and whether it's a sort of recognisable real reaction product
and i have to go up onto the whiteboard and do this apparently so i'll go over here
okay
right
so the first one is um does the product look and feel fancy
so if we do a sort of a one
so
okay well we have a single curve which was maybe like the feel of the product's quite good
yeah
so uh
okay
um then we have the rubber kinda spongy feel which was in at the time
yeah
yeah
um sorry that'd be considered fancy
yeah
yeah i'd maybe give it a
a two
of but i think what is one false or is t one true
i forgot
one's true
one's true and okay
seven's fal four is neutral okay
and a four is neutral
so
so maybe maybe a two
yeah 'cause we haven't got the double curve so we can't like say it's completely true
go for one
right
but it's pretty close
yep
we've got almost everything we can
okay
okay
right
i gonna put underneath so i've got some more space
so false is seven true is one and
so uh say about a two for fancy you think
yeah
yeah
okay
yeah why not not m m maybe nearer three
okay well d you do an average at the end i don't know
two three
um
well it's just that uh saying something remember that when you look down we've got solar power
we've got uh various other things you could have and we're not going for these options
uh-huh
this this is just this is just for like the look
does it sort of look fancy rather than functional
mm-hmm
so
yeah i suppose that might be in the technical innovation bit
yeah so that so sh should we go for a a two on that
okay
'kay
and i mean how much does the product demonstrate technical innovation do you reckon
um deciding between the kinetic power or um the speech recognition
and if we had either of those for our budget they both show a reasonable amount of speech recognition
d yeah
okay
so what about the pr the prototype as it is we've got we've got the speech recognition on it haven't we
um
but not the kinetic
but not the kinetic
like the power
no
'cause you can't afford that w we took that out too
no we c ca yeah we can't afford both
alright so
didn't you
or
so it doesn't it's pretty the prototype as it is isn't sort of um fulfilling the
no may is maybe about neutral plus it it it's got something but it hasn't got
maybe a three
okay
yeah
well wait a minute
in thirteen point seven we do have kinetic
i would give it more than a four
the problem is we have to reduce down from there to get it down to twelve point five
right
okay
and one way of doing that would be to take out the kinetic
so it's very much dependant on what you do with your options
right okay
and if you're definitely going for the sample sensor and sample speaker
'kay
then because that the other functions we've got in are are more at the the special material the rubber wood titanium et cetera
if you go for that th that's at the high end 'cause that's point six whereas down at uh just special colours uh is point two
now you're trying to lose one point two so it seems to me that if you're going for the sample sensors speaker
you're basically then having to go for the cheaper options on everything else
mm-hmm
okay
and and the simple way to do it would be to have a battery to have your uh sample sensor speaker
um
and then you're looking to uh take out uh point two which would be come from the button supplements category
s
i'm just gonna check my email
i'm just gonna check exactly what it said in the email for um
the product
how much of a difference would it make if we made the case in plastic
because we did say that we don't wanna follow the fashion too much
if the buttons are rubber that might be spongy enough
and then it stand the test of time better
um interface type um well plastic rather than rubber
okay
but i
that that that would make the significant difference
you could either you could have it if you have a in plastic rather than rubber then that would uh enable you to get you could keep kinetic then
you could keep your sample sensor and you'd be looking to take out point two
so you could uh fiddle that down your special form at the bottom or your special colour at the bottom
mm-hmm
mm-hmm
and that would enable you to to do it
okay
so it says if we make a slightly more fancy then we lose points innovation
and if we make it more innovative innovative then we lose points on it being fancy so
yeah
yeah
ye
i just read the email again and it sort of says it's evaluate the design sort of as it is i think
so i think we need to think about finance after we've sort of evaluated that design
i don't know whether we're doing it in the wrong order or something or
well okay but
well i suppose it's rubber as it is isn't it
it's rubber as it is yes
so i mean does this need to go up a bit or something 'cause we've got both the
both the um
we got we've we've got thirteen point seven and we've got it in at the moment and if and basically we're going to reduce down from that
the speech
yeah
yeah
but the current one you'd say would be fancy would be too
yeah yeah
yeah
um for for innovation so we've got the speech the speech thing and
mm-hmm
i would've said about a two as well
do you reckon a two
yeah two or three
i'd be happy with a two
okay
oh
two
and the next one is i'll have to get it back up now
the next on well i can just sing about
easy to use
i would've said yes
i would go for a one on that at this point in time
yeah
okay
yeah i would say so as well
um incorporates elements of fashion to attract buyer
well yeah it certainly has some
um
yeah it's got the cherry and the sponginess
it does yeah
um
yep
say about a three maybe
i don't know
yeah m um yeah it was just doing it quite well
maybe two
um i think we're gonna have to lose some of these but the moment as it stands it's um
yep
yeah i woulda said two would seem reasonable
it's a two
the product is a recognisable real
r uh reaction product
yeah this is
uh the sensor using all of its all of its products all of its buttons and it's got a fairly big label on the bottom saying
this
yeah that's a bit rough at the minute
yeah
where it comes from
so this is about sort of the corporate image of like new sort of sleek technology and all that sort of thing
oh
as well as having the logo on and all that
okay
so sort of
is it sort of a recognisable product
does it fit in with our other other products which uh are sort of coffee makers and spacecraft
s
uh well it's got the same um speech feature as the coffee machine
what do y
also it's kind of spongy rubberiness is maybe bit more kinda comfortable than kinda sleek and new age
yeah
um it depends which way you look at it
uh-huh
okay
so we're going for a
so
maybe a kind of three
two three
uh d
two or three
yeah two or three
well the logo would be more um recognisable on the actual thing
it's just that the pen wouldn't really write on that paper
sure
but um
yeah
i think the logo would definitely be recognisable
and it does have attributes that other products do
two
aye
go for it
right okay
two or three
two
how
right come on
two
that's that decided
okay
right
so
right
so we're now on to changing it to get it to fit in with the budget requirements and then
yeah
what does what do all them numbers mean then
do we add them up and rate or anything
yeah we s yeah i think we sort of add them up so sort of at an average is gonna be i'm just gonna do this in my head
about a two
two
one point eight isn't it or something
i think anyway
so yeah pretty close to a two
yeah so it's
so
so it's i mean it's pretty good at the moment but it's gonna get worse isn't it
but we've gotta try and make sure it doesn't get too bad
yep
so should we get so are definite was it thirteen point seven was the definite price rule if has
two b two b two yeah
yes
yeah
okay so we need to
well you can lose one point two and still meet the requirements
do you wanna plug it into yours so we can get up the
okay well i put it back on
the finances
so i guess this is this the last stage once we sort out the finances part of it
i'm not sure
we'll probably have to re rate it
yes i would've thought so
yeah yeah we'll make the adjustments and then see how are rates are going
yeah
okay so what was it control uh f. eight wasn't it
ah it's on
it's come on already
oh
oh
how kind
right okay
so you can see there that the if you want to keep kinetic right
you've got a choice there of going down to battery which would save you one
you've got
the sample sensor and and sample speaker which is your big item
oh actually we just have a plastic case then we lose two points which gets us um
that's right
mm
which gets you
in right within the budget range
yes
yeah i think that'd be fine
because that was just a trend and we do have rubber buttons anyway
so that's eleven point seven and then we could make sure we definitely had all the button supplements
yeah
different different colours yeah
alright
yeah
i was i was thinking that because maybe maybe the sort of rubber case is a bit less in sort of the corporate identity than the sort of you know sleeker plastic case
possibly yeah
um
yeah
okay so
and that would allow us to have all the technical innovations
so we'd lose a little bit on the maybe kind of
so we're going for plastic yes
lose a little bit on the fashion yeah but
yep
oh yeah and that would now be yeah that's that's within the budget
and then
um
do we actually have do we just have one special uh special forms down here
well uh w uh there was debate as to how you would count them
um
you got special colour
well originally i was assuming we had the red apple and therefore that was the special colour
yeah i think we should just imagine white buttons
and we we've we've got we've got enough for another we've got nought point eight left so we've got enough for another
yeah
well we've got special form
now that would be one button and the question was was that all buttons or is that just one button
'cause our plan really was to have one button only with a special so so no matter how you look at that that would be the same
yeah um
but the but but but the
the other thing would then be special material rubber wood titanium
i think maybe the special colour we've got three now just because the volume buttons are different
yeah
i guess we'd have the ones which are blue at the moment would would just be the standard colour
alright
so special colour you want three in there
yeah which i think we should yeah they'll still be fine for the for the price
okay
well i thin i think you you you just need two for the special colour 'cause it's just two supplements you know
one original colour and then sort of two supplements i think maybe
that makes sense
okay uh that's probably it
okay
yeah
so we only ne we only need two for that
okay
'cause i mean these these are moulded
the one colour's gonna be moulded out of a piece of plas uh of rubber isn't it
okay
yeah i would agree with that i think
so special colours two
right
and we've got special form is the one apple
the rest are all standard although you could argue that should maybe be you were making these buttons down the bottom
i was presuming bigger than the other ones or were you
ne uh
was that the idea
yeah the volume ones should stand out a bit
maybe that'll be a second supplement
yeah that
then there's a spe a second special form
uh-huh
yeah
i would have thought that's probably about r well
um
well you got you got twelve
okay so tha
so i think that should still be okay
yeah that's twelve point three so we're still
right
within budget on that
yep that makes sense
um
so decide we've lost a little bit on the fashion and lost a bit on the fancy kinda side of it
yep
but generally speaking we've kept the other attributes to the
i woulda said so
yeah
so you'd maybe put fash fan uh fashion at three rather than two
that's without
so shall we do a well um
yeah
and specially it definitely could fits the the real product what was the what's the company name
real reactions
real reaction produ i'm not quite sure what does that mean
r yeah
yeah
yeah yeah
i mean it still seems definitely fit that p so that's like if that's the new age kind of um inno innovative
yeah so
c type company then um having the kinetic feature and the voice recognition is p quite high up on
uh
yep i would s
so it's w if we've if we've put in for another special form on a button then maybe they could be a different shape
like we got a cherry one
maybe other ones could be something else shaped
i don't know
that would be poss seeing as seeing as it's cheaper to make them a different
um
you mean of
seeing as we've got you know we've made it a a special form
so and that would sort of maybe keep us close on the sort of the fashion type one
and it would sort of you know keep it quite fancy as well i don't know
mm-hmm
well you could argue you might do it once a year you would change because at the moment you're making a red apple
yeah so it's a
well you could
so next year you could make next year's model the same but have it as a a yeah whate whatever a lemon
yeah
whatever fruit was in fashion next year
yeah l a lemon lemon or something
yeah i mean the volume buttons could be lemons or something maybe
and that
amount
okay
so we've what have we what have we rid of
we got rid of
the plastic
yeah we've the main thing we've changed really is the casing isn't it
is it the rubber
that yeah that was uh that was just about all
we've
yeah
i think we've saved quite a bit because we've just got the push button interface which is by far the cheapest
yeah
um
but uh
so maybe in a sense not having that maybe we've lost some maybe lost something on the innovation side
i dunno
and that is like the most standard type of button
so i mean we've got we got rid of the rubber case but
we've now s we now sort of got an extra form and an extra colour for the buttons
so maybe in terms of sort of fanciness and fashionability we're pretty much the same maybe
yeah
so i mean we could maybe put two again on them
and everything else has stayed pretty much the same so
well ease has certainly stayed
yeah plus if anything that is special forms makes it slightly easier to
yeah
yeah
yeah
to use
and what about the sort of innovation
um well we've still got the kinetic energy
do you think
um
okay
and the speech feature
yeah the speech feature
and then the corporate identity
i think we've cut just about the same
we've maybe lost
hasn't it it's hard to tell how the rubber the rubber casing would really affect
how it would play out yeah
yeah
oh
whether whether that's considered to be sort of
part of the corporate identity i don't know
i mean it's maybe not
um
i mean
but i think more the the features of the actual control will be more important than maybe than the the actual aesthetics but
yeah
yeah
but either way i think we've made it fairly close to what
yeah
okay well i mean
yeah i don't see how we could make it any more
um apart from maybe
we cou
doing the whole thing in the kinda light shade of blue like the casing
mm-hmm
but then what colour would you make the r. s
just the the company logo
so maybe there's like a set design which we get printed off
well but you've got the company logo on there which would effectively be a stick on badge
yeah
okay
so you're in a sense you're comparing the product without the company logo
yeah
and then y but you've got the space for it to stick it on
yeah yeah
hey what what what's the company colour
did you get told what the company colour is or
i'm still not quite sure we've established that
no i just we got the logo off the web browser
don't think so
but but i but in the sense that as you saw with um the windows logo badge it doesn't really matter
oh right
there's virtually n the way that you frame you know the windows badge on there it really doesn't matter what colour it is
hmm
so long as our company's logo is framed w in the same way as that with a like a black outline
mm-hmm
fact they've got black and white or black and silver
so basically even if you had a silver the same colour of silver on your display
mm
because you've got effectively a double edging on the uh on the logo it means that it splits off what your logo is from the from the product
and that's actually quite a sneaky way of doing it
okay
uh-huh
'cause you've got sort of we've got point two to play with if you really wanted to
you could put in another well in this one you've actually got three colours of buttons
another colour
or would that be t
yeah
well we decided that the blue ones were the um the standard colour
okay
so you were talking about uh um we're assuming that all the buttons on the second panel the hidden away panel would all be standard
yeah
yeah
mm-hmm
which
m may or may not be the case
yeah
shall we save the point two for profitability then
um
well yeah
bu but but uh was the was there not a button that you were thinking of on the um on the other opt you know
on the second page as it were that uh you were thinking of maybe having as a different colour
um i don't think they would really need to be
i think if they were just all small round blue buttons it'd be fine
yeah maybe we've m
needs to be an enter button but could just be the same as well
maybe for the the one they're gonna see all the time we make it look good and um fit the kind of idea of what they want
hmm
and then for the more functional buttons
we don't worry too much about that and just have that as like a plus it's hidden away anyway you're not gonna see it at the start
yeah
i mean it's the sort of thing that i mean you wanna pick up the controller and just hit a button quickly to change the channel or volume
yeah well
so if it's dead obvious then that's fine
but if you're opening the panel and you're looking and you're tuning then you're paying a bit more attention
so it may be sort of different colour buttons isn't so important
alright
okay
'cause you yeah
yeah
so we just add that to profitability in effect
so
yeah i mean so we've dropped the cost but
right so we're meant to finish up in five minutes
mm-hmm
same sort of function
the criteria
it's alright
'kay
just made a load of money
shouldn't we maybe lose a point on fashion go to a three
'cause we've lost the overall spongy feel
'cause it doesn't seem right that it just hasn't changed at all
well but i think we said that w
because you got rid of the rubber we put an extra an extra sort of fruit um shape on one of the buttons
alright
le lemon sh
did we decide what that was which button it was
i think well we could have lemon shaped ones with the volume ones or something
on the volume ones
right
uh
or something like that
that's good
yeah
definitely lemon shaped
did did you have to have a rubber case though for rubber buttons
or was it the other way around
you had to have rubber buttons if you had the rubber case
right okay
mm-hmm
so i think we can we're okay
so we're okay this way around
yeah
so that so we've saved
until the design team comes in and says get off
but you are the design team
then we say it's fine so it's all good
saved two euros on that
so what bit are we on to
um can i just check if that's a cherry or an apple
did we decide against the apple because of apple mac
and did we make it a cherry officially
yeah
i th i th oh
mm-hmm
right
right okay
just in case we need that point two for lawsuits and such like
oh drats i've botched that haven't i
so were we aiming for a certain target on that scale
well we're aiming for um one for all of them
m but it really has to fit into the budget so
right
i guess we just have to adjust things to
get it i in the
which is fair enough
and we seem to have least something in each criteria
yeah
we haven't completely left anything out so
yeah i think
most
as an overall product which has to be quite cheap we've just about achieved
yeah
everything
yep
so do we have anything else to discuss
i don't know
what's on the agenda
right okay um
what's happened here
right okay um
mm
right okay um right
so we got
we've got the closing
so we've done the
the finance bit and the excel project and the we've done the redesign
so we're now on to project process
now satisfaction with for example room for creativity leadership teamwork means et cetera whiteboard digital pens et cetera
so we're actually now uh in a sense
on to the evaluation of the course rather than the evaluation of the project is m my understanding of it
uh-huh
so what did you and remembering that nobody's just over the curtain
so um
finish your meeting now
we should just go through this quickly and then
huh
yeah
so
i suppose the easiest way of doing it is to put some notes down which i will do
okay
so uh i think i have to finish that page
oh
right okay so
project evaluation
so um
creativity
did you feel you got a chance to express yourselves well enough
um yeah
yeah
well um
yeah
i thought some of the divisions though between sort of the individual meetings were a bit arbitrary
individual meetings
how do you mean
yeah
well we were finding out various things in
in you on your own
in be in between the meetings and they didn't the one meeting didn't always follow on for the other one
you know sort of we had things thrown in at the second meeting where
um
you know you'd looked at the remote controls and seen the curviness
but in the first one you'd also looked at some remote controls and looked at the buttons
and i don't understand why it would be in separate meetings that you'd do that
you know you'd sort of you'd probably present it at one or something like that
mm the only thing you find is in a manufacturing process
you would normally you go to a meeting you decide right you do this you do that you do that
yeah
then you go away
you find out information
you then come back
you then discuss it
you then go and change things around and then go back
uh-huh
yeah
so
yeah i suppose and then be going out and finding more information each time and then diff things will be relevant
whereas this time you're really getting it from a database source so it's not uh well uh anyway
yeah
yeah
so what do you want to put down
i've put seemed okay
creativity seemed okay
um um flow of information on on any given subject given subject um sometimes disjointed
yeah
i think it maybe could have been a slightly more creative project
i mean a remote control isn't the most um
yeah the thing itself
kind of fancy thing that you could imagine designing
um
i can't think of a better example at the minute
yeah
have could have used a different
example pel to increase create
yeah
is this go it kinda kis fits the purpose that it was something everyone knows about and then
creativity
something we can at least look at and think how we can improve on
mm-hmm
you have to do it within a set time frame is the other thing so
yeah
but think like it was a bit restrictive just to say that you have to design a television remote control in a way
i mean it depends what sort of business you're in i guess
i mean this one seems
from the website it looks it's quite innovative but we're coming up with some bucket shop product aren't we that's you know fifteen quid
one of those things
like uh companies can have like a range of products and
i th i uh d
i don't know how it works but i guess that something got sent out and have like a brief to kind of
but the other thing is that uh they're i'm guessing that they're trying to use this um software to to demonstrate how you could uh do a project
i mean m my wife at the moment for instance is uh acting as a computer um for um you normally
yeah
you got a problem so you go to your tutor and find out information to see how to get it fixed
mm-hmm
so what she's doing is she's having to spend a day at the computer terminal at one end so that any student that comes along can uh ask whatever question
and then you or the idea is that the whichever uh person's at the other end can point them in the right direction
show them where to either give them directly give them help or secondly point them in the right direction
either at the library or uh or or come back or go and see joe bloggs or whatever
so uh and that was a project i suspect similar to this
because they they were actually trying to debug the uh computer software to enable um to enable it to work
and of course you had the machine crashing and various things going wrong
hmm
yeah
well sh we look at the last slide see if it's got anything else
mm-hmm
so
i think there's one one more to go
alright so we've got uh
yeah
i mean if you look at their products on their website here real reaction i mean it's all pretty high tech and cutting edge
new ideas found did we find any no
and
it was quite good with this um the white board having that and the digital pens
like that's something that made it a little easier
alright
yeah
yeah
leadership teamwork
we did find a new idea i mean sort of a kinetic remote control
i've never seen one of them before
batteries i think
so
voice recognition especially not could
does
mm yeah
you've got voice recognition computers that's not remote controls
yeah
yeah
well it's a different application of it
mm-hmm
yeah so it's just like the same products but just put together in a different way
okay
mm
so how do you reckon teamwork went
um
that went okay yeah
yeah i guess we all had separate ideas and then discussed them
mm-hmm yeah
yeah
to uh go uh reasonably well
okay
i don't think sort of the budget um allowed us to do anything
bit bit arbitrary
well i mean i don't think it i just don't think it fitted in with the rest of their products
i mean they've got all these sort of you know
mm-hmm
high definition d. v. d. and
portable seven inch d um lightweight computer screens and uh i'm thinking do you know one cheap remote control doesn't really fit in
so we're m we're meant to comment on leadership and the means e. g. whiteboard digital pens et cetera
surely they they should produ
well leadership's a bit of a funny one isn't it
and and new i new ideas found was the the other thing
yeah
but we can't really all fairly comment on leadership because you are the project manager
you were the leader
so our experience of leadership wasn't really
as much as yours
yeah
yeah
now i'd much rather be in marketing but i certainly didn't get this uh computer to work as well as i would have liked
however um alright uh means so whiteboard um so really it's uh equipment
oh
yeah
it worked
yeah very nice
comput computers could be a bit difficult at times but
but i mean i d i don't i'm not sure i see the value in these
i mean they record what you're writing and then what do you do with it
where do you get the recording
do you plug the computer or something
i think there's a little there's a little um chi
so it's not just for us it's for the experiment as a whole so
there's a little there's a little chip i think you must plug it into something and it produces a
should we quickly look at the last slide
sh
right
i think you watch a video of it kind of
i don't know
whether it just produces a big image of sort of everything you've written or something and page after page
right
new ideas found so one or two
yeah
kinetic powered remote control
um
what was the other one
voice um recognition thing
vo yeah
um
and uh
voice
uh was it voice activated um
voice recognition yeah
recognition
s
almost
to fill in these fill in these questionnaires
pretty much
right so uh are the costs within budget yes
oh no
is the project evaluated yes
uh don't forget to complete final questionnaire and meeting summary
then celebration
is that everything
hmm
i think that we've got two questionnaires and a report on the last meeting
yeah
uh so we don't re so really
i tried to save this the last time at twelve point three and it didn't seem to have saved anywhere
mind you the the figure last was was different but it should be poss
alright that did nothing
okay
welcome to the meeting everyone
just gonna attempt to make this into a slide show
sorry guys
you may have to do the function f. eight thing
i did
oh okay
twice
this'll just take a moment
okay okay
or it won't
okay we'll have to deal with it like this then
okay
alright
um
this is the first meeting uh for developing our our new product
i'm heather i'm your project manager
hello
okay
so um
so that was the opening
the first thing we'll do is get acquainted with one another
if everyone could go around and explain their role and um and their name
okay
my name's poppy
i'm the industrial designer for this project
um i'm going to be responsible for the functional design phase
also the conceptual design and the detailed design for the final product
nice to meet you poppy
my name's tara and i'm the user interface designer
okay
i will also be responsible for the functional design phase the conceptual design phase and the detailed design phase of the user interface design
alright
hi i'm genevieve
i'm the marketing expert
i'm an expert at marketing
um i'll be telling you guys about the user requirement specifications for our new product
um i'll be doing some trend watching in the conceptual design and product evaluation for the design phase
alright i'm heather and i've
i said i'm your project manager um
well you can pretty much read what it is that i'm doing
but um um
yeah
and uh tool training
is one thing that we're going to be doing today um um as well as planning the project how we're going to
uh create this product and um discuss
um our aims and objects of this uh which brings us to our next subject is um
um as a team we're going to be designing and creating a new kind of remote control
um we want this to be a marketable product that can be trendy um a completely new style so that
um can really appeal to a to a generation that doesn't want a simple plain kind of uh channel changer
and um it needs to be user friendly for um maybe for an example
for people that um can't see the numbers as well or um perhaps an ergonomic design
okay
so this is a television remote control
yes it's a television remote control
yeah
right
i believe i should be taking minutes on this right now
so alright
okay
um yeah
um the way that we're going to go about this is um we'll have a time where we can um
come up with new ideas alone and and work on the project and then um after we've brainstormed and and thought about
we can come together in a meeting and and discuss what what um what kind of functional design we want to use
same with conceptual design and detailed design
so um
making sure that it it's usable that as a um
and that it's it's feasible to create and uh
to come up with a concept of it want what we want it to look like
um tool training
is is everyone um
okay
yeah
got those notes
yeah
thank you
great
great
um
one thing that uh we're going to do is become more acquainted with the the tools that we have access to for our project
um one of them is our whiteboard
and um as a sort of team building moment um i i'd like us to
um try out the whiteboard by expressing our favourite animal and the charac characteristics of that animal
um why that why that should be your favourite animal
so um i i'm assuming that we should do that now
okay
'kay
with our microphones still attached to our bodies
okay
gosh
okay
'kay what's my favourite animal
do come up
oh to go first
oh are we all doing it individually
this is a team building time where um okay cool um
yeah
okay let's stand up and support you
my favourite animal which changes all the time okay
right now it is an elk
an elk
okay
alright so
a vicious
and it goes like
yeah it's got like big antlers yeah
looks kinda like like it has holly growing out of its head
do you have elk where you come from
yes
you do
yeah we have moose and we have deer
we have moose too
okay
do you have
we have sheep
sheep
'kay um
yeah cows
that's a great elk
uh oh we have a good artist
that is really good
yeah
thanks
i'm quite
this is my
oh very shapely
okay
brilliant
that's a sketching of my my elk and it it is my favourite animal right now 'cause it is a large beautiful majestic creature
that um that um in a way it looks kind of awkward
because it's on spindly legs and it uh but it can really overcome harsh terrain
and although it's gorgeous it's also very dangerous because it has um strong antlers and uh
it can really combat its enemies even like it it's a it's an herbivore but uh it can really defend itself
mm
very nice
yeah
okay
right
right i'm gonna take minutes while um you guys express your favourite animals
okay i'll go next
i am a big animal lover
i like all sorts of animals but for the moment i'm gonna draw a cat in memory of my poor cat that died recently
oh
oh
it's gonna be a bit of a strange drawing but never mind
not as artistic as heather's drawing
bit more cartoon style
but i like cats because they're so independent and they always seem to be doing what they want to be doing
um but that doesn't mean they're completely not sociable 'cause they enjoy interacting with humans as well
and they seem to enjoy the good things like sunshine and um
running around outside as well as being inside and enjoying their food and generally just they just seemed so cool and they just know what they're doing
uh i reckon they're sort of they got it sorted
they know what they want
basically that's why i like cats
very good
great
i'll rub that out
there you go
okay
i think my favourite animal would be a dog but i'm not really sure how to draw one
ooh
i i've never drawn a dog i don't think
i'm tempted to draw a snail 'cause i draw them sometimes and they're really easy to draw
um
i forget her name
right it's gonna be a really funny dog 'cause i'm not sure how to draw a dog
tara
or tara
well there are loads of different types of dogs so i'm sure it'll represent one kind of dog
it's a cartoon dog i think
a s i don't ev oh oh well
it's a scary cartoon dog
that this that does not look like a dog
we can pretend
it looks kinda like a person
i'm sorry
that's pinocchio
how do you draw a dog
i suppose it has a lon oh my god
right
yous know what it's supposed to be
okay
it's a dog
um i like dogs because um they're so good to humans
like they can be trained to be police dogs and seeing eye dogs and they're just such friendly animals
and like they're more of a companion than cats
i've nothing against cats
yeah that's true
cats don't really like me so i can't like them
but they're just so friendly and warm and nice animals that don't look like that
alrighty
i feel like a robot
okay
um well i guess i had the most time to think about it
i'm going to draw a butterfly because i saw a butterfly yesterday that seemed to be like the symbol of spring arriving
and it was actually the prettiest butterfly i've ever seen out in the wild and i though that was pretty cool in scotland
it was like well it was a little pointier than that
at first i thought it was a dead leaf
and then it landed on the wall next to me
but this part was all brown and then it has these big blue dots like this
and then it kinda there was a green i think it was a green ring and there was like red going out like this
it's kinda like a peacock
yeah it kinda was actually 'cause it was this part of the body was really dull
and then it was the most colourful exotic butterfly ever and i'm like wow this is the middle of scotland in like march
so i thought that was pretty cool
and it landed by a wall and let me look at it for about two minutes
i wish i'd had my camera
so that's gonna be my favourite animal because after all the snow it seemed to say that like spring is finally here
yeah
there you go
very nice
great
uh what do we oh
do you hear the eraser buzzing while you do that
yes i do
yea
right
so now that we know how to use the whiteboard um the next um
okay
thing we need to address is our financial department to meet our our budget
um or not meet our budget but more um like what kind of uh selling range we'll be looking at
um wanna make this um selling price of twenty five euros
and so we have to um come up with a way to to create a a uh remote control where um
we can like the price to create it will be significantly less
um we'd like to um
to uh make fifty million euro
i'm assuming that's what the m. means
um and make it for an international market
um one thing we'd have to think about internationally is in the design of um like different kinds of uh v. c. r. s
things like that depending on which country you are
another thing for the design team to think about
um we want it to cost uh absolute maximum of twelve euro and fifty cents
okay so we'll have a hundred percent profit then
twelve fifty
i'm bad at math
okay
'kay
um so now that um that is underway um
it is discussion time
so this is time for us to bring our initial ideas any um
suggestions that you may have so far a um your personal experiences with remote controls
and um um areas you see that uh could be improved in your experience with them
does anyone have any initial thoughts
i find that in the dark it's often hard to know what button you're pushing
mm-hmm
so what's something we could uh do to remedy that
okay
um
i always find that in our house the remote control always goes missing
it's always where is the remote control
yeah
so maybe if you could have some kind of
tracking device for the remote control or some signal that you could find out where it was
i dunno some kind of alarm
you can press a button on your wall signal 'cause it always gets lost
yeah
it's a great idea
it's a great idea
do yous not find that um
like there's a lot of um buttons on your remote control and you don't know what half of them do
yeah
mm-hmm
yeah that you don't use half of them
yeah i don't know what they do
mm-hmm
there's some remote controls where there's kind of a hidden panel so all those buttons that you don't really use unless you're programming or something
yeah
yeah that's that's yeah it is
that's useful
so you just have like the number buttons power button t. v. video button
yeah
yeah
yeah
alright
anything about um the look of the uh remote control that you might have ideas about
maybe it could be instead of like a standard rectangular shape it could be um something more interesting like
any ideas will do that you have at this point
could be shaped like a conch you know
mm
can hold it
a novelty
be like a shell shaped remote
are we going into kind of novelty factors here
yeah
like i've seen phones like a okay
well if it's a trendy original um aspect we're going for
i mean you're the designers you c you can um decide what kind of um direction you wanna go in
yeah
mm-hmm
yeah
but at this point in the in the first meeting it can be any ideas that we just throw out there
yeah
i suppose if we're he heading to have it like make a huge profit out of this it needs to be quite a universally accepted thing
like a novelty thing might only sell a few things rather than like
yeah
a general kind of more acceptable but we don't wanna go towards boring 'cause that wouldn't sell either
mm-hmm
so hmm
yeah
and the key issue here is is being trendy and original
yeah
um that does not necessarily mean it needs to be outrageous
yeah
right
okay we have five minutes left
so just to cover we have one more thing
um like you can go over your ideas of course in your own personal times
yeah
um our next meeting will be in half an hour
so you have half an hour to uh think about what you want to present
or not present but bring to the meeting
um i. d. whatever that stands for
interface
industrial designer
industrial designer
oh industrial
that's me
i have to remember these things
um
you'll be beginning your your working design
mm-hmm
um u. i. d. the technical functions design will will be worked on the next thirty minutes
um maybe how this can be achieved and um we need the user requirements from the manag marketing expert
marketing expert
um you will get specific instructions um of what to do in the next half an hour
and i'll see you in half an hour okay
okay
'kay
thank you
okay
yeah
that's okay
that's okay
okay
am i starting now
anytime
oh sorry
'kay um
alright welcome back fro to the second meeting
and um i hope you had a productive last thirty minutes
um and um i'll be taking minutes on this one and um being hooked up to the powerpoint for this meeting isn't very necessary for uh myself
because it'll be more about uh what you guys are bringing to the meeting today
um so the first presentation we'll be looking at is poppy's presentation
and um
so sorry
so um take it away poppy
okay
um do i need to plugged in
it's it's plugged in
so um
f. eight w
function f. eight
f. okay
function f. eight
sorry about this guys
no problem
'kay
is on
right
okay
i will take this time just to apologise
i i only uh received my emails later on
'cause i was too busy carried away doing my own thing which is not obviously not a very good part of a team working thing
but there we go
i'm sure it's fine
um so i was looking at how we're going to go about the working design
and what we actually need to do and what the remote control needs to do
and it needs to um allow a person to have a portable desi device so they can control the television from wherever they are
they don't need to actually manually touch the television set
so it gives them much more flexibility and allows them to be where they want to be
um from
uh on a functional side of things we found out that wh from our previous meeting
we decided that there're certain points that will make our product unique
um one is the visibility in the dark which was um genevieve's idea
so we need to think about how we could bring this in um technically
and we could use illuminated buttons which we are all familiar with when we're using a mobile phone or um something fam familiar
a automatically um lights up at first touch
or we could use fluorescent materials which would just um take in the light during the day
and then as soon as they go off they would glow in the dark
um also we could use um an alarm
so if we lost the um remote control perhaps there could be a button on the television set itself
which you could press and then an alarm from the handset would sound where it was hopefully in the room
maybe behind a cushion or somewhere
um so that would work
um oop
go back there
um another thing i think we d missed out on on the last meeting was the fact that we should consider the environmental impact of our design
um from previous researches i've carried out on other projects um we've learnt about smart materials where um um specific alloys of metals have a shape memory
so they can be heated and um and cooled and they change the shape of um the metal
so for example a screw that's holding something together could expand and it would force all the components apart
so um the benefits of this for our product would be that when it came to the end of its product life
if it was heated um everything would spring apart
so all the um individual components could be easily separated
and then some could be reused some could be recycled and i think that would be very important for products now
especially 'cause there's much uh responsibility for all the um companies who are coming up with like new designs
'cause all we all know that our resources are being limited and we have to be very environmentally conscious
right um one question
yeah
this um self destructible uh metal it allows for recycling materials
um
so that um someone could have this product for as long as they felt that they wanted it
and then once they contribute it then that company can break down the part the parts better
and then
yeah
yeah they would um you would make the the product as you normally would
apart from the the bits that hold it all together would be made out of this shape memory alloy
and that's the part that would um allow all the other parts to be separated at the end
i mean the user would return the p product to the company 'cause it's the product's responsibility to get rid of what they've made
um and then the company could then just use make use of this shape memory alloys to split up the components
yeah
and then either reuse some bits and other bits which are obviously gonna wear out with time
or not usable they might be like be able to put into scrap metal
something like the case if it's scratched or something you would want to reuse it
but you might be able to melt it down and reuse it again somewhere else
mm-hmm
would we be the company that would break down these or uh metals
or would we contribute to another group
you could we could probably empl em employ a a side company or something to do that for us
but it would be our responsibility to get that done and to dispose of the products that we made
for a certain percentage at least
alright
not every not a hundred percent of everything we produce but
okay
this sounds like a really great idea
one thing we have to consider is our uh one hundred percent um turnover goal that we have for our financial sector
yeah
yeah
um so we'll have to investigate how much that will cost us cost the company um 'cause it sounds very labour intensive
yeah
you would have to hire a number of people and it might be more expensive
well i the fact of the shape memory alloys is that they they don't need to be manually de um deconstructed
like you don't have to individually um unscrew all the screws
because of this their properties are smart material
all you need is just the heat so they self destruct themselves
mm-hmm
alright
so i suppose it does need like high contact yeah you know high uh quality machinery and very specific machinery but
we'll still have to investigate the financial implications
alright
i like the environmental approach
um we'll have to see if that can meet our financial goals as well
yeah
okay
um also
there is um components
this'll be how it uh will actually work
but i haven't put this plan together yet
i'm sorry could you those were um
there we go
sorry should i go back
this would actually show the circuit diagram
although i haven't come up with the final circuit yet
okay
so i just put all those components in
so those are what um we'll c construct the remote
those are all the
yeah
i it just shows what sort of energy source
it could be a battery like rechargeable probably
um an' yeah well how the infrared will actually be sent through the chip to be received by the chip on the television set itself
alright
great
okay
so now is it f. eight again to escape
or escape
there we go
okay
alright
thank you very much
thank you
and um the next presenter will be tara
there you go tara
thanks
can you see
oh
do you think
is it uh function eight yeah
function f. eight
yeah
function f. eight
function f. eight
sorry
the one at the top
oh right
okay
that looks right
yeah
okay
i'm the user um
user interface designer
uh the technical functions design of the apparatus is the effect the apparatus should have
um in this case it's the function of the remote control which is to send messages to the television television set
by taking inspiration from other similar designs we'll try and come up with an original trendy remote control which is sellable international
there're two functional design options
a multifunctional remote control which can be used for several entertainment devices
and a single function remote control used specifically for the television
i'm sorry what was that last one
multifunctional and
sorry
um a single function just for the television itself
ch oh i see
yeah
um multifunctional controls can be difficult to use as the multitude of buttons can be confusing
a single function remote control is simpler to use but it means you have to have other remote controls for your other entertainment devices
'kay
um i think that a single function remote control would be preferable because it's easier to use
it'd be more compatible with a range of television sets making it more internationally sellable
um it will make an original design more obtainable as we have less functional necessities to include in the design
and it would be more profitable as it would be more simplistic
and less functions would have to be included
so it would be cheaper to make
and probably more sellable just because it's more compatible with a r a wider range of devices
does anyone have any questions
so as far as we know um a single function television remote control is us usable internationally
well it's just that when we're creating it we're we have to make it um compatible with different brands of devices
right
and it would be easier to make it compatible with just different brands of television devices rather than other ent yeah other entertainment devices
d. v. d. s and v. c. r.
okay
right
does everyone agree with this
does anyone object and and find the multifunctional might be a better way to go
um i was just wondering about the what what genevieve said before about having like some hidden controls like having the outer casing
and that would probably um i d well well what you said before about it being a more profitable simplistic design
i suppose having that would complicate it a lot more
yeah
yeah
and limit the design
do you think
yeah i think i agree with the single design thing for now because we're trying to do so much that if we're trying to make a unique
user friendly dadada and it's also multi also multifunctional um we're gonna go over budget for one thing
yeah
so
yeah
yeah
that's true
yeah
mm-hmm
yeah
and with this we'll have more room in the budget probably to make a more original design
yeah
mm-hmm
we'll have more money to go into the design side of it
yeah
okay
yeah
alright
sounds great
mm 'kay
alright well um are you ready for your presentation genevieve
yes i am
fabulous
except you're not hooked up to the great
oh i'm not hooked up but other than that completely ready
okay
okay
oh
i just lost my microphone
no problem we can
just a moment
okay
so i'll be discussing the functional requirements of this remote control
um and i'll give you a little briefing on what that means exactly
um if you all remember from the email we got before our very first uh kick off meeting with the coffee machine
the functional requirements of that was to produce hot coffee quickly
um so what i'll be talking about now is the equivalent for a remote control
um so basically what needs and desires are to be fulfilled
um i've done some marketing research a lot of interviews with remote control users um and some internet research
and i'll show you my findings
oh and firstly i wanted to remind you about our company motto and purpose
so we believe in providing international market with fashionable products
um hence our motto we put the fashion in electronics
so i think that should be our priority here
um and we should also be looking to trends in clothing and interior design
not just in electronic fashion
so that it's something that fits in the household
i'm sorry what was that last thing that you just said
um we should be looking towards trends in both clothing and interior design
mm-hmm
any trends that are going on in in the public even media you know who's famous
mm
what t. v. shows are being watched um to influence our remote control
yeah
okay so the findings
um seventy five percent of users of remote controls find them ugly
which is a quite a significant number
um the other twenty five percent didn't specify if they love them or found them you know neutral
eighty percent of users would spend more money when a remote control would look fancy
current remote controls do not match well the operating behaviour of the user
i'm sorry that eighty percent of users would spend more money when a remote control would look fancy
you mean that they would spend more money on a fancy looking remote control
yeah they're willing they're willing to spend money on a remote control with personality
as opposed to your basic you know oval black all same size button remote control
okay
mm
yeah
um so it is something that people care about
it's not it's not ignored in the household
um seventy five percent of remote control users said that they zap a lot
zapping meaning they go through channels a lot
they're you know thumb masters
mm-hmm
um and fifty percent of users say they only use ten percent of the buttons
that a very small amount
thought that was interesting
alright so it might be very appealing if um we have very concise buttons
mm
the single function
and another thing with um lots of surfing we'd probably have to work on something that could be um a lot more durable
yeah
because i find with um channel changers that um a lot of the numbers get rubbed down if they're printed on the button
yes
yeah
yeah that's a good point
yeah
and actually to go with that i'm gonna give you some statistics on the uh relevancy of the buttons how much they're used
and uh how important the uh users find them
so the power button obviously in an hour is only used once
hopefully the person's not turning on and off the t. v.
um but the relevance of that button is nine out of ten
so people wanna be able to turn on the t. v. with the remote control
um as opposed to standing up and turning on the television set
channel selection is used a hundred and sixty eight times on average per hour
that's a huge amount
this is the most important button
um so obviously when commercials come on they're changing it so as you said we want a durable button that's not gonna run down
relevance of that button our users found was uh ten ten out of ten
uh ditto for volume selection so ten out of ten
and it's used on average four times an hour
not as much as channel selection but still significant
um audio settings is used on average zero point eight times an hour
relevance is two
screen settings which means brightness colour etcetera zero point five times an hour
um and relevance of one point five
we're getting to specific statistics here
teletext um now i'm not too clear on what that is
i don't know if you can help me
flipping pages
is that
it's um
it's like the news
or like information
it has t. v. has like information it has information on holidays the news entertainment
yeah
the and what's on
so like a running banner underneath
it's um no it's a button that you press and then you uh like a menu pops up
no li yeah
yeah
i haven't used it before but
oh
it's like
and you have page numbers like for the menu and you press the page numbers with your remote and it it'll come up
okay
it's like very basic internet
very basic internet yeah
sort of um
okay
but you have yeah
like tells you the weather and okay
but you have no interaction back with it you know
like the internet you can send emails and you've no interaction
yeah it's just information that um like television timetables what's on what's on now what's on next on every channel and
right
yeah
alright
well i guess i'm not with it because i wasn't but it's it's being used fourteen times an hour
um and has a r a high relevance of six point five
so it looks like something that we're gonna want to do some research on and include on our remote control
yeah
yeah
um channel settings
zero point zero one times an hour
relevance of three
channel settings
uh probably just tuning in the channels would it be
p sorry
changing the channels
tuning them in at the very start
you know if you get a new t. v. set you tune in all the channels do you th do you think
oh okay
to get the right reception and picture i suppose
yeah
yeah
yeah
okay
mm
um so it's not used very often but people still find it relevant
okay
um biggest frustrations of uh the people that we interviewed
remote controls are often lost somewhere
so that was already discussed by poppy
how we could have a an alarm system so that people can find it
um takes too much time to learn how to use a new remote control
so it should be very user friendly you know
people know what to do very quickly
um remote controls are bad for r. s. i.
repetitive strain injury
repeti uh
ah
i think
is that what it is
people with arthritis and such
that's rather sad
um maybe our
oh i'm guessing that's what it is
yeah yeah
i'm not
i think it is
designers can look into that
um buttons that don't require you know very firm pushing if they respond
mm
yeah
but we'll have to also avoid you know buttons responding to the slightest touch as well
that's a problem
yeah
it is
okay
did you guys uh get that one down
mm-hmm
yep
um okay here's some ideas for you
a large percentage of the public would pay for voice recognition on the remote controls
so i'll show you some numbers here
um so the youngest age group fifteen to twenty five
ninety one point two percent said that they would pay extra money to have voice recogni voice recognition included on their remote control
um and you can see that number decreases a bit with ol s interestingly enough twenty five to thirty five is the lowest amount
um that would are willing to pay extra
so i guess we're gonna have to figure out what age group we're we're targeting and if and if voice recognition is something we wanna look into
and if we have the budget for it
um if we are targeting young adults it looks like something that would pay off
seeing as ninety percent over ninety percent would pay for it
i agree with um if we're targeting young adults then it would be something we should look into
mm-hmm
um financially and and functionally
um and especially if we are um trying to be trendy go with fashions things like that
mm
um ages like from thirty five to sixty five which show lower numbers probably won't be as concerned
so that that's a whole other field of research
i don't know if it'd be if we'd still have a remote or if you're talking to your television and saying change channel
um and depending on how many members you have in households
mm-hmm
yeah
so it m it may be too complicated for us but it's something to keep in mind anyway
yeah
and something that might further complicate it is that the t. v. makes noise itself
right
wonder if it would have
yeah
and if there was conversation in the room at the same time although in theory it doesn't tend to be when you're watching television
mm-hmm
yeah
but could be very difficult to get the specific uh design
yeah
if we're looking for a simplistic design if we need to decide if that is our um intention is is a simplistic design
mm-hmm
yeah
mm
um because if if it is then i think voice um voice activated
it looks like
yeah and that would sort of negate the whole remote control thing
because if people can activate the television with their voice then they won't be using a they won't be talking into a remote i'm sure
mm-hmm
it'd be like the ultimate remote
um okay
and th the last thing here was a an l. c. d. screen
so i mean voice recognition might be a little too extreme for us
not practical
um an l. c. d. screen though might be something that you know you can shift through pages kind of li the way this powerpoint is working
yeah
so that you don't have so many buttons to deal with
um i don't know what an l. c. d. screen is
oh sorry just just a screen like a computer screen
s or like um
mobile phone
yeah
mm
yeah
or like an alarm clock
you'd have an l. c. d. versus just a a normal clock
what what would appear on the screen
i have no idea still
i'm sorry
oh just like an electronic screen
as opposed to just buttons
there would be like a little like on yeah
oh on the remote
okay
like on the top of a cellphone the the little l. c. d. screen
yeah
um now that's i i dunno exactly what exactly we'd put on there
i guess the channel that you're on the v the volume setting
yeah
could it it it would be good if it had the actual programme that was on and what was next
but that would probably be
like linked in with the teletext or sort of like an
mm-hmm
yeah
that would be good yeah
teletext at your fingers without having to access that through the television
yeah
might be quite expensive to do that though
mm yeah
could be
well i guess that's something we can all take back to our respective research
right
mm-hmm
um and finally whoops my personal preferences and thoughts
um i think our priority really should be unique design
um we want something that people want in their home
every remote control looks the same so uh in my opinion it should be um user friendly and unique
so the other stuff might be a little too a little too gadgety for some people
yeah
um i th myself voice recognition kind of scares me off
so if we're if we're aiming to make this an international university universally accepted product um and for all the other thing is like age market
mm
i mean if we wanted to concentrate on fifteen to twenty five years olds we could go for the fancy stuff
but if we wanna make fifty million and and have everyone want this remote control we should maybe
stick to the basics
mm-hmm
and we should keep in mind that fifteen to twenty five year olds might not have twenty five euros to spend on a remote control
mm-hmm
like their priorities might not be a fancy remote control when they're just starting out and yeah
right
and we have to keep in mind the the reliability of our research
i mean you know a sixteen year old boy would say yeah i'd pay extra for voice recognition until they realise that's three months allowance
yeah
um so i i think i think the older generations we should be catering to a bit more
yeah
early twenties that's the kind of age group
yeah
and if one of the largest uh or most complained about thing is that it takes so long to get to know how to use a remote control
twenties
yeah
yeah
i'm sure that something like an l. c. d. screen or remote control would be just furthering that problem
yeah
yep
complicated jus complicating things even fo mm
yeah
yeah
alright
okay
okay
that's it for the market research
okay
before we go into uh more discussion on we want this design to look like i've received some information from the management that will affect some of our decisions
um for one thing because having controls with d. v. d. v. c. r. that sort of thing would really complicate the design of the remote control
um we've decided not to include them and make it a specific just a specific television um function
which is good as as we've sort of decided that we would like to go with that anyway
um for many reasons
so um we have that decision sort of made for us
another thing that might um affect other decisions is that um the management feels that teletext is outdated because more people are using the internet now
and so uh we won't concern ourselves with um navigating the teletext option
can i just interrupt
yep
would you like to plug in your have you got a powerpoint or not
yeah
maybe we can do the
okay sure
yeah i do
i'm looking at looking at it right now
okay
thanks
there you go
thank you
oh come back screen
hmm
were they was the management suggesting use of the internet rather than teletext or just avoiding both altogether
um well i mean we don't have the resources or or possibility of using the internet with the remote control
yeah
yeah
but um they were just pretty much saying that the teletext would not be used
okay
yeah
okay
alright and another thing
this is for the design the design of the product is that um we wanna create um
more of a sense that people know that this is from our company
so um all the remote controls must have our um we'll incorporate our logo and colour in in some way
right
yeah
yeah
so um perhaps um our logo on the bottom or wherever you feel like it would look good
okay
um it doesn't have to be the colour of our um of our company but another thing is that um
just
we need to we probably would have to have that colour and and logo decided upon
um i'm assuming that we already have one but for the purposes of this meeting i i wasn't offered a
like a type of logo or colour so if that could be um somewhere on the design so that we can be recognisable
okay
work on that
it's probably r. r. r. in yellow
yeah
yeah
the little r. r. yellow thing
okay
yeah i think
yeah
mm-hmm
real reaction
okay
um yes those are the changes
um so now we need to discuss um
and come to a decision on our remote control functions of of how this is going to be
i'm just going to look at my notes for a second
um we have to decide on a target group and the functions of the remote control
so um we already know that it'll just be for the television
okay
it'll it won't have teletext
but um you know we could discuss um those other options that you brought up genevieve
okay so i are we going to write off the l. c. d. option
yeah
is that how most people feel about that
yeah
yeah
yeah
okay
okay
so no l. c. d. no teletext and no voice recognition
i think it would be annoying though if i don't use teletext that much
but if it was on your t. v. you'd want to be able to use it if
yeah but another thing is that if we're reaching an international crowd um
you'd yeah
i know for one that in north america there is no such thing as teletext so it'd be really superfluous
yeah
so is it just okay
never heard of it
yeah
alright
yeah
right
i don't know about other countries besides the u. k.
do you know if anywhere else has it
i don't know
i don't know
i don't know
more research required i think
alright
but if was it a management decision that we're having okay
it was a management decision so it's it's pretty much out of our hands at this point
yeah
so
okay
okay then
'kay
so i guess we're looking at something rather simple
um well i guess just from my findings it looks like we wanna minimise buttons
'kay
um
minimal
and the what was the word they used
f findability is important
yeah
i think we should definitely go ahead with the alarm system idea that you had
mm-hmm
yeah okay
yeah
'cause i'm sure that could be inex inexpensive because we could use the same kind of infrared
yeah
the same signalling
the same signal through that and it could just like make a little beeping noise
i mean
it's not that expensive to do
or vibrate just the same as a mobile phone
like you just a a buzz or something
yeah
mm-hmm
yeah
yeah
okay
i like that idea
would you be able to um put the little device anywhere
'cause uh isn't our remote control for
all t. v. s so
if do you mean the the link between the well if the button was actually on
you'd ha
yeah with the button that you pressed
yeah
the button oh
yeah
oh yeah
c 'cause then it would only be a applicable to one t. v. set so it would need to be something that you could stick somewhere or something
minor detail there
maybe yeah yeah
maybe something adhesive that you could like stick onto the back of any set that would be um yeah not very obtrusive
yeah it would have t
yeah
mm-hmm
obviously something small that's yeah that's a good point
yeah
yeah
then it wouldn't it probably wouldn't be able to use it would be able to use the same reception on the remote c control i guess
but the actual device would have to have its own infrared signaller
yeah
yeah
okay
yeah okay
would it need a battery then
maybe um
pr probably
probably i mean
unless it could be okay
that's your department you'll have to sort that out
mm
um unless some way it could have some universal connection to like the socket the same socket that the t. v. 's supplied from
i mean the power for the t. v.
yeah
so mm more research into that one
yeah you'll have to yeah you'll have to investi do some research on that alright
mm
yeah
great
um alright and i'm sure that um
um the glow in the dark fluorescent whatever system um is a go ahead
is everyone interested in that
y
on the buttons
i i like the light up suggestion
i think that would be better
yeah
'cause you know the way fluorescent lights lose their brightness after certain time so
yeah
yeah
yeah
yeah
it doesn't it could it could be a tactile thing as well
yeah
i would go for
um right if w if we're minimising buttons we might be able to make them actually larger
and there's something on it
s you know like up arrow down arrow for for volume
like a raised
um and i don't know what we could do for for channels
s
well just the numbers could be embossed couldn't it
like raised
the numbers themselves
yeah
but then the like up button and down button for the channel channel changing
could be raised
just little arrows that you could feel maybe
yeah
yeah
hmm
i just thought that it it might be sucking more battery power if there if it is a light up
i'm not sure
yeah
that's true
yeah
and also y uh heather you mentioned before um like how it should be accessible to everybody
but i mean
yeah
um so like big b um buttons for people you are visually impaired
yeah
the glow in the dark or light up won't make any difference anyway
mm-hmm
so like you say tactile might be better because it'd be more available to everybody
that i think that's good yeah
yeah
could we somehow we could may possibly sorry
incorporate them both so that the buttons could maybe be in the shape of the numbers themselves and be made out of some glow in the dark material
mm-hmm
yeah
yeah
yeah
yeah
mm-hmm
yeah
yeah
'cause i d i don't think that glow in the dark material um like the actual soft plastic um costs that much more than other colours
mm-hmm
no i wouldn't say so
no it's not these days
i mean it's quite easily accessible
yeah
i guess the other option referring to the battery thing is you know how cellphones will t light up for fifteen seconds or something
yeah
when you're s and then it goes so if if you're like changing the volume during a movie
that's good yeah that a good idea
yeah
i know i'm thinking of mostly when you're watching a movie you turn all the lights off right
yeah
yeah
and you don't want to turn on the lights to turn it down because there's suddenly an explosion and it's gonna wake up the baby
yeah
yeah
um so if you touch the button it kind of reactivates it
it lights up for
that yeah that's a good idea
yeah
yeah
on self timer
so self timed lighting
yeah
alright we have five minutes left
um i
um for the meeting but i think we should discuss this light subject a little bit more before we close
um what was i missed the last moment reading that
what were you talking about with the lighting up buttons
oh just if it was kinda the same way that a cell you know how a cellphone will light up for about ten
fifteen seconds when you touch a button after having not touched it for a while
yeah
yeah
um if instead of a constant light up on the on the remote control if it lights up for ten seconds when it's touched again
mm
so it could be any button that would be pressed
yeah and you you touch it and it just kind of lights up a bit and it gives a faint glow
yeah
so self timed
so if you have all the lights off in your living room you'll you'll temporarily see it
yeah
because usually you're not fooling around for it for more than what ten seconds
yeah
yeah
okay so that's probably feasible
so
yeah
so do you think that we should do the lighting up thing and the glow in the dark thing and the shape of the numbers
do we have to kind of decide what we're gonna do with this
mm-hmm
i think the shape of the numbers is a really good idea
yeah
yeah okay
and i think that's un unique as well
for visually impaired yeah
i mean i haven't seen that
yeah
mm-hmm
and as you're saying like numbers can wear off if they're just sort of like painted on you know printed
yeah yeah
and it could if it's that softer rubber material it'll be maybe um uh
better for people with um els no what's it called r. s. i. what was it that we were talking about
durable
oh yeah
yeah
oh right the
yeah
yeah
yeah
repetitive strain injury
yeah instead of like hard buttons
okay
mm-hmm
um did we want to go for the glow in the dark look
or did we want to go for the lighting up instantly
if
like should we do both
or we can have one or the other
because it might for for our design purposes i mean the lighting up thing might be better because glow in the dark material has a funny kinda colour
mm-hmm
i was gonna say
and it might not go with different like face plates that we might come up with
exactly
yeah
it the it might be perceived as tacky glow in the dark
it's kind of like eighties neon style
yeah
yeah and we could yeah there are now like loads
um whereas we're trying to be trendy and fashionable
so
or a huge range of different colours that it could light up in as well which could like link in with the company colours
like it could be blue or green or yellow or like we've just limited t with the just ordinary phosphorescent so
mm-hmm
right
right
alright
so we've decided on lighting up things
i was thinking though if it was glow in the dark you could put the um real reaction symbol as glow in the dark and then it would be constantly advertised
yeah
mm
every time the that it lit up you c that could light up as well
yeah
yeah
or or the whate
yeah
yeah
but with the same thing i mean
that's true
if you touch the button and then it could be it could be lit up as well
yeah
yeah
okay
is are you okay with that
yeah
okay
cool
um
alright
so i think that um
is
that completes most of our um our more uh practical decisions
and now it's up to designing
and um making sure that this can be feasible
what um oh sorry
and do you have anything do you have anything to say
yeah well i was just gonna throw out there the thought about um personalising the remote control
um it you 'cause you mentioned face plates
so i i dunno if there's something that
diff you know like five different face plates
i dunno if this will start making it more complicated but it could increase the popularity of the of the remote
okay
oh yeah
um
like you can have changeable um mobile covers or something
interchangeable thing
yeah
like an ipod or something
that would be good
exactly like an ipod
yeah or okay
okay
yeah
exactly
or or like mobile ph
like a cellphone
yeah
and i dunno if we'd want to go with like t. v. show themes or something
like a bart simpson faceplate
yeah and then that would be uh more profitable like as a sideline to the remote as well
but
yeah
mm-hmm
y could buy extra
mm-hmm
accessories
exactly
you could start out with three and if if we hit it big then we can add some on
person
yeah
yeah
well that's great
that's a good idea
yeah
yeah
i think that we should incorporate that
interchangeable
um als
'cause that wouldn't be very expensive at all
you'd just get one mould
no
yeah
mm-hmm
interchan
throw some plastic in it you know
and also possible i mean uh we could gain out of that by advertising certain t. v. shows or
oh yeah
yeah
well that might be com problematic with um copyright issues
right
yeah
so if it takes off then we'll we'll we'll try that out
but if we there is yeah
if w
we could um the environmental factor we didn't bring that up again
right
right
we'll have to do more research
like as of yet that has nothing to do with um the way it'll look
yeah
um does it need to be reached a de do we need to reach a decision on that right now
um i've
because we need to investigate the financial implications
okay
okay
let's
is it does it need to be uh decided on now
or should we
i think we could probably leave that 'til later on then
okay
good
alright then
anyone else have anything more to say before we close
no
no
alright well
let's have lunch and we'll discuss this later
okay
okay
alright
thank you
is everyone ready to start
yeah
yes
yeah
okay
great
well welcome to the third meeting of conceptual design
i'll just get the powerpoint presentation up and running
okay
um on the agenda for this um for this particular meeting we'll have your three presentations on what you've done since our last meeting
after we came up with um some general ideas of our design
and um then we have to make some key decisions on
on our remote control concept and how we're gonna make it what uh materials we're gonna use and that sort of thing
the meeting will be forty minutes long
okay
and um we will once again have poppy as our first presenter
okay
alright and i will switch up powerpoint
thank you
okay
should be just loading
okay
oh although i can't see it on my screen
that says go here
okay
i've been doing some research into the different components that we could use um what's available to us f to actually make the remote control
um first of all we have to look at how the remote control is actually made
and what is it happens inside the casing which is more your field
um thes main internal feature is a circuit board which contains all the elec electronics and also the contacts with the power source
which is not necessarily a battery as we're about to see
um there are several components of um
the circuit board that we need to consider where we'll be getting them from what they'll be made of
um including the integrated circuit which is also known as the chip
which is where all the main information is uh contained
um diodes transistors resonators resistors and capacit capacitors all need to be considered as well
um and all their positioning in the circuit
um
are they all included like mandatorily or r are these different options
uh these they're all different options they're all separate apart from the chip
yeah
which we will probable decide whether we buy a simple a regular advanced
we can go into that later
um all the other things are individual components that we'd have to get in separately and work out the most
like effective um circuit including all the wires and everything like that
and the l. e. d. of course that's a light emitting diode
so we could so we've got flex flexibility with colours and things with that as well
mm
okay there are lots of different possibilities for the energy source
we could use a basic battery but that brings with it like they need to be recharged and the bulk the size of it as well
and they're not so great to dispose of environmentally
there's a hand powered dynamo which is a sort of thing that was used for torches fifty years ago
a bit out of date
kinetic energy is something that's been recently developed
um
what is a hand powered dynamo
um where you manually charge up the power
like you wind up something
just every every once in a while
sorry
just every once in a while or constantly
yeah
every once in a while i think
but it's
alright
it'd be kind of strange to always be cranking it i think
yeah
yeah
it would be like going a step back in time
i don't think it would really be with kind of cutting edge technology
no
whereas kinetic energy is a new idea that's being used by some watches and other devices where you just shake the device and it gives it power
i mean the kinetic energy is transformed into power to make the circuit work
um or there's solar power which we've been considering inside a building which is where it's gonna be used might not be quite so useful
right
but good to look into renewable energy always the way
um lots of considerations for the case like what sort of shape it would be curved or flat
that's got a lot to do with the ergonomics
like how it's comfortable and s sits in the hand
we don't want something that's huge and you can't pick up
or too small
or too slidy
i know i've had a remote control before which you couldn't tell which was the front and the back 'cause it had so many buttons on
and the shape was so symmetrical that i'd be pressing like a volume button instead of the on button
mm
because you can't really see which way round it is
right
um we also can choose what materials um the we could use metal we could use rubber which might be more um ideal for the anti r. s. i.
it's like the same sort of rubber that's used in stress balls and things like that so it's very like soft not so stressful on your hands
mm-hmm
wood
um again stepping back in time again there
i don't think that's quite up to date with what we're looking for here
yeah
um titanium is not gonna be possible even though it just it beyond our budget really
but would've been maybe for future projects
um right our choice for buttons as well
we've developed some we've got some good advances in technology with our research team have found some uh new multiple um option scroll buttons
i think that was brought up for um they're basically quite a flexible design modern you don't have to use individual buttons
you can just slide up and down
i'm sure we're all quite familiar with those on mobiles or computer laptop pads
yeah
mm-hmm
um one thing with the scroll buttons though
it it we would have to have an l. c. d. um
yeah
that's true
display and the glow in the dark thing
and that would lead to an advanced yeah
if we have yeah
might be difficult
we're going on to that later with the advanc with the l. c. d. that means we'd need a really advanced chip
yeah
and it's unlikely that that's gonna be in our budget
mm-hmm
um also we've got the integrated pushbutton which is what we're most familiar with
it's the most straightforward
but you can in like incorporate that with a scroll button as well
got decisions to make there
and this is what i was just saying before
linked in the different depends on what type of buttons we have and the inputs
um simple would go with the pushbutton
um regular you could link with the scroll button
and the advanced we'd have to go with a l. c. d. s display
right
my personal preferences
i think we could go for the kinetic energy source
i don't i think that's quite um an advanced kind of technology
it's not been seen before so it could be quite a a novelty factor attractive as well
and also energy saving 'cause you're producing the energy you don't need an external sort of battery supply or solar panels
you just give it a shake
yeah
sounds brilliant to me
rubber casing i thing would probably the best if we're going for the anti r. s. i. and like more choice with um aesthetics
uh
like it could be pretty much any colour we want
um and gives you yeah more flexibility there
and probably the regular chip as opposed to the simple
then we could possibly have the scroll and the push but no l. c. d. 'cause we probably can't afford that one
yeah
um one concern with the rubber casing is that it would be rubber encapsulating all of these chips and diodes and delicate technology as
mm-hmm
like as the exterior
this is the one thing that's protecting its innards
i think that would uh there would be an in sort of more internal casing
and the rubber would just be the what's in contact with the human
yeah
yeah
another thing is it might be more difficult if it's a rubber exterior talking about putting on interchangeable plates
yeah
mm-hmm
um is it i don't see how a like a rubber plate going on top it would stay there
like if it was sort of like a clip on plastic plate
it would work that way
maybe if the um if it was just kind of a more of a rubber coating which was on to a case
w
so it was kind of the whole thing would be removable
like plastic with rubber kind of on top
yeah
like i can't think of what
yeah
well there's there is a certain phone that has like a rubber casing b like a nokia it is
yeah
yeah
or like an you can get sort of outer casing for ipods and something that's just it's protective as well
mm-hmm
it's yeah
yeah
like the skin
yeah
it it stops it i mean it would reduce the impact if it was dropped or something
as well 'cause it wouldn't damage itself so easily
yeah
alright
i think i maybe a mixture of both there maybe
so maybe the
okay
yeah
yeah
so the actual remote would be hard plastic and the casings rubber
and then yeah
yeah
yeah
okay
and the buttons obviously are rubber
yeah
yeah
yeah
okay
yeah
that sounds good
i um is it possible to put designs onto this type of rubber
as far as i know
it should be
okay we'll just say yeah
yeah
yes just why not
yeah yeah
alright
i like the kinetic energy source idea
yeah
i thought that was
um i don't know when people will um be moving a remote around a lot
yeah tha
but i think that it's worth it kinetety kinetic um
mm-hmm
energy source
it could make an we could have any kind of style
yeah
it wouldn't be as heavy or bulky and
yeah
yeah
just for environmental reasons
yeah
i guess it's a bit scary 'cause it hasn't been done before
yeah
so it seems we'd have to do more research on it
or i dunno if you could have a battery pack
yeah
like as a backup for something
backup
yeah so there's there is a one battery because most remotes use two batteries i believe
yeah
yeah
yeah
so if it was running off of one battery as a
that would be good yeah
yeah
some alternative just in case something went wrong
right
maybe we could you were saying about um solar power ma maybe not working indoors but a lot of calculators yeah have solar power
that's true
i just thought of that
yeah
so maybe that could be incorporated as
yeah
may maybe that could be the backup
yeah
instead of a battery
yeah
although it needs some light doesn't it
like solar backup
yeah
do do those calculators yeah
i suppose s but some
yeah you can watch a t. v. in the dark then
so if we're doing yeah
if we're
but thing is it's not you don't need the solar all the time
i don't know how it works
it can be stored
it can be like you can have the solar energy and then it can store that energy and use it
yeah
yeah
it just needs to be in light for a certain amount of time per day
yeah
like a few hours a day
yeah
i think that might be a little impractical though
yeah
i think sometimes it's just shoved under under a cushion and yeah
yeah
that's true
it could easily
yeah
like people don't wanna have to worry about that
yeah
yeah
i suppose it would be really annoying if you get to think oh no i forgot to charge my remote today
yeah
like if the kinetic thing i think what's best about that is that it's instant energy
yeah
yeah
yeah
you don't have to you know you can shake it a few times or whatever
yeah
and it works
or just like pick it up when you're gonna use it
yeah
yeah i suppose
instead of you don't have to like make sure it's in the right place to charge and
yeah
yeah
alright
cool
k okay
's that the end of your presentation
yeah
yeah
alright
thank you
there we go
thanks
oh
it's not on my screen
it wasn't on mine either
why
i don't know why
i think i just i just used the mouse on there
you don't know why
oh okay
is it that one
yeah
that's um
yeah
um i'm just gonna go through the interface concept with yous now
uh first of all i'll explain what a user interface is
it's the aspects of a computer system which can be seen or otherwise perceived for example heard or felt maybe or by the human user
and it's also the commands that the user uses to control its operation and to input data
um there are two types of user interfaces
there's the graphical user interface which emphasises the use of pictures for output and a pointing device for example a mouse for input control
so that's sort of like the scroll thing we were talking about
oh
okay
yeah
yeah
i'm not really sure about the pictures that maybe that's on an l. c. d. screen
mm
or maybe it's
the the buttons or pictures or something
hmm
yeah
yeah
do you think it's
so i suppose sometime after you
yeah 'cause i'm sorry
um because command interface requires you to type textual commands and input at a keyboard so the numbers are sort of like a keyboard
yeah
you're pressing the numbers for um for what you want
yeah
mm
so you must for the graphical user you must need some kind of presentation for the graphics
like an l. c. d. screen
i s i suppose where um mm on some buttons you would have like the power would be s some kind of symbol
yeah
and if you wanted to go onto teletext or i know we're not having that but i mean a similar thing you
yeah
they have there's a like little picture with a screen with lines across it
which i suppose it's that sort of thing like the the symbol on the button
yeah
yeah
but if we're having a simplified display anyway w that we probably won't have to focus so much on that
yeah we'll be doing
it'll be more the on the numbers and the volume
yeah
yeah
it'd be more a command interface and then
yeah
i suppose we need to think of symbols for like the volume display and stuff like that
yeah
so it's just draf graphical for the pointing aspect
the infrared is like that's considered a
i
hmm
no i think it's to do with the actual symbols that are on the that's on the buttons of the remote control and per
okay
so when it says pointing device that doesn't include
for inp
well it could be a wee scroller thing and something could come up on the screen
yeah
i think they're talking about l. c. d. type things
mm
okay
yeah
okay
yeah
but um
i think we're gonna go with the command interface anyway to make it more simplistic
yeah
mm-hmm
but the we could incorporate some of the graphical user um points as in just to make it m um nicer to look at maybe
what do you mean
like i can't think of an example but
sort of like little pictures rather than
oh yeah like how the buttons
like a little sound
instead of saying volume like a little speaker or something
yeah as a button though
yeah something y
mm
so it's a keyboard in the shape of it right
yeah m perha yeah
okay
yeah
maybe
yeah
i like that idea
um the co uh we've decided that the command interface would be the most useful for a remote control
as it would be less complicated and the controls would be more user friendly
um the remote control would be cheaper to design so that we'd have more money in the budget to
um target the design area of the interface
you know make it more trendy and original
we'll have more money if we keep it simple
yeah
i'm sure i like kinetic energy would probably dip into the budget
yeah
yeah
a bit more too yeah
seeing as it's quite a new technology
um
we we also have to keep in mind when we're designing our um more user friendly remote control
that a lot of interfaces consist of a clutter of buttons that um that their functions colours and forms aren't always helpful
yeah
that's true
yeah
that's in like the buttons with all the different like colours for different choices and things
yeah
it can be a bit yeah overwhelming
and that all interfaces are different
so um that doesn't improve the use of the produ product so we need to come up with something that's easy to understand
and maybe learn from the mistakes of other interfaces that can be too complicated for people to use
mm-hmm
yep
does anyone have any questions
do you think that we should keep all the buttons to one same colour just to keep it give it a simplistic look
mm
i think if we go with the um design plate thing we'll have to
just because of colour clashing and if we wanted to so and
yeah
yeah
and we might i mean depending on what comes out of the design we might have to stick to just black buttons
but um
but what about the lighting up effect
you mean different colours for the lighting or
um well um i thought we had um decided that we would if you touched one of the buttons they'd all light up
and so if they were black it wouldn't be possible for them to light up
mm-hmm
oh i see what you're saying
well y
if they were white they would glow probably
if they were made out of rubber
oh so you're picturing the light is coming from the back
i kinda pictured it as kind of coming from the sides and lighting it up frontwards
oh
but but i guess you mean from the back
oh
where would the light come from
okay
i'd assume like an internal light that comes through
okay
yeah
yeah
so there would have to have to be some parts maybe transparent around the buttons or something
right
yeah and well rubber is a more translucent product too so we have that taken care of
yeah yeah
mm-hmm
it should be able to mm-hmm
in the phone that i was thinking of as well when you change the um covers of it the
the little buttons that actually you know that contro control stuff are behind the rubber
li yeah
so you can change the buttons when you're changing the faces
oh
do you know what i mean
yeah
'cause it's just the wee control yeah thing that's behind it
oh
they they insert over
okay
so
mm
i mean we don't have to decide on one colour
each face could have its own colour of buttons maybe
mm-hmm
well if they're raised up buttons
yeah
so that you can feel them
we were talking about it being more
um a lot more tangible
t
um it might be more difficult to do
yeah
if they're if they're sticking up
if it's flat then like o like on a cellphone or a mobile phone
it's like all very flat and you just have to sort of press down on these tiny little buttons but
yeah
yeah
i think it would be possible
i don't think it would make that much difference
i mean the uh the dimensions of it
'cause if it's just like constructed in the same way as like the front cover of a mobile phone
you can like take off the hard cover and then there's the like say the buttons
and then you get to the circuit
i don't think it would matter that the buttons were bigger through the the top casing
i'm sure you could f work it out to fit in the casing without causing too much difficulty
yeah
i'm sure that'd be fine
okay
yeah
alright
if it's do able we can do
yeah sounds good to me
so that's everything then
okay
alright thank you
okay is that my turn then
that means you're up
yeah
alright
yeah
i have a shorter report for you today
um it took a while to get this uh
uh
you're not plugged in yet
oh
that's a very good point
okay so um this report is about uh trend watching
um basically so we can live up to our our uh purpose of having a very fashionable remote control
sorry
there we go
um so just so you know my method was mainly web web based research this time around
i also spoke with fashion experts in milan new york and paris
and i looked at the design reports from previous years here at real remote
um just so c we can work off of them see how fashions have changed
um so i'll list the three most important aspects that i've come across
um and they they're each more important than the one that comes after it
uh the first one is that there should be a fancy look and feel instead of the current functional look and feel
um this should be our priority as we've been saying
the second most important aspect is that a remote sh that the remote control should be technologically innovative
so i think we've done a lot of talking about that just with lighting and the buttons and the
face plates
um so it looks like we'll be able to keep on track with that
and the third most important aspect is that the remote control should be easy to use
so pretty basic there
and the recent fashion update uh according to fashion watchers in paris and milan
is that fruit and vegetables will be the most important theme for clothes shoes and furniture
um also in contra uh in contrast to last year the feel of the material is expected to be spongy
again we've already discussed that with rubber versus hard plastic buttons
um
so my personal preferences here
um of course as we we've already talked about the personal face plates in this meeting and i'd like to stick to that
the fruits and vegetable themes i don't know if that's going to work for us
it sounds something that you'd use on kitchenware
i don't know if we wanna do it on remotes
mm
it could be one of the options
maybe for the television that people have in their kitchen
mm-hmm
um the temporary light up idea sounds like we're gonna stick to that
and then uh tying in a trendy look with user friendliness
yeah
yeah it's the fruits and vegetables is the only
area that i find rather jarring
mm-hmm
everything else we can really we can really
it is strange
um do according to our plans already given the market
but fruits and vegetables seems a very strange idea for a remote control
it's it's a little but it it's everywhere
yeah
well
so maybe we i've seen a lot of purses with olives on them you know
yeah
but i i think i think if we stick to t. v. based you know maybe t. v. shows or
yeah
yeah
or colour schemes
but they still need to um fit into people's decor though
we
right
i think we possibly could take a more abstract design
like look at the basic shapes of different fruits and vegetables
and then just really like strip it down to like really basic shapes
i mean we don't have to make something in the shape of a strawberry but it could have the curves of a strawberry or something
yeah
the
yeah yeah
or a strawberry seed or a leaf
the essence of strawberry
or just like you know really make it a quite abstract if that's fits in more with what we're doing
yeah
yeah
instead of fruits and vegetables just if you look at it straightforward it's a bit yeah
yeah
yeah
it doesn't s quite fit in with the trendy well obviously it does if that's the current theme
yeah
but may maybe we could go more directly i don't know
yeah
but initially i dunno
i think if we just sort of tone it down a bit
yeah and like not not yeah
tone it down
i guess yeah
yeah like more like photos of fruit on on our product
yeah
or banana shaped
one thing i was thinking though is i dunno if you all remember from our kickoff meeting we talked about our favourite animals
yeah
so maybe there could be animal based you know
because a lot of people have a house cat
or or a dog
mm
um that might be getting you know too specific and we should see what the success of the first face plates are
but it's something to keep in mind
mm-hmm
and did you have any questions
pretty straightforward
yeah
yeah um
okay
alright given that information
we need to start making some more specific decisions
so i'll need to um hook up the powerpoint again
there you go
have you guys been saving your powerpoint presentations to the okay
i didn't for the first one
but i have now
but it's still around right
yeah
okay
uh hopefully
where do you have to save it to
project documents i think
okay
okay
i'm just trying to make this pop up now
alright
here we go
okay so we have to uh decide now exactly what we are going to do
so energy we oh
okay
'kay
oh no i can't write it in when it's in this setting
does anyone know how to take it out of
um yeah
just escape i think
the powerpoint
yeah
okay
um so back to decisions
energy we've decided on kinetic right
kinetic yeah
yeah
okay so that's good
are we going to have a backup
hmm
or do we just
but would a backup really be necessary
i mean will people just use the battery if there's no if there's
i think maybe we could just go for the kinetic energy and
if there is backup
be bold and innovative and hope this works and well hope that it works
yeah
yeah
i think yeah
there's like no reason why it wouldn't work right
i think no
so
i i think we should just like take uh advantage of like using this to its full potential
yeah
it could even be one of our selling points
go for it
it could be fully kinetic energy
yeah
yeah
yeah
yeah
environmentally conscious or something
is everyone happy with that
so if it's not working they just have to shake it a bit and that revitalises it
yeah
yeah
okay
hope so
alright the next um decision is chip on print
i don't exactly know what that means
um it was whether we went for the simple the regular or the advanced chip
and that linked in with what buttons we would gonna have so
right and we were going for more simplistic style right
yeah it was so that was without the l. c. d.
yeah
so that means we're not doing the advanced
yeah
so it depends on whether we wanted the scroll buttons or just the push buttons
i think we decided on the pushbuttons right
yeah
i don yeah
uh so that's the simple
mm-hmm
yeah
would we need a more advanced one for uh the lighting the interior lighting system
yeah possibly
so it's probably gonna be the regular chip that we're going to need
yeah
so it's a medium
okay
so regular chip
that's called medium or regular
regular sorry
'kay
regular chip
oh is regular not simple
yeah
lighting
yeah if we because of the lighting that we've decided to put in as well
it's for the lighting yeah
right right right
okay and cases
um does this is this dependent on shape or what it's made of or what
so th
i think this is just like gonna be the a very outer case which we will decide on rubber
yeah
yeah
well i guess plastic and coated in rubber
rubber
yeah plastic coat
yeah
plastic with rubber
plastic rubber coat
coating and interchangeable
interchangeable yeah
um
still going for that
yeah interchangeable plates
yeah
okay
user interface concept
this is your time to shine
we decided on the component
i i i'm sorry i've lost my um
powerpoint thing so i can't remember what it's ca it's the component
your screen
think it was called command interface
was it
oh yeah
yeah
command interface
the command inter
command interface
ouch
the command line interface yeah
did you say command line
yeah
okay
line interface
alright and supplements
what's that all about
um
i think that is well we haven't really made any decisions about
what we're gonna do about the cluster of button functions colours and forms in the in consistent use
like what what are ideas to combat these problems
um
you know how um different interfaces are very different
and can be confusing because because of their difference and because of the different clusters of buttons that they have
mm-hmm
we haven't really decided what to do about that
um what are our choices here
well it's just um
w where where shall we locate the buttons
what kind of functions wi shall we have
you mean like we'll have the numbers of the channels and we'll have the channel changer and volume and power
the power
volume
mm-hmm
so pretty just just the basic button functions
um
yeah
like i don't know if we should go into like adjusting light levels things like that because different televisions will have
may yeah
tone contrast and things
um yeah
that's a bit
that was on um
one of my presentations
about how often it was used
do you remember that
yeah it was minima well it wasn't the l
yep
yeah
yeah it was hardly ever used really
i w
should i bring it up
yeah
yeah
that would be good
and most televisions will come with a remote
yeah and surely that would be like quite specific to the individual television so
yeah each television
yeah
'kay well we know we want numbers
the ch t
screen settings was used um zero point five times an hour
so tw twice every once every two hours
um and it was considered a one point five relevance on a scale of ten
that's brightness colour tone all that
mm
you don't change that often yeah
i think most of that comes like on the i individual television set itself doesn't it
i'm sure it has its own buttons so you don't necessarily need to have it on remote
mm-hmm
yeah it does
yeah and different televisions
yeah
like we i don't know if we can make a remote that would be universal to all the different kinds of
yeah
so we're just going for power channels volume
changes like that
volume
the other one was audio settings
mono stereo pitch
i mean i sometimes use that
some t. v. s will have the option of like living room style movie style
yeah
um and that they say that's used zero point eight times an hour which is actually somewhat high
like almost once an hour
mm
yeah
um relevance of two
oh
we have five minutes to finish our meeting
crap
okay um let's do this fast
um
well that didn't some up on mine
should we have audio
it only comes up on mine usually
it w it would seem silly if we'd having anything else just have an audio button though
oh
do you know
yeah i don't i it's it's a problem with the international uh appeal i think
um if we have audio because we don't know how other televisions work
but we
but we know that everyone has this and it's the same
yeah i guess that it affects the marketing 'cause it
i've
mm it is a good sales ploy to say aren't you annoyed with remote controls that have all these buttons
yeah
this one has channel volume and your channe and your power
yeah that's it
that could be a sales pitch
we can just go for make it a selling point that it is just the basic
yeah
yeah
simple and
yeah
yeah uh i brilliant
okay
alright
yeah
good
and okay in closing 'cause we only have five minutes
we'll be meeting again in thirty minutes
um
you'll be working poppy will be working on the look and feel design
wait a minute
is that right
mm-hmm
yep and um the user interface design so this is where the trendy stuff comes in
and you'll be evaluating the product
um
poppy and tara will have to work together using modelling clay
and um your personal coach will give you the rest of the information of what needs to happen
okay
alright
so anyone else have something to say
um i just have one question about the whole fruit and vegetable aspect
yeah
yeah
mm-hmm
are we seeing as that was the most popular thing that came up out of your market research
i thi i think we should keep to that rather than moving to animals or something
because even if that may not seem obvious to us if that's what the surveys brought out i think that we should probably go along with that
yeah
yeah
yeah
um so i suppose that'll come out in our dev design development
but you're happy to go ahead with the fruit and veg
now do you guys need want an idea of how many uh are you gonna come up with casing ideas
like f five different
y yeah
yeah
five
what i
what i was thinking what do yous think of this
um having the numbers kind of like not a bunch of grapes but you know like purple and kind of in a triangle
mm-hmm
like grapes
yeah you can have some fun with the buttons it's true
like that's kind of fruity or something
mm-hmm
that's just
yeah
we can have a look at those ideas yeah
yeah
i guess what you i ideally you'd kind of think of age markets as well
so it's a something that will you know appeal to the fifteen to twenty five year olds
yeah
something that your granny would want on her remote control
um and international tastes as well so
yeah
yeah
not easy
tricky
a lot of things to consider
yeah
yeah
lots of yeah
hm
okay
alright
'kay we'll stick to the fruit and veggie theme then
alright
and um we'll reconvene in thirty minutes
okay
okay
'kay
okay
bye
thank you
i'll see you later
oh what did i just do
okay
okay
here we go
alright the agenda for thi oh
alright
um the agenda for this meeting is um we'll initially have the prototype presentation by our two designers
and then we will evaluate it given the criteria that um that we gave
gave it
and um talk about our finances whether we were under or over our budget
i have a um a spreadsheet where we can calculate um our prices for every aspect of of what we've made given our options
and um evaluate the product as a group
okay
and um
so first we'll have the prototype presentation
do you need the um powerpoint for this
um yeah
i just got a few slides so show them
alright
thank you
um
do you want to present it
this is what we came up with
yeah here we are
it's a pretty simple design
it's um based on a mango
yeah
and we
mango shape
on
a mango
okay
yeah
and we have the company logo here and this will be the
infrared here and this'll be the power point the on off button kind yeah
the l. e. d.
oh
okay
i'm sorry
what was the where's the l. e. d.
oops
it's in the middle of one of the little r. s
oh
okay
and then the other one is the power
and uh we just have a simple design
we wanted it all to be
so it's palm held
accessible from your thumb yeah palm held and all the
yeah
yeah
buttons are accessible from your thumb
notice you have a number ten button
so you don't have to
oh that was a mistake wasn't it
okay
right no that's a zero
you just need the nought
take that one off
sorry
i was in charge of the numbers
no problem
ah
and this is just if you've got like eleven or twelve or
thirt the plus
so one plus one would be eleven or
you can go one three or something
oh
you press that first and then you go one three yeah
you press a plus button
oh okay
i've never heard of that kind before
well we just thought we have all the numbers here so we wanted something representative of numbers larger than ten and
yeah because if you on your average um remote if you press one twice you just go to um or uh say you wanted channel twelve
yeah
you press one and then you go to channel one and then two then you'd just go to channel two instead of twelve
yeah
oh there's no e okay
so if you did like one plus two you could go to channel twelve or two plus two is channel twenty two
so the plus and then yeah
oh
i
okay
but
would you have to go zero plus one if you wanted to go to channel one or two
no no th all that's why we have all these numbers
these numbers um
these numbers all work independently up to nine
yeah but i mean if you press it'll go to that channel right away
yeah
'cause you gotta press the plus afterwards
oh no
uh the plus is only for if you're going past the number nine
yeah i know but if if i wanna go to say number like sixty five channel sixty five
sixty
if i press the six it'll go to channel six
you p
and then i'll press the plus and then it'll go to six and then put the five and it'll go to sixty five
oh
no you press the plus first
i i well it doesn't we haven't really s i would've thought you pressed the plus first and then the six five
oh
but she says plus press which what do you think is simpler
well i don't mind we can further define that
i th
it's a
um
i wouldn't have thought it'd be a problem that it went to channel six first in like on the way to channel sixty five
yeah
yeah it wouldn't be a problem
yeah
but i was just wondering like as long as we realise that's what it'll do
but i suppose it's not as snappy
well the there is a there's a delay on remotes i think
oops
where you can have it it's like a five second input time
yeah
yeah
yeah
if you don't put it
so as long as you hit them dada
yeah
yeah
yeah that yeah
it should be fine
yeah
as long as there's not a big pause between the t hitting the two buttons
mm-hmm
yeah
so
um
was there so on the top there is volume and
and channel which is so you could just go like that without thinking about it like
a channel
channel up volume up
okay cool
c. and v.
just so we can flick
right where um where's the power button
yeah
it's in the middle of one of the little r. s
it's the bigger r.
it's the r.
oh okay
so it's just like
yeah so it's all accessible
yeah
we deci
without m taking your hand off the remote
yeah
yeah um we went for like a a circular design for the numbers because we thought that's kind of a more natural movement than just going like that with your thumb
mm-hmm
oh okay
uh e ergonomics are all considered
mm-hmm
yeah
and it might actually help with the repetitive stress injury as well
ergonomic definitely ergonomic
yeah
it could cause another type of repetitive stress injury though
okay
but yeah no i mean it's a different movement so yeah
yeah
um and the feel of it i mean we've made this out of play doh
which is representing the you know the rubber and the spongy rubberness
the spon yeah
yeah
um 'cause it was said before in the material specification that this the this anti r. s. i. um material is often used in stress balls so this has got a you know a bit of give to it
yeah
and it just feels feels different
yeah
bit of a stress ball feel
yeah
would you like to feel it yourselves
yes
how it fits in the palm of your hand
i would
my goodness
thanks
there you go
and you
yes
genevieve
yeah
oh it's nice
oh i think i killed the five
i did
i killed the four
and something hmm
oh god
o
okay as for the colours we were presented with um a limited range of colours for this prototype
oh it smells good
of play doh yeah
but we're thinking that seeing as we're having it in interchangeable casing anyway
that this is not necessarily a representation of the true colours that we would necessarily use
or the combination
um and we're thinking to carry on with the fruit and vegetable theme
the colour um combination just could just be named after different fruit like banana could be black and yellow
oh right
watermelon red and green or vanilla might be the most popular if it just uh blends in more settled cream instead of the others are all a bit garish
'cause it'd be quite subtle and
yeah
it looks more
think like vanilla and banana would
banana's more representative of our colour scheme like the company the yellow and black
yeah
okay yeah
so that for corporate identity that would probably be the most strength
i mean watermelon you know m probably appealing to the yeah seasonal
kinda christmas you know
yeah yeah yeah
apple green brown more kinda trendy you know khaki
yeah
the pomegranate's kinda girly and funky kind of and then the vanilla's more for the more sophisticated customer who just wants something that fits in with all decor
cool
yeah
okay
um yeah we thought of the components it was definitely um a focus of ergonomics and just a single ha handheld device
i mean you don't need to use both hands one hand to hold this and type in with the other you can just use your thumb
yeah
um as we said the rubber's probably used for comfort and anti r. s. i. and that's about it
alright thank you very much
good work everyone
bravo
alright
and so now that we've we have a prototype uh we need to go over the finances and seeing if this prototype matches uh what our budget can handle
mm-hmm
so i have
something i'm going to
you want the
oh wait a minute
do you need to do a presentation first
i don't know what order it goes in
yeah
i'm gonna check that out for a second
i have one
mm go
what time is it anyw
oh yeah sorry you're right
evaluation cri okay
evaluation criteria is next in line
that's me
yeah
hello
oh there we go
okay
come on my computer
come on
sorry my computer's giving me technical difficulties
just press um function eight again
should i press it again
last time i did that it sh
okay
you're right
and then again i think
one more time
oh
still not there
yeah
yeah
okay now i think for this one i could would you guys prefer use the whiteboard or mayb maybe i'll just do it on right on the screen where you can see it
um we're gonna be doing an evaluation report together based on the protoptype that we've just seen
um and looking looking back at my notes from our both our conceptual and our functional meetings
um i made a list of what our original requirements and goals were um back to our kick off meeting this morning
um and we'll evaluate as to whether we've s done what we set out to do
um and we're gonna do it on a one to seven scale where one is true and seven is false
so basically the lower p the lower the points the better
okay so question number one
does the remote whoops
sorry
oh i'm not gonna be able um i'll do it on the whiteboard
i can't change it so i'm g i'm gonna ask you to push it down once
okay
i'll write down our scores up on the
ooh
okay so number one
do we have a fancy look and feel
mm
feel i think
we've been quite successful with the rubber coating and
yeah
the look is a little bit more playful
well
yeah
yeah
yeah i guess that depends on your definition of fancy but it's definitely different
it's not your traditional yeah
oh definitely different yeah
i think the colour has a lot to do with it
i mean th the colours we were given for making the prototype aren't the colours that i think we would've necessarily chosen
mm-hmm
yeah
it's not the kind of ooh uh at all sleek red black and yellow and orange
oh you were only given red and black
oh okay
yeah so not very sleek and we don't wanna go for black because most remote controls are black or grey
um
yeah
so we want it to be stand out that way anyway
yeah
but if you can imagine that in like a s just a maybe uh a kind of pale metallic y finish or something
okay
yeah
a metallic y finish we were thinking
mm-hmm
well i know know it's for rubber
yeah
polished
i mean diff if you can visualise this in nice colours i think it would look quite fancy
okay
yeah
yeah
yeah
i kinda i like the potato look
oh well potato mango fruit and veg
we we were we were thinking about yeah
it's mango
it's very different
it's what
it's mango
oh sorry the mango the mango look
potato's fine
yeah it is fruit or vegetable depends on your mood
potato's fine
yeah
totally
it's really adaptable
so i myself would say a one or a two
yeah
i would say two
personally
i w i'd say two i think
it's a two
okay and p
for the
fanciness
fancy
yeah
one being true
so
i uh two three
two
okay actu that's pro that's gonna get confusing like that
yeah
okay so question number two was is it techn technologically innovative
so i know we have the kinetic energy which is very innovative
yeah
yeah and the use of the rubber
use of the rubber the use of the l. e. d.
yeah
for the anti r. s. i.
yeah
the l. e. d. use isn't particularly innovative and we don't have any scroll buttons it's all pushbuttons
isn't
mm
there's no l. c. d. control so if we're thinking about the rest of the market it's sort of probably halfway
mm-hmm
yeah
in some aspects it is like we said
yeah
i'd say maybe three
i'll go for three as well
yeah
and i think i mean it it's tough to say because we were we didn't want it to be any more innovative than this
because then that would've defeated the purpose
yeah
no
yeah we want it simple
though it was our specification
wouldn't be simple yeah
so i mean i we'll put three but i think we actually reached our goal
yeah
yeah
we didn't want it any more than that
okay question number three
uh will it be easy to use
i think so
yeah
yeah very
yeah
yeah
yeah
yeah
i think one for that
s
yeah i think it's you can't really get confused with that
yeah
yeah
one
yeah
no
i mean there'll be s we have to work out the uh number the plus system
th
the plus number thing
yeah that's the only thing yeah
but once that's figured out it should be fine
yeah and perhaps the turning on but
number four
is this a good looking remote
mm
remember that seventy five percent of users find most remote controls ugly
it's definitely
again i think the colour comes into this
yeah colour will definitely be a factor
mm-hmm
i think that the logo could be smaller
okay
yeah
and maybe not such a prominent way
but the
maybe like at the bottom kind of
remember the management said that it it had to be prominent
not in
whoops
oh it just had to be on there i guess
should just not touch it
yeah
don't worry
this time it's the three i killed
i was just wondering if it should be like flatter
or
i suppose i've got quite big hands
i like the appeal of it being like a big glob in your hand
well
yeah
but you know what i've just thought of there now
what where's it gonna sit in your living room
is it not gonna fall off the arm of the sofa
maybe if the bottom was just sort of flat and then the rest is like
yeah the bottom could be like ch chopped a bit
yeah
but then it wouldn't sit as comfortably in your hand
round
oh
that's true
it would still be comfortable i think
yeah
thing is like that it's not going anywhere particularly
we c we could handle it i think
maybe it could it could be on the bottom so you wouldn't loo like if it's flat here so it sits up
yeah
like that
oh that would be nice
ah it'd fall over all the time though
it'd be annoying
uh yeah it's less um what's th ha
yeah
i g
if it's weighted maybe
h it's got higher centre of gravity like that
'kay we're done designing
details details
okay
come on
so is this a good looking remote
would we wanna show it off to our friends
three
you would though 'cause it's bit it's more interesting than other remotes
yeah
i think it was another colour and it was like i think it'd look okay
i think maybe a two
yeah
i mean i gue yeah it's personal taste but
i would definitely go for that rather than like your average plain old remote like that but definitely in another colour i'm not happy with those colours
yeah
yeah
okay so should we say two for that
sure
yeah
yeah
yeah
okay
uh question number five
what's um will people be willing to spend twenty five euros on this product
remember that eighty percent of users were willing to spend more money when a remote control looked fancy
i think we have to market it in the right way that um to say that it is simplistic
mm-hmm
yeah
so people don't just see it and think uh this is so simplistic i don't want to spend twenty five euros
yeah
we have to market it
yeah it the marketing will have a lot to do with it
yeah
and the kinetic energy shaker style y whoo ooh no
and the kinetic energy part
yeah
yeah
shake it and the buttons fall off
durable
but you know those'll be firmly on
don't shake
oh no the plus
you're use the zero
no i guess i don't know much about the remote control industry how much your average sells for but i know i am aren't i
make a new one
but you're our marketing expert
i think they're about ten po ten pound aren't they
about ten pounds
but you don't have to buy batteries
fifteen
so in the long term this can actually save you money
yeah
mm yeah that's true
oh
so we'll market it that way too
exactly
yeah
exactly
so yeah i think with a good marketing scheme um and the personalisation options it'll
good point
yeah
i would give it a two still though
yeah
yeah
yeah
mm
okay number six
can someone read it out
does this prototype match the operating behaviour of the average user
or
mm
yeah
um yeah
so that was mainly that the statistics we said
yeah
i think it does very well
oh yeah
because yeah because the most accessible buttons are the volume and the and the channel changing
the zap yeah
mm-hmm
and it's just you won't have to think about it
yeah
you don't have to look down to find them
they're clearly there easy to use
yeah
yeah i guess the i think the key word there is average 'cause there were some people that used the uh video input and sound and stuff
simple
uh
yeah
but they're not you and i really
mm
so
yeah
okay so one
yeah
yeah
okay
number seven
c heather could you push it down
will this remote control be easy to find when lost
remember that fifty percent of users lose their remote regularly
now is there the is the alarm system still was it implemented
we have the alarm system
yeah the bu when you press the alarm system the lights behind the and it'll vibra
it
yeah l lights on and or flash as well
but i mean it's not obviously obvious from the outside that that's gonna happen 'cause you can't s particularly see an alarm
it'll be again in the marketing
i thought the light from the inside was gonna light up
yeah
the light it will
or or was it gonna make a noise
but
yeah
but when the alarm's not yeah
but both
if you
you press the button it makes a noise right
it turns into a duck and starts quacking
yeah
yeah
you could s yeah
oh that would be brilliant
yeah
here i am
awesome
awesome
i'd be tempted to
well the thing is if it was had an alarm system i mean
um
when it when it lights up as we i mean it could light up when the alarm went
yeah
but if it was hidden underneath the cushion or something there wouldn't be any point
so you can't see the alarm but it would light up
it would have to be in the market
i though w it was gonna make a noise
okay
yeah
yeah but you still couldn't see it
alarm but you can't see an alarm inside uh the alarm system itself
it would just be a little speaker on the back or something
okay
we oh you're just explaining why it's not on the prototype
yeah
but yeah it'll be there
yeah
so we can we could say that
oh okay
it w yeah
whoo
okay
sorry
we can give it a one because compared to every other remote ever m ever made this one will be easier to find
yeah totally
yeah
okay
um
sorry heather
that wasn't very clear
no problem mm
question number eight
will it be easy to learn how to use this remote when brand new
remember that thirty four percent of users usually found it difficult
so it has to be yeah it's eas they'll pick it up and they'll know what to do
totally
so the plu the plus w once that's written down on the page that'll be really simple won't it
the plus thing needs to be worked on
yeah
yeah i think just because it's we've decided to reduce it down to the basic buttons i think that in itself makes it so much easier to use
yeah
well
yeah
do
does it make more sense for the middle one to be an just an enter button
so then you would have to push two buttons every time at least
yeah so it's just like channel six six enter
that kind of annoys me though when it's zero six when you have to press i don't know why
mm
yeah but you don't have to press zeros
you could just press six enter or one two enter
oh okay
and or sixty six enter y
and then like twelve enter
right
alright aye
yeah
yeah
yeah i think that's probably more straightforward
yeah
good
yeah
um okay so we can we'll say yes it's uh one
i'd say w yeah one
yeah
yeah
okay
ooh
mm
question number nine
oh
uh will it minimise the effects of r. s. i. which was repeated strain injury
yeah
injury
um which affected over a quarter of users
hmm
s
i think so
it's like right in the
but if you're zapping yeah
your thumb might get a little bit uh
yeah that's what i was thinking
i don't think it will f
we may have to do some more research into other strain injuries that we don't know about
yeah the biology
yeah
but it is soft
mm-hmm
it's soft and
and that's kind of what the um
mm
mm
and people could
the powerpoint slide thing said would be good for r. s. i. so maybe it is but
yeah
yeah
mm-hmm
i don't know what other options there are
i think we're getting that's true
yeah
could i mean you could hold it in your left hand and d use your index finger
but there's not really any other options unless it's like a keyboard
mm
so i think we did as as much as you can with a remote control
yeah
yeah
yeah
so one or two do you think
i i'd say t two
i think yeah i think too
yeah
two okay
yeah
okay number ten
did we somehow incorporate the company colour and logo
yes we did
yeah
now is the colour gonna be there even if it's like vanilla
n we we can't really do that because for example on the banana theme we can't have it as being yellow
is the yellow
mm-hmm
it won't stand out
so n it's not always gonna be the same colour
it sounds like the colour's something that we
well yeah the colours are yellow and grey
yeah
gray yeah
so it could be grey on the banana one
yeah could be grey
yeah
but i mean the yell yeah d yellow's ugly though depending on the
yeah that's right we didn't even rea
so i think we'll have to talk to our executive managers and see if we can get away with just the r. r.
mm
yeah
yeah
i think this is the
the factor that we've been least successful in confronting
okay
perhaps a metallic or or like that's grey and it wouldn't be that expensive to have a little bit of metal
mm yeah
no
yeah
that isn't rubber
and the buttons in the middle
okay
yeah
so do you think that's more of a three then
three four
four i think
four
well i don't what do what
well we have good reasons for it so we but we can still put a
hum
a four
okay
okay
okay and final question
um did we stay true to our motto and put the fashion into electronics
current trends of fruits and veggies desire for sponginess
i would say so
following that briefing we did
but maybe more like two 'cause there's no like pictures of fruit it's just sort of naming it by a fruit
yeah
yeah
yeah
with the with the colours
like um the colour scheme names and stuff
yeah
no uh are the plates interchangeable
i think i missed a few they are
yeah
yeah
yeah
so you can have banana and kiwi and okay
yeah
yeah
yeah
yeah
okay so that's something that's kind of in the making too like maybe it'll become more
that's fashionable in itself to have interchangeable plates
mm-hmm
it is
i think w yeah i think one
well that was our brief and we followed the brief
well we haven't got a big banana but
the thing is i think if somebody saw that and you said what was that inspired from i don't know if you'd instantly say mango
oh yeah
be like
no
no
yeah
maybe if it was scented
oh that would be class
oh yeah
there we go
that would be great
yeah we have money for that
um
um
alright so based on this evaluation do we average them out sorta thing
yes we do
so i wh what was i gonna put for that
a two for fashion
oh
i would say two
yeah
two
okay
okay so our average there five six eight ten eleven
twelve thirteen fifteen nineteen twenty one divided by eleven
it's
is
one point nine or something
it's
yeah
i don't know these things
between one and two
um between one and two
between okay
so that's pretty fantastic
close to two
um
yeah
yeah that's very good 'cause the highest we coulda got is one
i got
alright
does that seem right then
yeah 'cause we've a four to bring down
okay
mm
it seems like it should be more around two
uh aye
yeah
yeah
uh should've added five
do we have an online calculator
i'm attempting to do that right now
this is
okay
yeah it is one point nine
ooh
yay
oh wow
well done
go heather pauls
well that's excellent
yeah
alright now with that over and done with our next step is to see if we are under budget
and um my computer's frozen
and now it's not
okay
so
um in our shared folder if everyone could go there right now um
sorry
i'm going to um steal a cable
are you gonna do that
okay
um it's it's um
is that the project document
it's an excel file
oh
production costs
yeah
yeah
'kay there we go
um production costs
and um i have to access that as well
it says it
one moment
'kay so far i've added what i think or what is going on
great
it's blinking at me
it's locked for editing
read only
i'm gonna open up a second one then 'cause it's locked for editing
i have the original in my um
my email account
oh is it locked 'cause i'm in it
i dunno
i think it just means that we can't add any more to it now
or okay
have you have you completed it
no
oh right
no i was hoping that you guys could
okay
okay
um there we go
okay here we go
so we need to tally up how much our w our product will be costing
so um if you can look up at the screen
um the large screen oh i guess looking at your own too and telling me which one you think
yeah
okay we're using kinetic which is quite a large expense at three euros
yeah
oh right
um we're using a regular chip
yeah
um it's cur it's double curved so its curved all around
double double curved yeah
that's another three
we're already at five
um we're using plastic and rubber so
yeah
good thing plastic is free we're at eight
um
what about a special colour
s
are we using that
yeah
i guess we should do it just for one kind
yeah
so it's like special colour well we'll have two colours right
yeah
well one colour for the case one colour for the buttons
mm-hmm
so we can
yeah
um we have push button interface so that's inexpensive
and um we have a special colour for the button and we also have a special form
and a special material
and a special material
yeah
oof
which puts us just barely under budget
hurray
congratulations guys
mm
's good
yeah
good work guys
so um our operating cost is twelve twenty euros
that's good
awesome
and back to our powerpoint
so we've
'kay
yes we are
so we need to do a product evaluation again which is probably um
i dunno
a different extension of a
of the actual project rather than the product
yeah
hmm
a project
is is yeah
yeah 'cause we're talking about leadership teamwork
so wh how we actually went round uh about doing it
yeah
alright so um
do you guys feel like there was room for creativity
i think we were pushed
mm-hmm
pushed for creativity
i mean we weren't really given a lot of time or materials yeah to go about our design task
the ma
or materials
yeah
so i think we could've done with a bit more time
ye okay
so it'd be like
need more time and
materials
yeah
but you were allowed m creativity
yeah
i think so as like but you were supposed to have creativ
yeah and the conceptual and functional
like we were very creative in in coming up with an idea i guess but m
yeah
yeah
well we were just limited by resources really and like if we had decided to use the l. c. d. screen
when we can down to it
yeah
okay
right
and like solar power backup and everything then we wouldn't have been able to afford that
so that did limit
creativity
creativity
right
just resources
mm-hmm
okay
but yeah
the fruit and veg idea
great
leadership
yeah
is this me being like guys do you like me
good leadership i think we stayed on task
um
yeah
yeah we did
yeah
we've uh seeing as we've come out with what we intended
a pro um a product within the budget
i think that's a sign of good leadership and also our personal coach helped us along the way so you know
mm-hmm
yeah
and the timing was good
i think it's been fine
we never were pushed for time or sat around doing nothing so
yeah
yeah
good timing
oop okay
and project manager of course
teamwork
i think we worked great as a team
yeah
yeah
yeah
was good teamwork
i think we are well suited to our roles
yeah
yeah
alright how were our means
um
we needed more play doh colours
yeah
yeah and more play doh 'cause that was all the red we had
yeah
so even if we wanted to make a bigger prototype we wouldn't have been able to
yeah it c it might've been bigger
oh really
okay
but ever
everything else was satisfactory
is that good
yeah
the computer programmes are good
yeah
the
yeah
it could be really straightforward for the computer
yeah
i don't think there was anything
i think the only thing was having to remember to you know to tick the okays but i think i was the only one who struggled with that
yeah
i'm actually not sure if i've saved my presentations
yeah
mm
they'll probably still be there
uh me too
yeah
new ideas found
i don't really know what that means
um
well i think we've all learnt stuff from each other like the n um yeah
yeah
through discussion
just about each different
got new ideas from each other
i'm not sure new ideas found
hmm
yeah well i guess we really it we bounced off of each other which was cool
yeah
yeah
like based on marketing stuff and then you'd say something about interface and yeah worked well
yeah
yeah
and we were a able to modify each other's ideas
mm-hmm
yeah
to fit in with our areas of expertise
yeah
each other's
oh does it have smart materials by the way
sorry
does it have smart materials
mm
oh yeah
oh yeah
well mm did it come into the into i dunno if we counted that in the costs
if if it if it
if it can be afforded
okay
well with that achieved our last slide is our closing slide
yes our costs are within budget
yes
it's evaluated generally positively
mm-hmm
yeah
mm-hmm
and um don't forget to complete final questionnaire and meeting summary
then we celebrate in such a way that i have no idea
uh
by watching t. v.
yay
fantastic
okay brilliant
alright
yeah
thank you very much
okay bye
mm
conclusion
dadada
okay
oh that's not gonna work
oh alright
okay
okay
um alright
uh uh um
i'll just put that there
uh as you all know we're here to create a brand new fantastic remote
uh i'm nick debusk i'm the project manager
uh we'll just get started with everyone kind of letting each other know who they are and what you're doing what your what your role is um
go ahead
okay
i am corinne whiting and i will be the marketing expert and in each of the three phases i will have a different role
in the function design phase i will be talking about user requirement specification
and this means what needs and desires are to be fulfilled and i'll be doing research to figure this out
in the conceptual design phase i will be dealing with trend watching and i'll be doing marketing research on the web
and then finally in the um detailed design phase i will be doing product evaluation and so i will be collecting the requirements and ranking all the requirements to see how we did
'kay
hiya i'm ryan
um i'm the user interface designer
um likewise i've three different roles for each stage of design
um the functional design is looking at the tex technical functions of a remote control
um in the concept design the user interface how the user reacts with the the product
and the detailed design um sort of like the user interface design
what they might be looking for uh things like fashions what makes wha how we're gonna make it special
that's about it
right
i'm manuel and i'm the industrial designer in in this project um
in the functional design phase i'm i'll be dealing mostly with the requirements
um we'll discuss what the prog what functions the the product has to fulfil and so and so on
um i suppose we'll work pretty much together on that one
um um in the conceptual design um i'll be pro mostly dealing with properties and materials um of our product
yeah
and uh the detailed design in the detailed design i'll be concerned with the look and feel of the product itself
um so we're pretty much working together obviously on the design front here
okay
okay
um so we've got our opening our our agenda is the opening uh acquaintance which we've kinda done
uh tool training project plan discussion and then closing
uh grand total of twenty five minutes we have here
um so we are putting together a new remote control
um we want it to be something original
um of course we're a not only a electronics company but a
fashion um conscious electronics company so we want it to be trendy um and we want it to be easy to use
um
we've got the functional design conceptual design and detailed design um which basically is is the three of you um
and
w uh well um functional design um
um do we have um
any ideas of of maybe d let's just throw out some ideas of what kind of remote control we want to have
and then we can go into how we're gonna design it and
and how we're gonna do the detailing on it
yeah
well uh s function of remote control is just just you know change channels is its main function
so we want it to be um a t. v. remote or i i mean do we want it to to do other things besides just be a a television remote
oh right
i suppose you c try make it a universal remote for could work on all sort of electrical
'kay
products in in one person's house
mm
but you know they all sorta have the same role changing channels volumes and then programming
mm-hmm
'kay
i think they all work on the same prin principle as well sorta like i don't actually know
mm
but is it just infra red
is that standard
i i think yeah yeah r universal remote
ye yeah
um this is my first uh go round with creating a remote control so i think we're all in the same boat here
huh
ours too
um
um one thing i thought of with the remote control is you always lose 'em
okay
mm
so if there's a g a way of finding it quite easily i thought that'd be quite good quite a good feature
ch
so we should we should set our remote control up to where it has a uh
like a tracking device
like a tracking device or or like a a
oh you can get those key well you could whistle or make a noise and it'd beep
it makes a noise there's a button on the t. v. that you press and
mm mm
mm
yeah
right
'kay
be good
so
generally all remotes are sort of quite similar in their appearance
yeah
just long
do we want so they're kinda like long and rectangular
yeah
do we want something crazy
black usually
you know we want something new that's gonna stand out
yeah
lot more modern
i think so
a m a modern so our remote should be
maybe sorta spherical or something
a ball
maybe like user friendly like a little
yeah
you know where you can use both hands like a little keyboard type thing
people i thought maybe
mm
because people always tend to throw a remote control about the place to one another if it was in a ball
and maybe the actual controls are inside or something
'kay
mm
um
well there are of course certain restrictions you can't have it be any form and fulfil all functions at the same time
yeah
so there are always the some restrictions we have to apply here
um however um one question is how stable is that thing supposed to be that refers to the material pretty much um
mm
what are we gonna build that thing out of
how sturdy is it gonna be
do we want it to last longer or rather have people
whatever have to buy one every half a year
okay so yeah so we want it to be sturdy we want it to to hold up to somebody's child you know
yeah
throwing it across the room or as you said people kinda throw it
so ball shaped uh you know if it were ball shaped maybe then it
yeah
it could be cased on the outside and t everything could be inside
'kay
um so we want it to be modern fun sturdy
um
so our form and our function
um we want it to be um
easy to find
um
what else
it what else do we want it to to do
so we want it to be universal
it's something that we're supposed to sell for about twenty five euros um
and
you know goals for profits are i think somewhere around uh fifty million euros what they wanna make on it so
mm
also since we're partners of the international remote control association maybe we wanna make it something that would globally appeal
'kay
that's more on the research end but the marketing
so marketing you know how maybe uh
marketing you could s find out what is the most universally um appealing remote control out there
yeah
and maybe as far as design goes maybe we could have different ones for different target audiences
'kay
'cause maybe one won't apply to all of the countries we're targeting
ye
small
right
um
do you guys have any ideas for what it should look like
maybe we could draw it up on the on the board over there
some ideas
we want it to be a b a ball you know we'll draw up we'll draw up the ball and maybe th um where the buttons are located
i'd i could draw sorta the ball idea
my original idea was just simply
sort of a sphere where maybe you
this is where it's connected together and then when you open it out it could fol it could be maybe flip
like a flip phone and then when you fold it out the middle
maybe a hinge that'll have to be the strongest part of it
if that if we did use a hinge or if it was just two parts and then you'd have
just sorta you you you know your buttons
thing is inside i think sometimes remotes have too many buttons so maybe as simple as possible um as few buttons inside as possible
um i dunno what's the idea for
just something maybe if you ha if it had like if some kind of
like light or something or lights around it
it's looking a bit like something out of star wars at the moment though to be fair
but yeah
futuristic
that was that was a sorta simple idea i had and then you know you could about
uh-huh
right it would almost be like a ball
so that was just just an idea i had
i don't know whether anybody else has other ideas
right
one problem you'd get with this design is um the ball is a nice idea because of it's stability really but of course
yeah
since it's a ball it'll roll so we'd have to have it flat on one side at least down here somewhere take away that part
yeah
maybe f yeah
that's one of the big issues
yeah that's g that's a good idea
also also you risk the hinges here
yeah
that's that's um a problem
the idea it didn't have to necessarily be f a hinge that was just one idea though
that's that's interesting of course but that's of course a weak point yeah
yeah
how would we go about um
making you know getting rid of our weak points
what i mean would we just have a flat spot on the bottom of the ball
not to put you on the spot but
e no no uh uh
what did you say your title was again
n n
uh i'm your industrial designer so i b well the point is
you're the the industrial designer
that
well maybe i dunno
the shape is perhaps not the most ideal
okay
as as stable as it is there must be a compromise between um stability and design here so
well i i suppose that things become design
mm-hmm
but i mean i
i was trying to think of like the design of others
i can't think of anything other than a long rectangle for remote maybe small sort of fatter ones
but there's nothing being done sort of out of left field yeah
yeah
it's not new it's not innovative it's you know everybody does long remote because it's easy it's it's stable um
yeah
'kay i'll draw something
so if no go ahead
what
my idea was just to have it be kind of like a
keyboard type shape you know like video games l so
yeah
but maybe i mean that would be kinda big and bulky
we could also try to do the hinge thing so it could like flip out that way
i don't know
that's my idea
i think definitely doing something different
yeah
is a good idea
mm
i mean maybe design something that's sort of like uh i suppose not everybody's everybody's hand's the same but something that would maybe fit in the hand easier
something with a grip
mm
yeah with a grip
yeah
yeah
because even i suppose even with the ball
it still might be hard to it still not the ho easiest thing to hold yeah
it's it might not be the easiest to hold onto um
mm
so perhaps the the joystick the the keyboard idea might work better
like yeah
but then again people like to use one hand to flip and one hand to hold their soda so maybe maybe we
true
yeah
it's d yeah
i think it's definitely got to be a a one handed a one handed job
mm
i feel like i'm just shooting everything down here
that's fine
uh um
you're the boss you're allowed to
well with the one handed design you also have the the problem of the size w 'cause you know from cell phones they can be too small
so if the remote is too small it if it's small it probably looks better but
yeah
yeah
may not be th as functional
so for that there's
okay so unfortunately we've got about five minutes here to come up with our um remote control idea and start rolling with it
so
um we've talked about our experiences with remote control and um we've got a couple ideas um
let's see here
what if we had what if we had not only um say we went with the ball the ball function um
but maybe we give it sort of grips along the side s um to make it easier to hold on to
so
you know um s so it's easier to hold onto that way
yeah
course that'll then remove some of our our ball
unless this unless this part were raised so say the cover flips over and covers that part
so the grip is
no that wouldn't work either um
but if we're gonna make it flat on the bottom then that eliminates our ball anyways
so if it were flat on the bottom and then had the
sorta grips on the side here i guess
um
and then
flat uh
and then we have the problem with the hinge
so if we're flat on the bottom it's not gonna roll away it'll stay where we want
the question is also i dunno d do you really always want to open that thing when you have to use it
mm that's true
it's probably going to lie around opened all the time anyway so i don't know if a lid is a good idea
from stabil stability point of view uh it certainly is
but also you have to face it and take into account the more of these things break by accident uh the more we sell
so it's don't make it too stable uh
so we don't have it flip open
we just have a ball
but then maybe to go back to the to th s something along those things then
to the other design
okay so then we forget the ball
it looks cool
looks cool though
it looks cool but it's really not it's not functional um
yeah
uh functional
so we've got our sort of keyboard kind
what if we flipped it around here so that it were um
sorry that doesn't look anything like what you had there
um so it's up and down you hold it this way
course then it's it's like the rectangular again only with a couple of jutting out points
yeah
right
right
but it's one handed um
question is what makes those game pads functional
w i think that's pretty much the form for full hand
so it's a round shape underneath that makes it comfy right makes it nice so that's the essential part
mm
yeah
except for that i think we'll not probably not get a get away from some longer design
yeah
right
'cause you also have to know which way around to point this thing
yeah because it doesn't have a cord like joysticks do
you know all that dif batteries right and
batteries go weak as well so um after a while you have to point it towards the uh
towards the equipment you wanna control with it right
so have to m
show which is the front which is the back
is it possible to have it to where it would work with a like a sensor on either side
so that either way you're pointing it it would work
i suppose you could do that
o of course the more technology you stick in that the more it'll cost so
more expensive and yeah
course you can do that
'kay
um
i mean of course it'll be evident after a while or if you look at it it'll it'll be evident which way around to point it
since you have the the numbers and the and the the buttons and stuff
true
but um it's rather about an instinctual thing
put it
like you just grab it you don't have to s look at it you know which way around to point it
otherwise the design of or the the point of putting two sensors on both sides um would probably work
even if you designed it in some in a way that you know isn't a rectangle but still pointed in a direction that had definite points
so if that's your thing and you got something like that instead and there's your s you kn you know which way you're gonna pointing it
yeah
'kay
sorry to interrupt but we have a warning to finish
um
are we out of time
yeah
mm
okay well just to finish up should we s go with this plan start making some
are good ideas what are not
let's
does it say what does it say for n it says on there what we need to do for the next meeting i think
obviously
uh
must finish now so
t
and then marketing will look and see what uh what people want
mm
alright
great
okay
and project manager will design a better meeting for next time around be a little bit more prepared
and uh alright good meeting
oh
du
okay
thanks for coming to this meeting
hm
s how we doing on our remote
we have some we have some ideas and some uh
ideas for what people want
uh we yes s i've lo i've done the role that i was asked to do anyway
yeah
i think
alright let's just go over the agenda real quick for this meeting
see if i can't get things uh moving along here a little bit better
um i'll go over what we went over last time which shouldn't take long
then i believe each of you have a presentation
um i've was sent a a couple more requirements for our remote what they want
um then we can come to a conclusion on uh what we want the remote to do um and how it's going to do it hopefully
and uh then we'll have the closing
um which we'll have forty minutes for
uh let's see the last meeting we went over um
who was responsible for what
i'm responsible for leading the meetings keeping the notes uh and coming up with the final presentation
um corinne is our marketing expert
she's gonna figure out what what um the consumer wants
um ryan is our user interface designer
and manuel is the industrial designer
so you're gonna come up with the ideas ryan and you're gonna pick 'em apart
um we decided our remote uh we want it to be a universal remote uh that everyone would want
um we want to be modern um fun different
uh it needs to be sturdy um easy to find so we gonna have that locator function
um and we want to be different
um and then we went over a couple of different ideas
ball shaped phone
the keyboard shape
um we decided that it should probably be one handed
something we could use with one hand
um and that was our last meeting
so um why don't um do each of you have a presentation
yep
okay
i'll hand it off to you and um
does anyone do you wanna go first
sure
so we can maybe see what uh what the people want
what was it
function
eight
f. eight
f. eight
well
how do i get it
slide show
to go to the next one
oh right right right
yeah you click on that guy
that one
yeah
okay
alright
well this is my report which is going to be based pretty much on a survey that i was sent
oh gosh i've no idea
g
just press the arrow keys i think
usually goes to it
okay
sorry i actually need
to see something else on my screen
hit f. eight again
yeah
i think
and then
again
yeah
you want it to be on both screens or just just yours
no i want something else on mine
is that possible
yeah but i think you have to hit escape
and then you can
yeah
okay but now you don't have that
oh hit f. eight again
sorry guys
i know
i did the same thing
and then it should come up
here shortly
'kay
so is there no way i can give you the slideshow and
i think oh give us the slideshow and something on your screen
have something yeah
yeah
oh well
mm
i'm not sure
you could maybe minimise that screen and then
yeah
have them both up at the same time i think
it's okay
okay
um so first of all the method that i used was by doing some marketing research by um doing research on some interviews that were conducted
and then some internet research
and i was sent a report that was i think there were a hundred remote users that they interviewed
and so i will show you some of the results from that which i think will be helpful
um okay here are some of the findings
they said that the users dislike the look and feel of their current remote controls
and seventy five percent of the users find their remote controls to be ugly
which is a fairly significant number i would say
and eighty percent of the users would be willing to spend more money if they could get a remote that would look fancy
so i think that earlier we were onto something when we were talking about having it be a modern cool look i think that's definitely important
um they say that current remote controls do not match well the operating behaviour of the user
seventy five percent of users said they zap a lot
and if anyone could clarify what that means
zap does that just mean like changing the channel
is is it j just just just using it yeah
just jus yeah
okay
um and fifty percent of the users say that they're only using ten percent of the buttons on their remote control
and there was something else they kept track of the frequency per hour in using certain buttons
and some of them it looks like barely need to be included at all
of course channel selection is used the most frequently
and then teletext was the next
volume and then power
and then audio settings and screen settings and channel settings were practically never used
so i think we could definitely eliminate or somehow combine a lot of the functions into one button
um the biggest user frustrations as we said fifty percent of people find that their remotes are lost somewhere
and so i think a tracking device of some sort would be a good idea
they said it take thirty four percent said it takes too much time to learn how to use a new remote
and twenty six percent said that the controls are bad for r. s. i.
a repetitive strain injury
what is it
just repetitive strain injury
i think
okay
that's what i guess
okay
and so bas okay
um as far as speech recognition goes um the younger group looks like they're all for it
from the fifteen to twenty five age group over ninety percent said they would pay more
and it kind of just went down incrementally
the groups at the older they get it looks like the less willing they are to pay
so maybe we could discuss this and think and decide if we think it's worth investing in this
at least if we're targeting the younger groups
and so in conclusion
some things that i drew from this are that i think we were correct
we definitely need to focus on a new modern appearance since so many people seem to be concerned about the ugliness of their remote control
um a multifunctional remote could be a good thing to explore
so you only have one rather than five different remotes sitting all over your room
uh we need to simplify the remote and reduce the number of buttons get rid of the ones that don't seem to be serving much purpose
and then lastly i thought that maybe we could discuss the idea of speech recognition
and that's it
'kay
very nice
now we actually have some ideas of what what people want what we should focus on
uh
wait can i look at that real quick
oh yeah
sorry did you guys get time to write everything that you needed
yeah
'kay
having just listened to what corinne just said i'll draw on some of the things as well
some things that sort of relevant to what i wanna say
'kay so i'm just gonna yeah approach the technical functions design
um the method i used was to explore the uh technical functions of a remote control
and t s simplest approach that i came to is is to change programme and operate an electronic device remotely
i mean that's an obvious thing to say but it's not attached to the device that you want to control
um i had some things sent to me
not very much
to look at similar devices
um defined in some them
and then the personal preferences that i will suggest
um we discussed a universal one
um like it's just been brought up again then
but i think a universal remote control is actually quite a difficult object to design
and po possibly within maybe the budget that we do it um because you'd need to know all the spef specifications of a all the like electronic companies
i'm not sure have you ever come across a universal remote control yourself
but you have to i they're a nightmare to use
you have to set them reset them to everything
um and that would only add buttons
whereas i think the aim is to take away buttons
so i think it'd be better maybe to concentrate on maybe just a universal one for t. v. s
um or maybe just one that you could we could design and then different people
manufacturers could use it to set to their specifications if if the aim is to get something that's unique in design
um
okay here here's just two pictures of remote controls
they're just simple t. v. remote controls
but one is uh user centred
that is the one on the left
and you can straight away see there's less buttons
and the other one is engineer centred where that's more uh specified for the sort of the elaborate piece of equipment it's trying to control um
which appeals more to the product that we want and on what the have said and the market research and stuff probably looking at something that should be user centred
fewer buttons simpler to use and if ten percent um is hidden away if ten percent is what's used
maybe the other fifty percent the buttons that are used very rarely like programming
they could be hidden maybe under some remote controls you might have come across have maybe a little flip thi thing where they're hidden away
and the main buttons are the ones you or the ones you come across
um and finally um uh sort i've sort of covered that our product i think should be user interface orientated
um
like i said to concentrate on t. v. remote control a universal remote might be too complex
um and as what it the major findings market researchers have said it's the image and the appearance that people di dislike
so that we should concentrate on something that would set a trend
and then and change the fashion of remote controls
and that's it
cable there
thank you
what was your last conclusion on that one
focus on uh the i
on something on the image of it
the image of it
uh the f the actual design
'kay
good
good
okay
gonna talk to you about the working design of the interiors basically which is what dictates the design the both the interface basically and the outer appearance because this is all the stuff that needs to go in there
right
so unfortunately the people who were supposed to
do this little presentation for me obviously were too drunk to actually accomplish it so um i'm going to do a lot of the stuff on the board
um just
this is the basic
basic premise of a remote control
um the basic function is to send messages to another system
okay so much is clear
an energy source feeds an integrated circuit like a chip that can compose messages
often in the form of infrared bits
this is the most mostly used
um there's uh also some sound systems but infrared is
the better or the more more used system
um parts are cheaper as well
a user interface controls the chip and accordingly the messages
this is where my people screwed up basically
so i'm going to explain that on the board rather
um what we have is different components that obviously need to go in there
we'll start with an energy source
right
um which is usually a battery right
since it's not feasible to add a cable to that
this energy source of course is connected to
the
the user interface itself
uh which can be buttons whatever which in fact
controls a chip
right
this is the user interface and there we have the chip
um the way this goes normally is that this chip then controls an infrared lamp
that sends out the signal
of course the signal differs accordingly
um depending on what the chip tells the infrared lan lamp
and
of course that's controlled the chip itself is controlled by the user interface
the way you normally normally do it is that you add a little device such as a lamp
to the whole thing as well so that you know that it's working basically
you press something you get a response
which is also comparatively um important on one of those devices
now this what we're talking about here or what i think should be discussed are these two components mostly
the
the uh energy source for one thing can be altered
what we probably cannot alter is of course the infrared the sending device basically the infrared lamp
we cannot change the chip which controls the infrared lamp
right
these two are components that we have to use and these are dictated by the whole function of the whole thing
um the lamp can be put onto the desi the device
it c it doesn't have to be there
this can be discussed as well
the user interface
that's something we can also discuss
um as we've heard
uh speech recognition is the hype obviously in the moment
speech recognition um interface we don't know that
or if we just do the usual button thing
or we have a touch pad or something like that that's something we can discuss
and of course the energy source
batteries
solar cells
who knows
of course it's always a question whether these these components are in fact available cheap enough developed enough
but that's like i s i suppose rather up to marketing and not to
so we could the the the more complex we make it of course the more expensive
to the industrial design department
expensive it's gonna be get uh
yeah
but people have said that they would well younger generations of people have said that they would pay more for a speech recognition remote
mm-hmm
so
right
possibly it might be worth the investment
i think speech recognition was
uh one of those things where um they have to be really good for them to work
'cause sometimes you find yourself just saying things over and o if it's on your phone
yeah
i agree
and you need to sort of take into light languages and then different dialects i suppose as well
well
i myself i find when you h when there's something like spee speech recognition
like uh you call on the phone and you try to change your telephone or power or something
sometimes they have a a speech recognition on the other end and you say one for this
yeah
and you find yours like you said saying the same thing over and over and over
i find myself especially if i'm in a crowd of people looking really silly
yeah
so maybe if you're sitting on your couch with a bunch of people then
and wou i don't know if would would you want to keep saying stuff if you were watching stuff
you know you
if you were watching something would you sort of be wanting
volume up
volume down
yeah
change the channel you know channel up channel down
i i don't know
another thing about these figures is ninety one percent of the youngest age groups said they'd do it but probably a lot of them that's actually their parents money
like i don't know if they would actually go out and purchase this themselves a fifteen year old you know
i think
as well it'd be j the gimmick factor for the younger people
mm-hmm
yeah
but practically i don't think it's
it's a it's a gimmick factor that they like at first and
yeah
it'll wear off
gets old yeah
okay
um
let's see here
do you wanna put your cord back in
yeah i guess so
oh right
trade you
go
now i was sent a couple of
things to modify our uh new requirements
um the remote's only gonna be for the television
which is good because we already decided y your your research showed that uh not only is a universal remote more complicated
it's more cost more costly
and your re uh research showed that you know most of the people don't even use it
i think uh you said fifty percent of the people only use half the or ten percent of the buttons
mm
so if we remove the universal remote then that solves that problem
um no teletext
um
so we don't have to worry about that
um but we do have to use the the company wants us to incorporate the corporate colour and our slogan which is we put the fashion in electronics
and our corporate colours are grey and yellow
and we could probably get away with black too but
so those are the three um the three new requirements that that i was told
we need to use
um from all all three of your uh presentations i think that we were on the right track a lot in our last meeting
um
we want something that looks good
um we want something that's simple
we want something that you can find easily
um
and the speech recognition i i guess is kind of uh give or take
it's gonna cost more
s the young the younger people say that they like it
mm-hmm
but um it's
probably i would say probably not worth the investment at this point in time
so maybe we should just do away with speech recognition
um
and that way we can focus on our form
i did have have a thought about the sort of the tracking thing
is that if it came with maybe a holder
or holster whatever you wanna call it
um that you you should put it back in
your remote
but if you don't put it back in you press something like a little button on that
and that just sort of sends out a beep to find where it is or something
just by infrared
that shouldn't be too complex i would've thought
that'd be that'd be good if we were going with our our ball
yeah it would be quite good
the ball could sit on a
or or with you know i guess with any form that that would be good
mm
you know that could be the charger
for you know we could use rechargeable batteries in the remote
yeah
and that would be or solar
or you know however however you wanted to go about it the holder could also be the charging unit
yeah
um
with the locator button
um and if it were the ball you'd no longer have to have a flat space on it
yeah
um like if we still have the how to hold on to it and
well you still do
you s you still
w yeah
you put it on t on the couch table
rolls away yeah
while you're watching it's gonna roll off
it's gonna roll away
so that's not an issue really
um
so i guess after the meeting we'll have some questionnaires
and uh
and some summaries for for what's going on
um then we'll take lunch
then we can come back and uh work on our individual work
um
i'll do the minutes
uh let's see
it looks like you're already on your way for uh
working with the components
um chips the what chips we need and what uh
you know how to power it and whatnot
user interface concept we want it to be something simple
yeah
um
minimal number of buttons
i guess our i guess our main um
main thing that we should focus on until then is probably deciding on a certain look you know
yeah
right
that's
did you have time earlier to to work on that
did you guys feel you have enough time in between our meetings to get everything done that you need to get done
not really
i'll yeah i'll have a look try look at the actual appearance in the next break
'kay
i th i i do still think it needs to be something that is ultimately one handed
the ball is probably not a good idea
mm
and even something that's held like that might be difficult
mm-hmm
so that i think it still has to be a variation
on maybe a
a rect on a rectangle but maybe not necessarily as
boring as plain as a rectangle
mm
um
shall we maybe shoot for a a specific uh target group
that way we could l i mean
if it were if we were shooting for young guys then it's um a certain look to the remote
or girls or older people
um
would that you think that would help us find um a specific form
that we would would wanna pick out
d i don't know if that might cope with like the trend watching
mm
i find anything more on that
yeah not yet but maybe by the next meeting we'll have some info on that
'kay
so
um we know that the remote's gonna have to be we'll just say we've got a colour scheme for it
yeah
um yellow and you know yellow it's nice and bright with the buttons being grey or black
mm
and our slogan pasted somewhere on it on the the bottom or the you know
bottom perhaps yeah
um
maybe we could sketch a so basically
all of our remotes all of our typical remotes now are just kind of a rectangular sort
you know
um maybe we could flare it or something
you know
so it's more of course this will look like a bone then
go ahead and erase this
um
hope everyone memorised that uh
you i mean it might be to look at sort of the the shape and trend of like things like mobile phones
and the shapes that the they've been going
yeah
mm
yeah
they've gone from big brick block things which is a remote control is to sort of slinky small things
yeah everybody's got a mobile phone right
except for me now
uh
but they are all you know mobile phones um they've kind of taken a turn to where they're really small
yeah
um which may defeat our purpose for being able to locate our remote all the time
mm
right
but then again you don't want you know like the first mobile phone that was this big and you had a handbag to carry it around in
um
so we've got basically what
remotes look like now is kind of what we're
what we're stuck with
um
maybe we could go with a square or something
um
hm
um you know with minimal number of buttons
i guess you've got you know one through nine
for typing in your channels
uh you've got
volume up and down
channel up and down
power
power
usually at the top
um a mute
that's the classical design
that's that's pretty much all you need i think
um
a menu button maybe
right
so you know
if you
if we want the remote to do other things like um or i guess the t. v. to be able to change the tint and the colour and you know all those kind of things that are built into t. v. s
we just have that under one standard menu button where you go in press the menu button scroll up and down to select it
yeah
yeah
um
talking of which maybe a scrolling function is not not too bad
'kay so
it's
talk about maybe f look at that from the side there maybe
um
which is technically the easiest option
would probably be like a scrolling little scrolling wheel like this
mm-hmm
yeah
yeah
yeah
like a wheel on your mouse
so
yeah sort of like that
sort of
you can even
if we're coming from mice we can even add a click function where you in order to verify the information you just press it down
right
's a good idea
also when it comes to the ergonomics of the whole thing if you wanna make it square for the looks of it
then maybe to make it more comfortable to hold the whole thing you add a little bulge down here
just which maybe from an engineering point this could be holding the the batteries and so on
mm-hmm
i know
you know what i'm getting at here fel look at it from the side
look g yeah
mm-hmm
looks good
it's like that
right
uh
then you hold it in your hand like this
and maybe you bring the buttons nearer to the or the imp more important buttons nearer to the to the side
yes s
to the thumb
to the thumb yeah
yeah
right
mm
maybe the buttons could like uh
decrease in s the bigger ones you know they could actually be bigger in size than the ones that are less important the smaller here
right
you can also have it maybe talking about mobile phones again sliding open
yeah
with the lesser used functions on this part and then it slides into that part
behind
definitely
just like o on a sort of side view
and out
something that you know it would sort of fit in the hand better
so you know you just sort of have your hand
mm well i was just thinking this this of course causes
yeah
right on the and your thumb would be up here type thing
causes a problem um for left or right handed people actually
yeah that's also true
so
instantly sort of always going for the right handed person
right
but i mean the older so
yeah is everyone who in here's right handed left handed
right
you guys all right handed
right
right handed yeah
yeah
so i'm left handed but i so i can say that most things are designed for right handed people
uh-huh
that's right
like the written language
or english
maybe you could buy like a special left handed version of the remote
maybe
ow
special order
i would say i mean it should be probably designed for a right handed p person
yeah
um but that's that's good
that's w i think we've got a kind of a good plan there
um
at least for what buttons we're gonna use
um
so we've got uh
i like the scroll the scroll action and the
i mean i'm just just thinking maybe
if it was um
circular
um
with the sort of that sort of the sort of early idea we had with the way that was more like that
whereas this is just a one handed thing that you sort of almost wrap round the thumb
so you'd have your you'd put your hand into there with the thumb there
and then your thumb would do you'd have all the buttons sort of round here
and that i think could work
yeah
on any hand
kinda like holding a
if you just had it like wrapped round there
left or right
mm
right
that minimises it size wise as well
minimise its size
it could be you know really quite small
mm
then there's maybe
another point of making it a two in one kind of thing
if we have a smaller
a smaller device that actually fits into the big one
you give it the full functions in here and just a couple of functions in there
yeah
hmm
like your zap zapping device is just u channels up down uh volume and on off
zapping functions
that's it
could be good
yeah
maybe
so two remotes in one
but then would be easier to lose
one or the other
that's right
means the big one has to be sufficiently big
and perhaps heavy so you can't move it around
yeah yeah
it actually is your coffee table
make it a piece of furniture
yes
yes there you go
or a statue or something
okay
well we need to finish up here
um
so for the next
so for the next um before the next meeting w uh sh shall we work on you're watching trends to see what what kind of new information we've got going on
mm-hmm
yep
um
manuel you're going to work on the components for for what we're gonna use
right
let's go with our our uh rounded
kind of fit in your hand let's explore uh the the uh possibility of having the two piece
so one for the the quick zapping um and possibly one you know with just that rounded part that fits into your hand
alright
yeah
um
and ryan you work on um how how well they'll work with the us with the user
how well it'll work yeah
so both of those concepts
and uh okay i think we made some good progress here
alright
see you in
i dunno
i gu i guess we'll take lunch
in about uh half an hour
or i guess we'll be taking lunch shortly and then then in about half an hour after that we'll probably have another meeting
yeah
alright
okay
okay
right
okay
alright
is everyone here
yep
yep
okay
this is our conceptual design meeting
and
i'll just take a few minutes and uh go through the previous minutes
um then each of you will have your presentation um and then we will need to make a decision on the concept for the remote control
and then we'll have uh forty minutes for finishing up
um
i'll go through the mee through the minutes first
um we just refreshed our our uh goal of making the finest remote control available
um we decided that or we know that we need to use company colours company logo
um and
our marketing expert uh gave us some i uh information from interviews with a hundred different remote users
um with some statistics that backed basically what we were thinking before
people thought their remotes were ugly um
um
that remotes zap a lot
um they only use uh a finite amount of buttons
um and that they often lose the it's easy to lose a remote
um which were all things we were thinking we would wanna make it simple
um
and uh some sort of locator
either a button or tracking device
um
and that it should look different than what's out there
um
kind of mixed mixed response on the speech recognition
the younger people said they wanted it older people did not
um uh i think we decided that
um the expense was not necessarily worth it and that it was probably a gimmick that um would increasingly wear on the consumers' nerves
um
then the user interface designer um explored some of the technical functions of the remote
um the simple versus the um the complex
the simple one being better for a user the complex better for an engineer
um
um and some personal preferences that were found in that would be that it should be a user oriented remote something simple
um and that we didn't wanna go with a universal remote because uh increasing cost and increasing complexity
um we would just have a t. v. remote
um and that we should also focus on the appearance of the remote
have it s be something that looks different
and finally our um industrial designer uh gave us a rundown of how the remote will work
um from energy source um uh what we would use
batteries because we don't wanna have a a cable
um
how that would power the remote and the lamp
if we were to to have one
uh um the user interface then would connect to a chip which would work with the infrared controls uh to send the signal to the t. v.
um
i believe then we came up with a couple of ideas for what we think the design of the remote will be
um
um something that will fit into uh easily into someone's hand
and with a just a few buttons
just the basics
and with a scrolling um function also
okay and i will leave that leave it at that
so
marketing
okay
we're watching trends
yep
can i have your cable please
i suppose that you can have this
thanks
okay so i was looking at trend watching
um unfortunately i wasn't given too much information
i was given a brief executive summary and then an update on some recent fashion trends that we might like to look at
and then i'll just tell you some personal preferences that i got from that
um okay the most important finding was that the fancy look and feel seems to be twice as important to the users as the current functional look and feel design
which i think we've kind of already discussed before
um the second most important finding was that the remote should be technologically innovative
and again these are all things we've kind of already come up with on our own but this just backs it up
and thirdly the remote would be easy to use
as far as fashion update we've learned that fruits and vegetables will be the most important theme for cloths shoes and furniture
so that might be a bit of a challenge to incorporate this into our remote but we can try
um and also as opposed to last year this year the material is expected to be spongy in feel
okay so from that um as we've already said we need to focus on a fancy look and feel
um i think we've already discovered that it's kind of hard to go away from the traditional rectangular design
but i think that even if it's very subtle we need to kind of trick our consumers
so they at least get the idea that they're getting something that's new and modern and sleek and
whether it's through the shape or the colours or all of that
um for technologically innovative we've talked about the tracking device
we brought up the idea of having two pieces which we could discuss further
and manuel had suggested um the energy source and the user interface discussing some of those um that we could change a little bit
we need to keep it simple have limited buttons which i think the two piece idea might be really beneficial for
um we need to incorporate this fashion trend of fruits and vegetables
i don't know i mean i guess the two options are if we had our remote in the shape of a fruit or vegetable
a banana shape
oh it was sort of banana shaped
yeah
yeah
right
or with exterior designs
but my question is i mean the stereotypically speaking you kind of picture males with their remote controls
and i'm not sure how they'd feel about having fruity logos on the outside
so maybe we could have something that's somewhat removable or i don't know different options for female male target groups
and then the spongy feel
i guess we could look at mobile phones and other technology that's out there
c and look at different types of material that might please our users who want spongy feeling remote controls
so that's that
so possibly like a uh sorry just to butt in for a second
alright
possibly uh like a cover like they have for mobile phones
that's what i was thinking yeah
those like yeah sort of spongy ones
you have one with a flag and one with a banana and one that's a spongy
yeah
so when you buy your remote you can buy
feel to it
you can
various coverings
mm various covers
what's it called
cust you personalised yeah
personalise your remote
we could leave that to the cover department
mm-hmm
yeah
we all know they've got nothing to do all day
okay
why can't i see the crazy
um yeah i talking about the interface concept and how the customer relates to will use the consumer will use the actual device
um so i've looked at some of the stuff i was sent um try and get some inspiration
but keep in mind that our own ideas that we had
um i was sent some information from the company saying that they
the technology department have devised a new speech recognition technology where you can program questions into such devices
they gave an example of a coffee machine where you program a question you program the answer and the machine responds accordingly
um okay
there's different ways of a user can use products l like a remote
um there's a graphical use where you you look at pictures and
well on a screen
a command line where you obviously type things in and you get a response
um and then it ju that's just to point out the sort of inconsistent u sort of use of interface in remotes
you can't really see that picture well but there's various different remotes once again with lots of different buttons on making it more complicated
so then i had a look at new products that are on the market
not necessarily remote controls but ones that you'll recognise
um this is the voice there is a voice recognition remote control which can control mus multiple devices
i have a there is a picture
you surf your favourite channels uh with your voice
store up to eighty speech samples controls four devices t. v. cable satellite v. c. r. d. v. d. and audio
and you can record your own v verbal labels that are connected to remote control functions
so the technology is there
um the one on the left is very similar to what we drew up on the board in the previous meeting
where there has scroll down functions on the side
you can sort of just make those out
and then on the right is obviously an ipod which is you know possibly one of the simplest things to use out there
and really is and all that is is just a a nice big scroll menu that y you sort of go through
that is a
possibility
and nothing's simpler really
um then there's things like this which is a a a kid's remote
where the the parents have the facility to control and program what children can watch before
so the remote control it o only allows them to access the channels that their parents want them to watch
and um it means that th children have a novelty of having their own remote control
so i don't know if there's a possibility of having one remote contr you know like we just had two components
maybe it can have more components you know different remotes
um the point made at the end there here is that you have to be sort of be need to be clear on your um devices
as to what you know things you use
sometimes an arrow pointing down which may suggest volume down could become confused just as a v. for volume
just little things like that which would need to be made clear in the design
um i think d carrying on from what i've already said a user friendly remote with minimum buttons
maybe we've so suggested this two part thing
where if it was to have a speech recognition thing you could maybe control that on the do it or program all that on the control bit
and then just have the simple sort of hand held thing that we sort of devised earlier as the actual remote
um i don't it could be a graphical display
the actual remote contr the actual control port maybe could have like an ipod where you just sort of control through the menus
stuff like gets more and more compli complicated
and then the the hand held bit should be ergonomically designed
and that is it
why am i
oh yeah
just
where are we
uh
just to sort of show you
m they've even got things like that
huge things
which is just for your gr ninety year old grandma yeah
that's industrial design for cranes stuff like that
yeah
yeah
notice the giant dog bone shape
dunno
and that yeah
makes sense makes sense
also good for animals
yeah
see
things
why's my screen crazy
uh
well let's see
i'm going to bore you with a
couple of descriptions of the interior
just to to make it more obvious what we have to fit in there and that we do have to fit the stuff in there
i've more information on possible materials um as well
what we can and cannot do
um but let's just wait for this to load up and i'll show you
what we're talking about here
okay
the details of the components' design as you can see there what we have is the board main board of the remote control
the underside that's pretty cheap piece of of technology really top left side you can see the chip
which is the what we were talking about this was is the device to recognise the signals the input
and it passes it on to a row of um further transistors and stuff like that on the right side that actually amplify the signal
which later on is being is being transferred to a infrared lamp which
then um of course shines infrared light onto the television which then will recognise what signal um it's getting and will do what you tell it
um
so much for the the workings of the
of the uh
remote control itself
its job is to wait for you to press a key then to translate that key press into infrared light signals um that are received by the television
when you press a key um you complete a specific connection
the chip senses the connection and knows what button you pressed
it produces a morse code line signal specific to that button
right
pretty clear
transistor amplifies the signal and then sends the m sends the signal to the l. e. d. which translates the signal into infrared light
the sensor in the t. v. can see the infrared light and seeing the signal reacts appropriately
this is the circuit board from the other side
um the lower part of it i don't know if you can see that properly
with the green greenish board is is what we what we saw in the first the first slide just flipped over
um you can see the circuit board itself
that's the cheapest uh way to make electronic connections basically on the market
um what you do is you have don't have cables but you have the connections actually in these in these lines on the on the board
these are the actual keys that are being pressed
they close the electric circuit
that then sends the signal to the chip on the other side
that would be behind here
um which uh sends it over to the transistors and all that stuff that
amplify the signal and all that is being sent to the infrared lamp up there
now as you can see this is the the rubber button version of it
um the way it works is that you have the keys here
the rubber button has a little metal uh plate on the other side which closes the circuit here
and thus gives on the signal
now this is the simple version
um we are talking um this this the simple and cheapest version at the same time
we are talking something more complicated of course it's going to be more expensive as well
and not only that
um we are also restricted in the use of our outer shell or in the material that we could use for our outer shell
um i've gotten some information that
we could use for the case material plastic
rubber as well
um rubber that is used in these anti stress balls
so it's pretty squishy
spongy
that would that would serve that purpose
um we could also use wood or titanium
what's the approximate per hundred thousand for the titanium
oh fya i don't have an information on that
however our company obviously can provide us with uh with the titanium so i assume i'm i was given an okay to use it
it certainly is an expensive material i'm aware of that but i was given an okay
but there are certain restrictions to certain materials
now let's first go through the list with the materials
so we what we can use is plastic rubber wood and titanium
can also mix these
um as for the energy source um we were talking about that shortly in the other meeting
um what we could use is or what i was offered or what we could use is a basic bateer battery
right
uh a dynamo
interestingly enough
um we could use solar cells
or a device that was not n not further specified that provides kinetic energy
such as like watches you know
where you just move them
m move the the actual device and this pr uh provides it with with uh some energy
so um obviously
i personally have to say that dynamo is out of the question really
mm
you don't wanna wind up your remote control before you can use it right
um solar cell is interesting
may fail though every here and there
would you have to leave it by the window
mm
yeah
yeah
or you know you lose it it lies behind the couch for a week and yeah mm
yeah
always the you
works well in arizona but in edinburgh not so
but exactly
y probably not yeah
yeah
um the kinetic energy thing um might work um but the same problem
you leave it lying around and you first have to shake it before it it starts to work
so i'd say what we're stuck with really is um the basic battery
which also makes a base station basically obsolete
we don't need that then
um
however
our interface options are push buttons
in which uh in the production of which or in manufacture of which um our company is expert
um
however we've discussed that scroll wheels are a better option
and they are possible
we have an okay for scroll wheels
okay
um however when it comes to the scroll wheel of the ipod
i've one big objection and that is that we have to fit an l. c. d. into the remote control as well
this however may exclude certain um materials
if you have a squishy uh kind of remote control then an l. c. d. screen may be affected by the movement
hence we might not be able to put it in there
so um
there's also restrictions to when it comes to the chip
if we have a more sophistic uh sophisticated scroll wheel rather than this very basic uh set up that we that i've just presented
um the chip has to be more s more sophisticated and thus more expensive as well
i don't have any details to when it comes to the cost but um it will be a significant difference
i'd rather say drop the titanium and therefore let's have a more sophisticated chip but that's not up to me to decide really
so that's for the for the scroll wheel
um it limits our choice and squishy is hip so i'd say
rather not go for for that
let's see now
um um solar cells cannot be used on a curved or latex um surface or um remote control
but obviously that's not our problem um since we have decided or against solar cells i assume right
mm
or is anybody still alright
yeah
no i think i think batteries are probably the way to go
no
hmm
alright
yeah
uh which makes it very conventional but therefore traditional i assume
um
um
with the titanium um we cannot make it a curved design
we would just be able to make it flat and
and um yeah a straight design pretty much
which i assume would exclude uh some of the more sophisticated versions
would the sort of spongy and the the plasticky thing y you can get those mobile phones that initially have a it is plastic but then they have sort of a a s a cover on it which is just sort of soft and stuff
mm
like a covering
yeah
so i don't know if that would still be possible to have you know in plastic
but then where do people hold it
just all be sort of spongy
yeah
the we can have the fruits and vegetables on the spongy parts so they can remove it
so you as the the possibility of having a a graphical display on it like a screen
like the ipod
you can have an l. c. d. screen
um but therefore no rubber will be used
right
alright
so plastic yes titanium yes but this will of course influence the form
with plastic as i understand it you can use any form
um latex
is tricky
or rubber and um
and titanium also seems to be tricky when it comes to the form
so the way to go is if you want a scroll wheel you either make it flat and angular uh add an l. c. d. screen and um
then you can basically choose either plastic or titanium
yeah
or wood even
um if you wanna make it a particular shape use plastic
add an l. c. d. screen add a scroll wheel that'll be fine
yeah
or make it just push buttons
basically plastic gives you the b biggest variety of of options
maybe not the nicest feel
or not much originality really
so the ru wait the rubbery we can shape it however we want
or the rubbery we cannot
with rubber we could uh sh pretty much shape it the way we wanted it but we cannot add scroll wheels and we cannot add an l. c. d. screen
'kay
mm
mm
mm
that's the tricky thing
could we not you know have a shape with a scroll and the screen
and then j just sort of that initial shape we had just which is uh sort of banana esque
so that's thing if we did it yellow
yeah
and um you know you just p stick on just sort of rubber things that that sort of grip the thumb bit
they wouldn't have any they're just on the exterior
they wouldn't be necessary to the actual shape of the thing
is that an option a plastic shell with a rubbery coating on at certain spots
s certainly can be done yes
um yeah
if that doesn't affect the functional side of it all
yeah
like say just the underside or so then it can be done
i assume
yeah
so
the fruit design um
how about um affecting the surface of the actual um remote control
say we don't make it p a particular fruit shape obviously but uh give it like the surface of
mm
an orange banana whatever
you name it
mm
what about a smell
just design wise
t to the remote
mm
nice one
you could just sell it in different colours as well i suppose
in different ye yellows
bright citrus colours yeah
mm
i don't suppose we have to stick to co
well we we're supposed to stick to the company colours though that's yellow and grey
stick to the colours yeah
oh yeah
yellow and grey
yellow and grey
so what have we lemon banana is
mm grapefruit
grapefruit
grapefruit is what we'd go for when it comes to the outer appearance perhaps
but mm
i would say if i were to make a decision i would probably put the fruit aspect at the lower lower end of the spectrum of of importance
yeah
um
i think having a shape could be a little ridiculous like
yeah
well we have it banana shaped already kind of
well we kinda do yeah
yeah
so
well perhaps the implied shape will be enough to lure that fruit minded remote buyer
yeah
and if it's yellow
and if it if it was done yellow which is a company colour
right
it's it's yellow
i it's yellow
it's curved
grey buttons yeah
well so why not add a couple of grey stripes and make it look like a banana
it's sort of couple of couple of grey stripes
yeah
we could put the grey stripes on the bottom so that that person could turn it over
on the the gr the rubbery grips could be grey
it would look like a banana just sitting on their table
mm
yeah
there you go
rather than rather th
it could and then you could actually h put the banana shaped thing on the fruit bowl
oh
on the coffee table and then people would always know where it was
maybe the holder if we were to have a holder it could be shaped like a fruit
nice
could look like a fruit bowl
it could be an ape
could be it could be an ape or a fruit bowl
yeah
hey we could have a variety of options here
yeah
'kay
yeah
do you have more to your presentation
that's pretty much it
i informed you about the materials what the interior has to look like and what the limitations to certain materials are on there you go
oh
okay
i'm gonna plug in here real quick
sure
if i could
hang on
there you go
like i said we have to make a decision on
a couple of these items here
um ow
ow
so is the two piece idea out
or have we not decided
well we sort of
rid of that because gonna use a battery
and the base station might not be necessary
oh right okay
well we can still design a two piece uh remote um without having a base having one of them be a base station
yeah
yeah
but just have it be an optional either big remote with lots of functions or you take out the smaller piece
mm
we can still do that
however of course this would be like designing two remotes pretty much
mm-hmm
so um which then as i understand it would probably limit the
limit again the the the use of certain materials because they would be too expensive
say like have a scroll wheel and uh on both of them or have an l. c. d. screen and so on so on
mm
you'd probably have to stick rather with a just traditional rubber button
design which we saw there
mm
but could be done of course
okay
uh so these are the decisions that we do need to make by the end of this meeting
um for our components concept we need to come up with the energy source um the chip on print and the case
probably case um material
and probably a shape also
um and then for the user interface concept we need to decide what the tape what what the type is
and what kind of supplements we'll have
um
energy source i think we've i think we've decided batteries although not exciting are probably our best bet
right
and we have five minutes
okay when it comes to the chip on print as i said the the more advanced features you want
um the fancier the chip has to be and the more expensive
uh if you want just a normal button version the chip on print is gonna be
mm
a cheap one
right
'kay
so
um i guess we should pick the case then
if we go with the plasticky case or the the plastic case um
then the chip on print is still kind of we could have either or
we could have a complex one or a a non complex
yeah
but did we decide that the rubbery feel was important enough to us
well what about what you said like putting the
just just maybe yeah
finger grips just on top of the plastic
just a little bit of
okay
so we would we would have the l. c. d. screen
as long as the pla uh the rubber is nowhere near the controls yes
'kay
so i guess the case would be plastic with
perhaps that's not even enough rubber to qualify as being part of it
it's more of a su it's more of a supplement maybe
yeah
yeah
m more of a l lamination perhaps
yeah
so then for the scroll are we going for the ipod type
yeah i think so
yeah
i think
okay
which will require a more expensive chip on print right
yes
it does
'kay
so
i guess that is that is that about it
so we have a good idea of what we're gonna need to to do on this
right
um okay so we will have another meeting in thirty minutes
um
here's what's gonna be going on
um
um ryan you'll be working on the user interface design
um
manuel you'll be working on the look and feel design
right
corrine we'll want a product evaluation
and the two of you get to play with the uh modelling components and uh
maybe and and get us a prototype
which should go along well with your look and feel design and your interface
so that basically just be working on the prototype uh we'll accomplish your other two actions
alright
okay
let's do it
yep
soon as i
get this
okay
this is our last meeting
um i'll go ahead and go through the minutes from the previous meeting
uh and then we'll have a the prototype presentation
um then we will um do an evaluation
uh or we'll see what what we need to have under the criteria for the evaluation
then we'll go through the finance and see if we fall within the budget
um then we'll do the evaluation and then we can finish up after that with um any changes that we'll need to make
or hopefully everything will fall right in line
um let's see minutes from the last meeting
um we looked at uh the the trends
we had uh the fashion trends that people want a fancy look and feel
it was twice as important as anything else
um they liked fruit and vegetables in the new styles
um and a spongy feel
so we were talking about trying to incorporate those into our prototype
um they wanted limited buttons and simplicity
um then we looked at the uh the method for coming up with our own remote
um looking at other other devices
um the ipod we really liked the look of that
um we also had uh the kid's remote for a simple idea
um a two part remote which was what were were originally looking at
uh and then um there was talk of spee uh speech recognition um becoming more uh predominant and easier to use
but i think we've still decided not to go with that
then we looked at the components um
the materials for the case the different energy sources the different types of chips
um and made a decision on what we were going to use to make our remote
um and basically
how what were making for the prototype
so i'm going to leave it at that and let you guys take over
the prototype discussion
the prototype yeah
do you need a this
no
okay
can try to plug that in there but
there is our remo the banana
um yeah basically we we st went with the colour yellow
um working on the principle of a fruit which was mentioned it's basically designed around a banana
um but it would be held in such a fashion where it is obviously it wouldn't be that floppy 'cause this would be hard plastic
these would be like the rubber the rubber grips
so that's so that would hopefully help with grip or like the ergonomics of it
um but all the controlling would be done with this scroll wheel
you have to use your imagination a little bit
and this here represents the screen where you where you'd go through
very nice
and the the simplest functions would be um almost identical to an ipod where that one way ch through channels that way th other way through channels
volume up and down
and then to access the more complicated functions you'd you sorta go you press that and go through the menus
it's that that simple
that just represents the infrared uh beam
that's a simple on and off switch
um i don't know we could use the voice
t that blue bits should be yellow d that that'd be where the batteries would be i suppose
and um that's about it
it's as simple as you we could make it really
is there anything you want to add
right
that's what we have there
that's plastic
plastic covered with rubber
we might
uh add some more underneath here
maybe give it give it a form
i mean you're supposed to hold it like that but um just if you grab it
take it from somewhere so yeah you have some rub yeah
yeah
doesn't make much make much difference
mm-hmm
you could work left handed or right handed i suppose
exactly use both
might as well think about
t the actual thing might be smaller
th think about the button as well
yeah
like either put either one one on either side or
what but what's that button
not do it at all
just the on and off
it's a quick on off button
uh 'kay
that's um
yeah i think it's pretty important
so you don't have to fiddle with that
'kay
right
um that's not um i'd say a bit smaller would probably be nice
yeah
you wanna play with that over there
there you go
it's you know it's flimsy 'cause it's made out of heavy play doh but
would you like to uh
right
pretty impressive
well done
kind of a banana
and whether or not it would fall into the cost everything i suppose
with the scroll and the l. c. d.
well luckily we are going to find out
or not luckily
i do
um do you have a marketing presentation for us
okay
you guys are gonna help me do an evaluation of the criteria
um
okay
so first i'll just discuss some of the criteria that i found
just based on the past trend reports that i was looking at earlier
and then we'll do a group evaluation of the prototype
and then we will calculate the average score to see how we did
um so the criteria we're gonna be looking at are the complaints um that we heard from the users who were interviewed earlier
so
we're gonna be doing it based on a seven point scale
and one is going to mean true that we did actually achieve that
with seven being false we did not achieve that
okay
so for the first one we need to decide did we solved the problem of the users who complained about an ugly remote
i think it's definitely different than anything else out there
mm
yeah
so if they think that what is out there is ugly then yes i would say i would say most definitely
i would
it's bright
it's bright
it's
it still has your traditional black
it's curved
it's not there's no sharp
angles to it
yep not angular
mm
i'd say when it comes to the ergonomics the form and stuff yes that's definitely more beautiful than your average
however the colour we don't have a say in that
yeah i think the colours detract a little bit
some people might say it
that has been that has been dictated pretty much by the company
yeah
mm
so uh to answer that honestly i would rather say like uh
that's true
yep
we have not solved the problem completely with the ugly remote because the colour is ugly definitely
yeah
yeah
's nothing you can say about that
i mean i much prefer something like brushed chrome with that form
yeah
but
yeah something more modern to go a a modern colour to go with the modern form
right
right
it's different
you don't want your uh
three feet huge l. c. d. dis display in your living room that's hanging from the wall to be controlled with something like that
um okay so do you think since we
this was a a sign criteria do you think maybe we should put it somewhere in the middle then
does that sound good
yeah
yeah
yeah
what do you think
three
four
i would say
five
four
four is fair
yeah
okay
very non committal four
okay the second one
did we make it simple for new users
it's very intuitive i think yeah
yeah
i think that was the main aim one of the main aims that we had
s give it a one
one 'kay
yeah
okay
um do the controls now match the operating behaviour of the users
uh yeah
i'd say that
'cause we've we've brought it down to basically four controls most common which are channel and volume
right
mm-hmm
and then the other ones are just a matter of just going just scrolling further
s scrolling through and selecting a few
yeah
right
so one
so that's a one
yeah
i think that's a one
okay
okay um the fourth one
how about the problem of a remote being easily lost
one of the number one complaints
something that big and that yellow you just don't lose anymore
yeah
whether you want to or not you're not gonna lose it
it's bright yellow
bright yellow's hard to lose
but um if we were to if we were that the speech recognition
that we could maybe just use that solely for the the finding thing
that was what we'd we'd mentioned
so if we incorporate speech recognition into it then it could
just just to use to find it when it was lost
but like i said like i don't think you'd lose something so yellow so easily
oops
and it's not gonna fall like a rectangle would slip down behind things
hmm
that's gonna be a difficult shape to
well what
and it is quite bright and
yeah
maybe in the middle again three or four or something
s
okay
uh
i mean you know loo losing things is one of those things that people can lose i mean a million ways
yeah
you can pick it up and walk away with it and then you've lost it
that's true
mm
but if we do go with the with the speech recognition then it then our scale goes up quite a bit i think
mm
oh yeah
yeah
you probably
probably two
you know
if we eliminate the fact that you know it's impossible to guarantee that it's not gonna be lost then
yeah
mm
i'd say two
with the speech recognition which of course may
be changed depending on budget
yeah
y you could add an extra feature actually
which makes this thing
raise hell when you remove it too far from the television
yeah
we could add that but that's nothing we have thought of so far
which which may be cheaper than speech recognition if it were just a
yes
yeah true
but i mean d just those whistling clapping key rings you have
annoying alarm or something
yeah
it's it's
they're cheap
so it can't be that
um the it's based on this anti anti theft technology for suitcases and stuff where you have one piece that's attached to your luggage another piece that starts beeping
expensive
some sort of proximity
yeah
that can't cost much
yeah
so that can also easily be integrated because these things are small enough to to hide
so you have one piece you have to glue somewhere behind your stick it behind your t. v. and the other
stick it on the t. v.
pray that you don't accidentally lose that piece
right
that'd be tough then
well also your remote would uh alarm you if somebody stole you t your television yeah
ran off with it without taking the beautiful remote control
yeah
so
are we adding one of these
two features
let's add one of those features and say yes
gonna say okay
okay
so we're back to a one
or a two
two
two
two 'kay
two
okay
are we technologically innovative
uh
i'd say so
uh don't get many mo remote controls with
it's all just
screens on
it's all just stolen technology when it comes down to right right right right
yeah it's stolen technology
from ipod yeah
it's
but we have
but there's not a lot of yellow there's not a lotta yellow
but for remotes yeah
course that wasn't really we were kinda forced to take that colour
fa
two
three
'cause it's stolen
i don't know that we are that innovative to tell you the truth
no maybe not
yeah not really
but how many remotes do you see like this
not so many
if we added the screaming factor then we go up
right
um i would say we're probably at four
really
okay
that's gonna hurt us
okay
um spongy material
yeah well you have that kind of sort of
we have some spongy yeah
yeah as much as as needed i think
'kay
it's not a one though
no
one would be the whole thing
yeah
because it's only got what these parts are the grips and perhaps the back side the bottom the underneath on the back
to fold and stuff
yeah
yeah
so that's a four at most
probably a four at most
and lastly did we put the fashion in electronics
possibly even a five
y yes
i'd say we did
yeah
if your fashion is b is carmen miranda you betcha
more
yeah
well the recent fashion is rather displayed in the in the l. c. d. and the way you operate it than the form and the colour but it definitely is
on the
it's true
yeah
be what we were told and they'd say yeah definitely
'kay
alright
now we just gotta calculate
six eight twelve sixteen
seventeen divided by s
seven is
eight
two point
two point four
is that some long division
no
well i haven't done math in years
something
what two i dunno
just i'm sure there's a
okay we'll say two point four two
right
how does that look
i'm impressed
i can't do that without a calculator
it's been a while
no i can't do long very impressive
and what what is the acceptable criteria
is there like a scale that we have to hit
oh no
they just told me to
pick my own criteria and have you guys evaluate it basically
alright then
so that's that
okay
well let's see
now we get to do the budget numbers
you didn't know that you were gonna have a budget
but we do
okay
yeah
yeah so
you'd been going a long time dividing that
it's two point four two eight five se it just keeps going on
oh my god
okay
two point four two basically
yeah we'll go with that
fifty percent you're kidding
not too shabby
so i have here an
yeah
p
we want a fifty percent profit on this
oh you can't really see that very well
charge about three hundred quid for it
twelve and a half euros is what supposed to cost us
okay so
it's too much
well let's see
um
the f the
wonder if i can make this
uh
what the
oh it won't let me do that
okay
alright so at top i don't know if you guys can read that or not
i can't 'cause i don't have my glasses on but so we've got the energy source
there's uh four five six categories
battery
we have energy source electronics case
then we have case material supplements interface type and then button supplements
okay so
uh first of all energy source we picked battery
um and how many batteries do we think this will probably take
probably
some e either two or four
two
two
like it
at four it's gonna be too heavy so that that's not our problem
people can change it every month
excellent
they won't know until after they bought it
this is consumerism
alright so for the electronics our choices are simpl simple chip on print regular chip on print advanced chip on print sample sensor sample speaker
we're advanced chip are we
that's the advanced chip on print yeah
'kay we have one of those
'kay then the case is a
probably it's double curved
double curved yes
case materials are plastic
plastic
um i guess it's two since one for the top one for the bottom
n no
is that right or is it just one
no that's just one
maybe it's one because of the
it's just one mo single mould we can do that
'kay
yeah yeah
right
i guess it doesn't matter 'cause the price on that one is zero which is nice
exactly right
oh
special colour
that's not a special colour
bright yellow
it's a specially ugly colour but it's not special
interface type
we have pushbutton scroll wheel interface integrated scroll wheel pushbutton and an l. c. d. display
s
s
that's
yeah
so we actually have the l. c. d. display
and then
and then is it the integrated or is it
i'd say the integrated
yes unfortunately
yeah
'kay
button supplement
special colour
mm
um special form
special material
we could of course make the buttons wood
say mahogany or so
it'd look really lovely
or titanium
mm-hmm or titanium
yeah
they cost us all the same
remote control
uh just
well we only have one button so really we shouldn't be charged we shouldn't be charged anything for the the button supplements
no that's getting a bit
tiny
um
yeah
i'd ignore that
leave it blank
okay
we're gonna leave that one blank because we run on a l. c. d. and scroll
so our total is fifteen point five
which i believe is
yeah that's too much
by three euros over
it's hard to believe
so we'll go for the hand dynamo huh
so the only thing better than um a banana shaped remote is one that you shake
if it w
what if we completely took out the the one single button we've got on
and just had a scroll wheel interface
and the l. c. d. display
i suppose the l. c. d. c. display's the one that's pushing it up a bit though
yeah 'cause the
well 'cause we have to have both right
yeah
i mean let's let's face it it also depends on the software on the on the television
yeah
you can have the the information that this thing transmits be being displayed on the on the screen
mm-hmm
so s yeah let's take away the
yeah you could maybe take out the l. c. d. dis display even if it if it comes up on the computer itsel on the t. v. itself
yeah
yeah
right
so we may not need the l. c. d. display
uh that is possible yeah
right
we may not need it
there you go
well there we go
perfect
there we go
perfect
twelve point five
okay
so we just remove our
screen
screen here
make it a bigger dial
easier to use
even easier to use then
okay the
besides look at what the l. c. d. does to our lovely remote
back to the design room boys
so we can just
take away a heck of a lot of the there you go
central
what's the blue part
that was just we ran out of yellow
oh that's the batteries
oh that's just yeah
okay
there you go
there you go
oops
even simpler
looks more like a banana
yeah
for all those fruit lovers out there
there you go
one more criteria
okay so the costs under twelve point five euro
was no
we redesigned it
yeah
now it's yes
next slide
project evaluation
uh project process satisfaction with for example room for creativity leadership teamwork means new ideas found
um
so
i guess that
let's see here
i think that perhaps the project evaluation's just supposed to be completed by me
but
i'd like to hear your thoughts
fair enough
trying to fill in some time there
uh h what did you think of our project process
i think we did yeah i think we did quite well
great
yeah
um
good
good teamwork
just half a day you have a remote
yeah
there you go
right from the start of the day
yeah i think
we sort of knew where we were going straight away i thought
we st we started off a little little weak
our leadership was quite weak in the beginning
um um
but as the day went along we had more idea of what we were doing
um room for creativity
there was that
um i
think we tried a lotta different things and um
i think it was um interesting as you guys brought up more um information and studies that we were right on with a lot of those things
um you guys worked together well as a team
and um the means
which was the whiteboard and the pens
yeah
we've used the whiteboard
super super
i had some problem with the pen i think but minus your p
minus your powerpoint fiasco
well that's not my fault
that's obviously the people i work for uh that work for me uh they've just you know
no i know
i'm yeah
well
incom
heads are gonna roll believe me
have a we have a list of employees that you would like fired
yes yes
okay
n new ideas found
um
mm
kinda
yes for the remote
maybe no not f for
technology used
technology
alright
closing
costs are within the budget
project is evaluated
um complete the final questionnaire and meeting summary
that's it
excellent
and i still have to do my minutes for the last meeting
actually
um so there will probably be another
questionnaire coming up
we might have a while though
and then we'll have to check with the main boss whether we can what goes on after that
but that's the end of our meeting
uh i guess i start with my presentation
we had two groups of people working on this
so we'll show you two slightly different presentations
feel free to ask any questions or comments obviously
okay
um the first one was done by myself bruno marianne and nikos
and the rationale that we have i'll show you the layout in a second was that full professors would get private offices
administration is close to the professors offices so it's easier for the secretary to speak to everyone
mm-hmm
the fax is in the administration office since it's mostly used by gisella who's the secretary
for noise reduction purposes we've moved everyone who has office hours together and we've also put the network printer and the photocopier in the hall
um so i'll just show you how that works
basically you can see gisella sort of there in the middle with the fax machine and maggie and susan
who are the two full professors in our department have the private offices
and the photocopier and the printer are sort of in the hall on the side there across from mailboxes
um just to go back most people are grouped in projects
and we have two fifty per cent people who are half time in geneva half time at the e. p. f. l. in lausanne
and they m them we've put in three person offices so that in the three person offices it's not constantly three people
so there's a little bit of give there
and the reading room or the lounge as some people call it that we have is in a central position
mm-hmm
so basically we've got andre and nancy at the top
um they don't actu they will be starting a new project together if um if i'm not mistaken
like i said susan and maggie in the individual offices
mm-hmm
nikos and yalina who work on the same project at the bottom
the reading room is in the middle
um marianne and bruno are at the bottom
um as well marianne works closely with pierrette and the other marianne
we have two mariannes in our department
and david is a half time
so as i said the half times are in the three person offices
and on the other side we have maria martin and myself who all work on the same project
and martin is fifty per cent
um gisella we've given her two person office for two reasons one is because there's a spare place there
so if we want to put a stagieur or someone who just comes in for short period of time
we figured it was okay if they were in the admin office which is a little bit noisy because they're only there for a short period of time
um and again the proximity to the other offices
um so i guess that's pretty much it for our proposal
mm-hmm
um i don't know if you want andre to go through his first or if you have any questions for me
so you sa so pierrette is a professor but she's only she's only fifty per cent time
yes
yeah martin
is that why she's in a three person office
she's it's do you wanna explain how it it works or
uh actually martin is fifty per cent time
mar
martin is fifty per cent
uh-huh
yeah
pierrette there's two sort of statutes of professor
no
i guess you could say where there's
oh because you would say that she's an assistant professor or something like that
yeah
ah
i see
oh okay
yeah
but um yeah maybe that's
there's a professeur d'ecole and the
yeah there are full professors and assistant professors if you want
yeah ho
and yeah it's true that she's an assistant professor but uh well
we see maybe we can move a little bit around just to give her uh
mm
well also at least maybe not a uh an office alone but at least with just one person not two
mm
mm-hmm
but the idea is maggie and susan are sort of the senior
we'll see
yeah
mm-hmm
um professors on staff so they got the the individual offices
mm-hmm
and what what's happening what what do you foresee happening in the next couple of years
like beyond this m b beyond this current group of people do we do we know of any changes coming
is the department growing
or is it is it going to be
um the department will obviously be growing but there are some people who only work part time
there's some people who are doing p. h. d. s or master students who won't necessarily be there for a larger extent of time
mm-hmm
so for example yalina and the finnish marianne are master students for right now
so whether they decide to stay and do a p. h. d. we're not sure yet
mm-hmm
um nikos is working um as a researcher
so for him it's the same thing
there's i think the only constant people are susan maggie andre
um gisella pierrette um and all the rest are either p. h. d. students or master students
and again martin and david are half time with the e. p. f. l. so
that's project dependent as well
mm-hmm
mm-hmm
unfortunately we haven't been given as much space as we would have liked but that's always the case
mm-hmm
that's always the case
yeah
mm
and have you have you talked to th any of these people to ask them if they have any
special requirements
um susan wanted a private office she has a preference for private offices
oh
mm-hmm
mm-hmm
other than that no one really had any tight constraints from what i've heard
of people they needed to be near or people they would needed to avoid or anything like that
no one's explicitly said that they needed to avoid anyone else
okay
okay
alright
um
but you've given people chance to say that if they really needed to
yeah yeah yeah
yeah
okay good
but you no specific uh views for mountains or old town or i mean people prefer any windows
no they were fine with it so
oh
oh
and they're both nice views
mm-hmm
yeah i guess those thin lines or i mean they're windows or okay
yeah they're windows yeah
or sorry the thick lines are windows actually
we have fairly big windows in the room yeah
oh oh k okay oh 'kay
mm-hmm
mm-hmm
so there's lots of light coming in
mm-hmm
and one of the reasons for putting the reading room where it was is that you have a lot of light coming in
so if people just go somewhere to sort of relax and
hmm
have a quiet place to sips sit they have a lot of light and
it says mountains
is that because that's the view
hmm
yeah yeah
yeah
yeah yeah
so it's the best view
you gave the reading room the best view
yeah
yeah well i mean it depends if you like looking out over the old town and the cathedral
mm-hmm
yeah
yeah yeah
okay
that sort of goes both ways but yeah we've got two mountain views
oh two mountain views
sort of on that side that side and then the last part looks on the old town
yeah
oh and that's old town
and then one of old town
okay
because we're on the sixth floor you can actually see everything 'cause i don't think buildings are much higher than was it six or eight floors
okay
yeah
mm-hmm
yeah no mountains are just in the far so that's not
no okay
yeah
what's that purple thing there
the purple thing is the mailboxes
oh okay
and those are fixed we can't do anything about those
mm-hmm
oh
so
so you can't do any partitions
i mean you plan to do any partitions in three p person rooms or like this kind of blocks
um r
we don't have anything like that
if we can get stuff like that it might be a good idea
some people might like them
at the moment we have people thre sharing like three people in a room without any partitions and
yeah
yeah
yeah just three desks yeah
it's a little bit noisy but people sort of get used to it and admittedly it's mostly assistants that are stuck in rooms like that
yeah
yeah
yeah
so it's junior people but
mm-hmm
yeah
um well uh i can think of some reactions from the people wi so maybe i can well r
alright
well do you want to do your presentation and
yeah well tell me about some of the constraints and well first of all i must say that there are also quite a lot of common points
so um it's probably not going to be very difficult to yeah please
okay
okay
so
thanks
perfect
so um yeah actually we um well basically the the group who produced this uh proposal is made by susan
martin david and uh and myself
and we also well susan volunteered to ask maggie and pierrette about how they they felt about sharing offices and
so as you can see well um susan gets obviously the same office which is quite a good thing
um then things started move a bit
it looks like i'm also in the same position
but the most obvious constraints that uh we we found here was that it was probably very difficult to have a lounge uh just a lounge in one room
because it would block us two full working places
and although it's true that the group i agree decided to to had to have a lounge
we propose to put the lounge uh in the room at the the upper side on on the right
uh so let two people share this with uh sort of a yeah a place where we have a sofa maybe and uh and some books
so it's obviously a calm place
people are not there to talk very loud but they can sit and relax and uh still look at at the mountains
um also so that's one of the main differences i think maybe one of the points that we have to talk about
mm-hmm
uh the other one is the admin office
so it's gisella fifty per cent because she's only half time and uh the fax machine
um gisella actually has a lot of phone calls to make and uh it's true that her activity is quite noisy when she's there
um it's also true that she has quite a lot of files for most of the the projects actually that we manage
so it appeared at least to well to our group
that even if she's here only half time
she should have an office by her own because it would be quite disturbing for other people to to work in the the same office
uh gisella has has no objection against sharing the office
we thought it was more for the the calm of the the people
it's true that this blocks one of the one person rooms but uh on the other hand
uh maggie has no objection uh sharing an office with her assistant
and this appeared to be true also of pierrette
we don't know about pierrette sharing an office with two persons but at least no problem in pierrette sharing her office with uh marianne
the the swedish one who is sort of her assistant
um so this is why we yeah we put maggie with with bruno
and then the third main difference uh would be the the number of visitor places or free places
uh you notice a new name in the room uh at the centre upper upper side
so that's paola
it's true that it's someone coming next year susan reminded me this uh of this point and i could not really ignore it
mm-hmm
uh so um that she's an italic she will arrive in about two month
and the two uh vis one and vis two are the visitor places
you had one i think called free space or spare spare place
yeah
um we didn't really reach a very good agreement on the distribution of these two rooms
so the the two at the centre uh where is written paola yalina the two visitors and then maria plus david
so i think there is quite a lot of space here to uh switch a little bit among the people just to make some kind of smooth occupancy rate
so not to have one empty room when we have no visitors um and uh then a very full room when everybody is is here
so i think we're we are quite willing to split and put say maybe one visitor with maria and david uh fifty per cent in the other room with the second visitor
mm-hmm
so that it smooth is
but realistically we don't actually have that many visitors coming in
i've been here for almost two years and we've had a couple of stagieurs but that's it
well yeah
exactly so the visitors are uh basically stagieur and it happens that sometimes we have two of them even if it's only for three or four month
martin seemed to insist that when we have a visiting professor for instance
we cannot really put him with gisella because well they wouldn't feel very nice they they made a joke about that
no for a professor yeah but
mm
so we should manage some kind of decent space
it's true that these one or two last one or two years we didn't have uh a visiting professor
but um
yeah so uh i think yeah these are the three main points
so one is the place of the lounge
uh the other one is the uh the place of the admin office with gisella
and the third one is the number of visitor visiting people and uh well how many of them we want to accommodate and where where we put it
these i think are the three main differences
otherwise we pretty much agree on uh on placing people
oh in a way if that's your argumentation then put a visiting person with a senior
hmm
researcher at least if not a professor rather than two students
mm-hmm
mm-hmm
um sorry
i i didn't understand
if you're gonna argue that the visitors are supposed to be important and they should have their own space
mm-hmm
then put them with another researcher rather than two students
mm-hmm
yeah that's that's true i think yeah they are are quite open to to this
martin also reminded us that he is quite noisy
he has a lot of uh phone calls to make even if it's here if he's here only fifty per cent of the time
um so yeah i i i don't mind this
but uh that's something but it's true yeah we could also try to put a visitor and the professor
hmm
um martin made another point
it was the fact that sometimes professor have to professors have to discuss sensitive matters about projects and financing
and they sometimes might feel uncomfortable discussing this with their well in the presence of their p. h. d. students
mm-hmm
like saying oh i i have to reduce her t from eighty per cent to fifty per cent
that's probably something so i i mean all these are constraints
uh uh
i don't know how how you would like us to proceed from from here or if you already have questions or reactions on this one
mm
but how often the lounge is used um
people uses on regular basis daily basis or
fairly regularly there's at least one or two people in there
oh
yeah
in the lounge yeah
i mean it's a yeah
it's a fairly new thing in the department but it's being used pretty regularly or something that a lot of people wanted
okay
just sort of quiet space out of your office that doesn't have the office furniture
hmm
the office chairs it sort of has comfortable sofas and armchairs and things like that where you can just go and relax
mm-hmm
and or if you wanna read something for a longer period of time in a more comfortable environment
hmm
and because we do a lot of reading and things like that it does get used fairly often
so it's not a place for discussion
and it's it's it's a quiet place
we sort of have an open policy where if there's no one in there and you want to have a discussion then that's fine
yeah
mm-hmm
but you can't displace people who are in there reading just because you want to have a mini meeting or whatever
mm i see
okay
mm-hmm
and so i there's no are you planning some kind of partition between the lounge and the offices or ar how are you gonna keep those things i think should ask the question to you
yes
mm-hmm
yeah um
how are you gonna keep them separate
yeah
'cause it seems like
well mm-hmm
fairly separate functions
yeah we yeah that's true that's one of the problems
um well we were told that it was not really possible to build walls but we noticed that this room actually has two doors
yeah
so uh we thought that maybe we could put some kind of well separation
yeah
book cases or something or yeah
i yeah maybe just yeah furniture or just uh some kind of screen
mm yeah
yeah
hmm
but it won't be uh an acoustic separation
no it's not sound proof
so if if the those are students there
yeah they're
so if they're noisy that could disrupt the quiet of the lounge
yeah
um
which is sort of why in our proposal we had it completely as a separate room
but
mm-hmm
as a separate room
mm-hmm
mm-hmm
so if you really want peace and quiet you shut the door and when the doors are shut
mm
mm-hmm
like unless someone's making noise right outside the door it really is fairly quiet
yeah
mm-hmm
mm-hmm
yeah
but you've also put the lounge in a a very k kind of a high traffic area where the mailboxes are the printer and the restrooms
mm-hmm
so that's um
that may also tha that may be good for
meeting people and bumping into people but it's maybe against the idea if it's a very supposed to be an isolated quiet spot
mm-hmm
mm-hmm
mm-hmm
so i d mm you know
yeah well it was actually this pressure from from my group that led to this to squeeze a little bit uh the place of the lounge
mm-hmm
now how for instance would the university feel about a room that would be only used as a lounge
mm-hmm
would they feel it's too empty and that we have too much space
or w is there no problem
hmm
the do do you see a problem with having a l a room just for a lounge or no
mm
well maybe if it if it helps us pack more people into the offices because they have a private lounge
yeah
maybe it's a good thing
saves us money
hmm
but uh
yeah
so we could have a separate room as a lounge as long as uh we pack the other offices
uh yeah i guess that's let's see what is that
mm
personally i i have no problem with this
mm
so um that's that's fine
mm
i mean suppose if the need really arises and it comes to a point where we do have a lot of people
then you can get rid of the lounge
figure out what to do with the furniture either distribute it between various offices or put it into storage somewhere
mm-hmm
mm-hmm
mm yeah
but you're saying it does get used
so you've it's it's not a completely experimental concept
yeah
your your department has a lounge and it gets used a lot
no no no
no this is something that it started off sort of as a discussion at the coffee table
yeah
mm-hmm
where people were complaining that sort of in the middle of the afternoon they just wanted somewhere to go off and
oh
mm-hmm
mm-hmm
yeah
so you have some oh
no have some quiet time and that's where it came from
so you have some books also like
mm-hmm
there are bookshelves in there but it's not really a library 'cause everyone at the moment
oh okay
hmm
everyone has a bookshelf in their office and we just go in and borrow books from everyone else
oh
it's more really about having a comfortable place to sit um where it's not an office environment it doesn't look anything like an office
yeah
yeah you mean you can display some new journals or a new proceedings and yeah
mm-hmm
so it's just
yeah yeah and people can come w in with their stuff or leave a newspaper or a magazine lying around for other people
yeah yeah exactly
yeah yeah
yeah
mm-hmm
yeah
yeah
we've got a bulletin board where you can paste up articles that you think are b interesting for other people but
mm-hmm
yeah
mm-hmm
yeah
okay so i think maybe we can agree on on the lounge in a separate room if we can manage to to find space elsewhere
what about gisella how do you feel about putting her in a separate office
which is the case now i think
i d
well she has an extra yeah
well she shares an office so which is why we were thinking that it wouldn't be a problem to s keep her with a spare person
with a visitor space yeah
mm-hmm
mm-hmm
because that's the w the situation it is right now
and if you're a stagieur and you're coming and you don't necessarily expect to have a full blown office if you are only there for about two months
mm-hmm
mm-hmm
yeah it depends on what kind of visitor you are exactly
yeah
so we could say some kind of low key visitor
this is uh very nice
mm-hmm
mm-hmm
you mean these fifty per cents i mean they're all separate or
actually gisella fifty per cent means that she's there half time uh generally in the mornings
yeah
okay
gisella has a fixed schedule for when she's there but david and martin are sort of they f it fluctuates
yeah
yeah okay
yeah
like they can't say that they'll be there monday tuesday and half of wednesday and not the rest of the time which is part of the problem
i mean they don't okay
yeah yeah
yeah okay
mm-hmm
i mean they can't s specify when exactly they'll be there
mm-hmm
so our rationale for putting them in a three person room is is that it doesn't matter when they're there and whether they're there for certain hours or not
it's just either there's two or three people in those rooms and sometimes there's less sometimes there's more because we also don't work fixed hours
mm-hmm
yeah
mm-hmm
it's not like we work you know nine to five or whatever
everyone sort of keeps their own hours
mm-hmm
so can you just summarize briefly the differences between your two proposals the key differences
um i think it's what i tried to to do before it's the shared lounge uh th
uh sh shared
yeah
yeah the shared lounge the the assistants with their professors
um
in two cases
yeah
yeah
and then secretary has separate room
do you have assistants with professors
we have pierrette and marianne in the same
yeah
no i think this is quite accepted and it's a bit the case
oh okay
so that's okay
yeah okay 'cause
yeah
no i think it's uh the lounge uh the admin room
so yeah
yeah okay
t. v. at the lounge the admin room separate
an
yeah and the number of slots for visitors and for this new student who arrives
not shared
yeah
for visitors
mm
because having just one spare place this was probably the strongest disagreement in my group
mm-hmm
people said uh we should have at least two or three spare places just for you know growing or sometimes you have three interns that arrive
mm
mm-hmm
so even if they are not perfect places
um
okay so you basically achieve that by giving less space to the reading room i think
mm-hmm
yeah that's yeah that's how we did in in our proposal yeah
yeah
yeah
yeah
right
yeah
uh
so i guess what one of the questions is how important is the reading room to your group really
is it is it something that's a very valued thing that has to be protected um
yeah
mm-hmm
or is it okay to l make it be kind of this spare space that gets used up a little bit when you need when you have some extra visitors or things like that
yeah
yeah
yeah
i think that's
mm-hmm
i think because it's a fairly new thing it's a little hard to say at this point
yeah
mm-hmm
i think that most people like it now that it's there
they sort of see the value of it and they wouldn't want to see it wiped out entirely definitely
mm yeah
mm-hmm
mm-hmm
but i suppose once it if it gets eaten away a little bit at one some point it becomes unuseful and then yeah
yeah
yeah
yeah
mm-hmm
so it
and that's the danger is
yeah mm-hmm
mm yeah
but then we need to squeeze in in one of the three person rooms some extra visitor space and uh i i think so
n d
yeah
if if we want to keep the reading room
uh i think it's possible by playing a little bit with the furniture
hmm
mm-hmm
um so yeah
i think another point here and i don't know how you you feel about it is well
the fact that martin is said he would be quite noisy fifty per cent of the time
so many phone calls
so i wouldn't put him in that big office even if he's fifty per cent but he's still a professor here and we got him from e. p. f. l.
yeah
mm-hmm
mm 'kay
mm-hmm
so that i i think i mean if we need to reach a solution now i i wouldn't mind working from your plan and doing some changes
or if you prefer working from mine and doing other changes
sure
either way
so um
okay well since this one's up keep this one in
okay yeah
depends how how easy you can write in it
easily go ahead
okay so let's keep the reading room
mm-hmm
uh also i think pierrette pierrette and martin p should deserve at least i think offices with one person not with two
yeah
double rooms
mm 'kay
uh
maybe can you combine both or like in two person room pierrette too
pierrette and martin
yeah martin is fifty per cent
yeah
we we never asked them it could be but um on the other side they have
maybe
i think no real project in common so i wonder
okay
whe i i think i would prefer and probably my group would prefer
to see them with the respective assistants and i think pierrette plus marianne is a very good combination
mm-hmm
why not switching them from yeah that office
here
yeah switch the whole group
yeah marianne swedish and then pierrette
out
so what does that mean swedish um
there's two mariannes one is swedish one is finnish
because there are two mariannes
yeah
one is finishing
oh i see
so we just call them the swedish and the finnish
okay
okay
and both family names start with s. t. a.
oops
oh
oh
no
okay
no both start with s. but
no not true
the just s.
just s. uh so just to know who they are okay
yes
uh it was bruno right
yeah
mm 'kay
mm-hmm
now let's do something with martin too
um
but then you can create on more spared place in that big three piece room no
in here
yeah somewhere
yeah maybe we can write it down say vis vis one
fifty per cent
okay
david is fifty per cent and visitor one should yeah or spare or it's fine
mm-hmm
well for m martin if you didn't mind working with martin we can switch nancy and martin here
gisella
yeah mm-hmm
i think that's closer to what i said
oops
well because actually we have this project in common
you know call i. m. two
yeah
ah
wrong keyboard
i've heard of that
um yeah i think it's and so d could we um
so we can say that this is sort of for but then again you get the more formal visitor in with a bunch of students in a crowded room
mm-hmm
well i think yeah always gisella but i think there is no way to uh
well you can say that this one is for let's say stagieurs or interns
mm-hmm
yeah sort of second uh
um
yeah yeah yeah
um yeah
but then you can move administration to the single room
the k because she's only fifty per cent working and
yeah
and she will
so you would put gisella in a one person room
oh yeah
yeah and give that room to f some professor with a student or from for visitor with the visiting place or
yeah
yeah
mm-hmm
yeah we could yeah even put
well you can move maggie and bruno
we couldn't put maggie and bruno together
into this room
that's obviously the case
move gisella move the other spare place to the big room but then there's not a lot of people in there
mm-hmm
no let's leave it like this for the moment
how do you feel because your office well three persons and you are all full time in there so you with nancy and maria
we're not terribly noisy i think it'll be fine
uh-huh
yeah and you have parmenides in common with nancy
yeah
and i am too in common with maria
mm-hmm
and we work on slightly different schedules too 'cause maria and i tend to work earlier and nancy tends to work later
mm-hmm
so that shouldn't be a problem
mm-hmm
and do you think we could put a visitor with nikos and yalina
because it's it's also it's not very clear you know yalina's that we said in our meeting
yalina's master thesis should be defended in a couple of months or something like that
mm-hmm
so we don't really know what happens afterwards
so we could at least think it's sort of an open place
yeah
mm-hmm
or we could get that office for you and nancy and put nikos and uh yalina with maria and a visitor
yeah
what about that
wouldn't you like to have a calmer spot
yeah
sure
um so you want to do
mm
that's gonna back fire on me
so when you when you put four people in that office does that mean you're planning on four desks
you need space for four desks
yeah
yeah
and that's the problem is that you either get smaller desks 'cause the ones that we have now won't fit
do you know if it's possible
yeah
yeah
yeah but a visitor actually uh doesn't have that much paper so for instance maybe they don't need uh
yeah
well uh the place to put their files you know a smaller drawer
mm right
they just need a a desk and probably just one drawer under underneath
yeah
mm-hmm
and so you can fit that you think
but you can't put three desks in the two person rooms
no
yeah probably not
i think it wouldn't be uh yalina and maybe we could think of a visitor too here
mm-hmm
yeah
so that
i think it's gonna be too much
think so
well maria is full time
because remember there is also this paola arriving um on the new project
so you know susan insisted that uh
we should be
and it it's al also it's not very clear because nikos and yalina are well
nikos is um research student yalina will finish her master thesis so it's
yeah okay
yeah paola or mm-hmm
so just like that
or maybe paola will be able to choose
mm
yeah i think that's quite okay
i don't know about any preference of maggie being alone or with bruno or no
no
okay
i don't think she cares
yeah
mm
um david mentioned also that there should be some kind of gender balance
yeah
uh i don't know if there is a strong constraint but i think we are doing pretty well
you mean maybe you should break the wall between the men's room and the women's room
well so
i'm not sure that was what was meant but
sorry
no
actu bruno did mention that he didn't want to be in a room with a lot of people 'cause he did that before and he didn't really like it
so maybe
oh mm
ha
i don't know i can switch with him and we can put him and nancy together
i don't mind it doesn't really bother me
okay that's fine if he mentioned this to you that's quite nice
okay
yeah
mm-hmm
and okay yeah i'm with martin
not very balanced
well the gender balancing we have more women than men in our department anyways so
mm-hmm
yeah that's why okay if you don't mind me sharing the office with martin that's fine
no
okay yeah that looks good
so agnes with marianne and david
okay
yeah so you have i. m. two in common
that's nice and he is fifty per cent so that means the office is not very crowded
okay the other one is a bit crowded but that's okay
do you see any constraints from any administrative sides
gisel
mm
mm
but even like you can put mm paola in administrate office like
mm
you're already three people
mm it looks like small room compared to the other three p
mm-hmm
is your person to square meter ratio within the n university norms
hmm
um i i think for the moment
good question
overall
we don't we don't i mean
we don't want people coming in seeing this lavish reading room and and and everyone having their own office if that's not what we are having in the other places
yeah
yeah
k
yeah
mm-hmm
we have to make sure that um if for example there's a spare reading room like we were saying before
yeah
overall your department has doesn't have excessive space per person
mm-hmm
mm-hmm
well what was said in in my group actually susan who knows professors from other um other faculties
well she noticed that most of them have rooms alone
mm-hmm
so this is true for susan and maggie but not true here for pierrette and and and martin
so we can already argue that uh we're squeezing in even the the professors
it's true that the reading room but you know we fought so much to have it so let's uh let's try to have it there
and i think putting four people in a three person room is already a sign that uh we are already quite uh quite full
mm right
so um i think yeah it's normally the nominal capacity of this i think it's uh eighteen people
yeah
um eighteen or or seventeen
mm-hmm
and we're only fifteen if you don't count paola and some visitor's place
mm-hmm
mm-hmm
and i think it's quite important to have space for visitors because if you have no visitors or if you cannot take a new
mm-hmm
well intern during the summer you're very much handicapped
mm-hmm
so i think we're yeah on well the reaction of my group was that this was almost full already so i well we tried to
mm-hmm
yeah
so basically we're moving into a new space but it's
i thin
mm-hmm
only marginally better than the old one
mm yeah
mm-hmm
yeah so i think yeah
mm bu
what we could say about the reading room is that we we squeeze quite a lot of people in in the other offices so i think it's okay
mm-hmm
alright
well
um
it's good in case i ever have to defend it
you know it's good to have some numbers if you can come up with some numbers uh
mm sure yeah we can do that
some
and maybe uh relative to some other comparable departments
that's it's it's good to have that
mm-hmm
mm 'kay
yeah
but if you both agree with this plan and you think your group will be happy then uh fine with me
sure
yeah
i don't know about you what do you think
yeah it's fine
yeah
okay
so i'll save that
perfect just save it please
yeah
maybe it's another name
just say okay it's fine
okay
okay
so my group also asked to circulate the final proposal just to make sure there is no major problem
the final copy
i'll circulate it to everyone along with the numbers that you guys wanted to see in terms of the space
mm-hmm
yeah
yeah
okay
and the numbers
okay
yep
and we're done
great thank you for your time
alright
well thank you
thank you
no problem
thank you sirs
thank you
okay
oh yeah
you don't put your headset microphone
so we are here to just make the point
well make the point yeah
make the status about the shot detection
okay
to so you have applied the shot detector to some of the cinetis video or at least one and uh so we can basically maybe just comment on on this
yeah
maybe quickly remind what the shot detector is how the shot detector is working basically
hmm
uh we might be able anyway to give you some reference
i mean your report it's it should be described there or yeah yeah
yeah
yeah i have actually yeah the we can see the report here and the demo
you have the report
okay
and the goal of uh this meeting is to present the video shot detector to olivier okay
to olivier yeah
yes
okay
so yeah it was my project um during my internship at idiap under the supervision of jean marc
and as you saw as you saw in the email i sent uh okay
i didn't send this video is the new one
i just um uh processed from your images
ah okay yes the kayak wi i was not even with the other one okay
yeah
but uh let's let's start by the video from friday
cinetis demo one
by the way i was uh going to ask so i had seen the video i you uh did um a downsampling of the video right
i mean
for uh browsing i mean
yeah
okay yeah
so this was uh
okay
so this is hierarchical normally so you have scenes and shots but
yeah here on the left you have different things but uh as applied
mm 'kay
because for instance we could probably you know
okay this is
like group all the initial ones into one scene and maybe after when there's some things inside it s should be another scene so
okay
so this detector uh detected the thirty shots
and if you click on uh plus button you can expand it and see the key frames that are in fact uh five extracted frames from the shot
mm-hmm
okay
which are extracted i think uh
but i think th uh as it is it's t extracted uh without uh using sub shots uh it's simply uh five down sam yeah down sampling
downsampling
okay
um so i we can see the video actually uh the entire video can open with real player
yeah
i hope it will work
so we don't have the the sound and it won't be grabbed the video won't uh i don't know if uh
okay it's not good quality
yeah the quality is that's why i was asking that
oh yeah yeah yeah
it it's not this that you processed right
no no no no no no
okay okay
it's in real media so it's very compressed
so here we see that we the shot at eighteenth and after twenty twos and after again
okay
and uh if we go down i mean maybe in terms of shot here we can see that
'kay
right i mean so now we see shot seven i suppose yeah
okay
uh yeah okay shot nine currently shot ten probably
uh okay
eleven or twelve
no eleven
uh ten yeah
or no this is ten indeed okay
and then there's um
yeah
yeah this one it's eleven twelve
mm-hmm
okay
or fourteen seconds
okay
yeah okay
okay
yeah it's inside and yeah
yes
and this one yeah it's a dissolve it's a dissolve so it doesn't detect yeah
it's really a dissolve or is it really like is you have the feeling that it's both
okay
when i saw the m. with m. player it's a dissolve yeah
okay
but it's it's it's not standard man made movies because i would say most of the time people couldn didn't do any dissolve
hmm
mm
yeah i could see here i mean that it was like horse it was only one single one
yeah
okay
yeah
i don't know if this one if we see was correctly uh you see
n yeah yeah
yeah
this is the one i i had seen yeah
yeah
but as i said i mean uh with even the motion detector when it's black it's there is not s no structure
so you don't esti yeah but you don't really estimate motion
but there is a moon
but okay because there is no motion in fact between the two shots
well there is no structure
there is no texture if you want to say so and this is this is not so good for the motion
yeah okay okay
uh but for instance of course between the horse and uh and um the c the c uh uh yeah
uh the cows yeah maybe we could have detected things
the cow
yeah
but it's not even sure because the background is quite similar and uh it's it's it's not that sure
mm-hmm
yeah maybe to explain this method was using uh a simple uh uh distance between uh consecutive histograms
okay
and we didn't use motion features at all for that that's why i we
mm
so it's yeah
the histogram so we have experience with it
yeah
yeah
yeah okay
so it's it's scrambled so you can scramble the image and you get the same histogram
okay
yeah
so there is no structure indeed so of course when you look the horse and then you can see as a cow the cows
okay
of course you have a black in the top and uh you have also uh maybe eighty percent of like green uh
which is even not green there but uh uh grass
mm-hmm
you have stones and uh so there of course are differences because on the one hand you have horse but it's black
so you have more sky which is black on the right so you don't care about this
okay
so it's a glo it's global it's a global histogram so yeah
'kay
but it's when for this i would for this application i could imagine that it would were quite high
hmm
enough
uh and it's a threshold but still it's adaptive right if i remember well yeah
yeah
yeah
with a sliding window
yeah
okay
so
because of course if you just compute the yeah
i can show you uh
if you have the report because if you compute the um distance between the two histograms i think this was bhattacharya
yeah
right
so now we know
hmm
okay
and uh so if you take uh these two with the with the bhattacharya uh then of course you should just do a threshold
when there is motion you will see a lot of things changing so by using an l. r. t. t. threshold
okay
if you see that there is a continuous change of the d distance you don't do a threshold
it's only if you have an identified peak which is m fifty percent or maybe uh two times higher than the the next second value in the window
okay
then you say it's it's a shot
yeah
right i don't know
i don't know if we c we want to make uh use the whiteboard or here it's uh it was uh to dis it's infra only the this part about uh shot boundary detection is in french unfortunately
yeah yeah
but uh the this image shows the results using motion when you s use the motion features and here on the right is when using the histogram uh distance
yeah
and the the motion features can better show what's going on when there is such a difficult uh transition while with the histogram um
okay
yeah it just shows that there is a shot uh change at the end but even for dissolves
i don't have examples here but um there is not a strict uh transition
mm-hmm
uh it's continuous for dissolves
it's continuous for dissolve yeah
okay
yeah okay
but an anyway it's difficult i mean in th in in in general
dissolves is uh yeah
yeah i understand
okay
because sometimes you have some dissolve you could imagine they are part of of of a scene and uh so
yeah
but of course when you have cuts you can see they are easy to detect right i mean like something yeah
yeah okay
yeah
so uh yeah so with the motion basically the motion tried to estimate well the motion between two frames
okay
right if my image is there but after it's there and it looks at how many points c are well matched
okay
okay
so you can see that like somebody speaking and so and so before the sh before the shot you can see that usually there are like ninety percent of the points at least
right who have some motion so uh
hmm
but then after suddenly if you go from one frame and you try to match all the points here with like a translation
mm-hmm
plus the zoom plus maybe some rotation
mm-hmm
you c you can find anything well right
hmm
so basically you would see that the number of points maybe only ten percent of the points you can match well so it's easy to detect
okay
and uh after you can see that indeed because it's a long shot and it's almost like a flat plane
you can do a very good registration through the number of points
yeah
okay
is very high i mean the number of points that are matching
we'll see
okay
uh and here you basically here with a histogram uh you can see it very flat
but of course you should go from this histogram to this which is essentially green
you have this big uh measure which is here uh the chi two i don't know whether this is what you implement is used in the no it's
see the cut
no no now it's uh well for the video you saw it wa it's bhattacharya
it's bhattacharya
okay
okay
yeah so yeah and you have maybe a one image with a um adaptive threshold i think
you had something like this right
yeah
just to explain uh how
okay set the beginning
yeah uh
yeah you see like here
yeah
so there is the idea is having a sliding window
mm-hmm
um we have already all the data that is on the graph
okay
and then to detect uh the the the the changes we we do a calculation um with points under this sliding window within this sliding window
and uh we calculate so what do we here
um
in fa we want to detect that uh this points in the middle is higher than uh
alpha times the maximum of the other ones
th
okay
exactly yeah
of the other ones
alpha
alpha times the maximum of the other ones
okay
so the of course if it's you are not a maximum you are not going i inside the window you are not the max
anyway you are not going to be to be above uh alpha times the max of the others right uh because alpha is low lower than one
the c
okay
uh
but if you are in the maximum already and at this point we check simply if uh this value is alpha times the the max of the other points
like for instance yeah
let's say these points here
like for instance here i i see six but i don't know whether this was for bhattacharya or for uh chi s chi two
okay
okay
um i maybe for chi it's it six but uh yeah but uh for bhattacharya it's for the tests i did it two point four
yeah
yeah yeah yeah
two point four yeah so it's a bit less because the amplitude is much smaller yeah
yeah
yeah
hmm
uh yeah
okay
so you can uh it was not so just i mean because the motion i mean it was uh in the shot we've seen
no
f because f especially with chi two square it r the amplitude it's much bigger than with bhattacharya right
yeah okay
uh you can see that it could go to seven hundred and when it's there is nothing it's can be zero
mm
with bhattacharya it's between zero and one so you have not so much amplitude
okay
um but uh still uh in some of the v these videos for instance even if we gon go now if we want to
but now for the kayak case i don't know
uh at some point targeting two kayaks and it's moving quite fast towards to other people
i don't know what happened there if it was detected as a shot transition or
uh i in the the first shot
yeah yeah
yeah i saw that it was detected as a shot yeah
it was it as a shot okay
i was uh wondering yeah yeah maybe
you want to see now
okay
but he didn't okay
but here for instance you understand so we can show this tomorrow to uh to the people at the ci cinetis meeting i mean to
yeah okay
okay
i will look to have a connection
right
yeah okay yeah we need a connection that's true
okay
yeah
and we need a laptop or you have yours
yeah that's true
yeah i can bring my laptop if necessary yeah yeah
okay
i'll i'll bring it okay so it's it's done
okay
it is uh okay
this is idiap laptop so you can u okay
yeah
so here in fact after twelve um i don't know if it's i think it's twelve frames
well yeah but normally there is a a burning if you c maybe you can play the shot or
uh okay
yeah
it's strange i mean maybe you play yeah if you play the the video well insi at the beginning i don't know what's happening
oh yeah maybe you're burning but
oh there is no ha ha
i didn't uh ha i didn't have time to the the real media
ah you didn't generate the okay the real media
okay
but um yeah it's complicated
well no i mean here i can see that it was it was detected as a single shot
yeah here we can see that yeah
okay
i was because here you can see that the motion uh here is uh you know he is uh doing a zoom on the two kayaks here
at two point four
mm
yeah
and then there is translation on the right yeah
yeah and then he's doing quite a fast transition from these to another one
mm mm mm
mm 'kay
and i was wondering whether so if you well though of course it's true that it's mainly water
so maybe the colour is indeed uh quite but you know as a kayak is entering quite fast i mean you can have quite maybe good distance
hmm
i can see uh there is another programme that can see
hmm
but i see that it seems to be how many shots do you have indeed de de detected
uh the n. uh
it's i think it's f there there are five normally
six yeah the one is uh maybe so you did it with with what by the way
if we put expand all
okay
it's with the images i gave you or okay
yeah
the other one i had problems converting uh uh the video into d. v. x.
hmm
yeah
and then uh so i used the programme from uh software from sebastien p. p. a. p. m. to a. v. i.
ah to regenerate an a. v. i. file okay yeah yeah
hmm
because yeah one thing uh maybe we will talk about that is the library uh
it's uh it doesn't uh compile anymore on debian machines and yeah some maybe some work has to be done on this
okay
hmm
i don't know why this uh image doesn't appear this is the um um the frame that is uh uh extracted to be the shot key frame here
this one is this one the middle one
so i don't know what why it doesn't appear but it just uh a simple problem in the get frame
okay yeah
yeah
but what i can show you now is a little programme if we want to be um very precise about so it's ma get frames
okay c. g. i. here
and we were interested in around what di do you want
around six seven seconds
yeah i mean initially i don't know why there is a a shot detected
okay
uh if we do next
oh
yeah
there is something wrong
yeah yeah
oh yeah
so it detects
ah okay so the okay so the here is an image number
there was some burning
yeah in fact yeah that's why i said it's it's a frame number
in your programme
ah okay okay yeah
uh w i don't know why yeah yeah yeah
it's a frame number
okay okay so then this
this is a frame number this is in second but i i kept the frame number
so but it's in seconds or it's
it's twelve frames zero seconds
okay
okay yeah okay okay seconds plus number
okay
and the next is eleven seconds and twelve frames
yeah
okay so basically what has been uh yeah extracted is yeah this point rather than okay so this is normal okay
yeah
hmm
yeah
so if we do every second uh i d the middle frame is uh this one thousand
okay
do you thi it's another kind of browsing page
but uh to be more precise about uh to to check maybe the this yeah exactly yeah yeah
okay
okay
okay like transition something that is okay
anyway you go back to one frame around f one sixty for instance i don't know
hmm
and and there is yeah that's it you know
okay
ah okay
understand
prev
okay
you see that there is uh okay it's not a shot change it's a motion actually here
yeah it's motion yeah it's not a cut
yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
yeah but i was thinking that maybe it could have been
yeah i s yeah
but it's true that it's mainly water when we see things so it's yeah it's not such a big uh but yeah
sometimes i mean you can have various things hap i mean just think about more action movie and thing like this
mm 'kay
well sometimes it's very difficult so focus usually there is no problem
people say this is a cut this is not a cut but like for dissolve even sometimes
mm
you know
people may it's people may have some trouble i mean this is a dissolve this is not this should this should be labelled as a transition or not
yeah
mm-hmm
some people will say yeah but it's part of the thing or uh for instance in like in um also in uh
come on uh advertising usually
yeah
because the shots are very short in advertising usually it's uh very fast and so sometimes
okay mm-hmm
yeah
yeah when you have an incrustation like last time what what should you say it's it's yeah it's a change of
when you have yeah the the goal results uh then yeah in fact it's not a shot change
but uh
hmm
yeah
yeah i mean it's a so sometimes very difficult
yeah
yeah
a at least what i can see that currently like for cinetis uh for instance if it's to do colour correction or for instance if it's too black
hmm
too a bit whiter i think this type of things should be fine
hmm
because basically it's even if they are not real shots they are not so interested if it's not real shot
yeah
maybe after they have this and they may say okay just by looking at least the summary
so maybe for the summary we could do better uh key frame extraction for instance
but by just looking at the key frames and so on they may say okay
from this shot to this shot we apply like uh specific um colour enhancement algorithm or restoration algorithm or uh to improve uh the brightness and something like this right
yeah
and uh so i think for them this is fine um after i yeah
hmm
so this would ma be made uh manually actually
when you say from this shot to this shot is using a graphical user interface someone who would do manually for each video
hmm
well maybe after i mean they would sh okay uh they would go directly and say select the shots from here to here
and they would say you apply this algorithm yeah
method yeah
hmm
so of course we could try to make scene clustering and so on but i'm not even sure that this is necessary for them at this point
hmm
because uh if they have a six minute movie if they have thirty shots
yeah mm
for them it might be easier to look at from here to here i apply this and they can do it quite quickly
yeah
and they have to do it an to do it anyway
because what's going to take time might be uh to select the type of restoration algorithm or the type of things
ah okay
hmm
so this might take more time than having to click two times on two shots rather tha tha than uh having directly a scene right
yeah yeah yeah
mm
okay
so so i think for them uh this type of things is going to be useful uh at least for this task
okay
if they want to do stabilisation it may not be sure of that
hmm
hmm
uh this is the right segmentation for some of these but so but this is another point which for motion stabilisation
hmm
as i said several time we are not we did not commit to provide anything
but of course if we can provide things we'll do it but uh yeah
hmm
so do you have uh more question or uh do you have a
no
uh i have look at the demo film and it's about uh
forty minutes and about uh
hundred and seventy three different shots so it's yeah
this is the one in the d. v. d.
maybe okay we can uh see a little bit if you want to play the
yes
and uh i don't know if this is a real sample d. v. d.
because uh this will make about uh five seconds for each shot so i think it's very short
well no it's okay
well i just i i i it's i think this is
no
i if this is to r to to to make a change in the colour light and uh they have a lot of uh shots
yeah but after i mean it may be more like a guy um i int i in an interface a guy interface
hmm
i mean where i mean if second select from shot one to seven
yeah okay
ah okay
yeah okay
uh this is a same seg they may do the grouping by themselves quite by looking at this it may take w w less one one minutes
okay understand
and i think it's anyway if it's too summarised after they may want to go inside uh to see whether there is not special things i mean so
yeah
uh because after it depends i mean if you give only one key frame per shot after i mean it's one hundred seventy images
okay
it's quite fast right and so i think and the hierarchical thing is good
hmm
because still you can check if you have some ambiguities you are not sure you could
okay uh in fact i didn't understand that
okay
but now i understand better that cinetis wants this kind of method to help them to restore and to apply the algori some algorithms to to to make a better movie
yeah
yeah
yeah yes
yeah at least yeah yeah yeah
yeah yeah yeah
okay
yeah
it's not for the client for the user who will uh maybe okay
hmm
well ultim ultimately i think this is the type of things but at this point we uh yeah
oh
maybe they can
okay
also but okay
i i hope uh that uh if it's a big success uh they will ask idiap to to provide something like this of course with some money or at least to pay a student or somebody for doing it
hmm
okay
mm-hmm
but uh yeah
of course this was ultimately i think one way of uh if you could provide like chapters or something like this
mm-hmm
indeed you could provide like the a. v. i. to the clients
and he may ask for special services or uh and even to just to watch the movie to have direct access to different parts and so on
hmm
mm-hmm
but it's uh i mean uh this labelling might be more easy to do for the client by the client
yeah uh okay
because he knows what they're i mean he we wants to have this and this and uh right so
okay
mm-hmm
ah okay yeah yeah yeah
mm
because he did the movie so he wants t okay to archive he wants to okay
yeah yeah he may want to organi yeah yeah
mm
otherwise i mean this but of but of course it might be easy to do a very simple software
this is yeah another mm
which would allow the user to select just the shots and give names
and after it would generate automatically some index and uh as a i suppose the client might be interested in such a such a things if he could uh generate automatically on the d. v. d.
mm
yeah
yeah
mm
yeah
mm
okay
but for and you could imagine that before sending in the d. v. d.
you could allow him to l to watch this type of interface and he would be able to do the selection
mm-hmm
say this is this this is this this is this this is this and when he would receive the d. v. d.
mm
yeah
yeah
he would indeed uh get already the chapters that he decided to put there
and this could be done by through internet
yeah yeah yeah
and i think this may it it's good that this is a demo like this
mm-hmm
mm
because i'm sure that they might be interested indeed because i imagine that some people
mm
mm-hmm
yes
from the client point of view and from the preparation of the movie d. v. d. mm
yeah
yeah yeah yeah
uh yeah so i think this is uh this is a very good uh and a yeah
but uh
okay i will play yeah
so this is a kind of service i don't know either they give it for free and uh
but uh
we had an arrow here or what
it's
sorry
but you see that sometimes even here it's a bit like uh it's for instance if people would like to have like some motion compensation
th
uh you i it could be proposed
yeah
mm-hmm
but for instance here it i wou it would be problematic to have motion
so i here it's fine to do motion compensation but stabilisation rather than yeah
but
for instance here it's it's it's it's
mm
yeah uh i think i think they made some uh special effect in this d. v. d.
effects
okay
uh there is two or three time uh you see you see the same uh same kind of uh scene uh just uh two or three seconds
if i go to menu there is something
ah okay so maybe like here for instance it is a just reproduced two times uh
yeah
hmm
do you know what this is
no old menu uh there is no menu in the d. v. d.
no there's no menu
okay
okay
there is just one uh one chapter and no menu
okay
so this is the same video a the the a. v. i. number one
yeah yes
yeah
yes
and on the on the d. v. d. i saw that there are some other stuff
uh
i dunno
this one
uh i think in the video there's two there's two video one is a real video and the other is a just uh introduction when you have the menu
the same
okay
oops
so this is vi okay
this video is about four minutes five minutes right
no it's uh thirteen minutes
ah okay so this is not the one that has been uh
no but yes this is the same but uh there was a problem when do the grab from the d. v. d. to the files
ah okay
okay
so this is why they have make two two files
uh
there are two files
okay i understand
but now i have one file also in the so you can process again one time
okay
run the okay
okay
it's it's it's real time right
um
i mean the processing
mm
yeah almost
yeah
i would maybe a less a little bit less than uh a bit more than real time maybe
a bit more than real time
well anyway yeah
i will have to check but if it's five minutes videos it's like done in yeah quickly
yeah
yeah normally it could it could go faster
but i probably it's probable that even for the project you would do some of the reprogramming
yeah
i mean to especially if uh we need to interface new uh um yeah or for just reading
yes
okay
hmm
components open c. v.
i mean the the d. v. x. and thing like this so it's uh uh so tomor anyway for this we don't know exactly yet
yeah
yeah
yeah
because it's not sure what they want to what the user's tools for reading d. v. d. and so on so
okay
yeah
yes
and s because i don't think this is so difficult now you have um already looked at the histograms and open c. v. computing distances and so on
hmm
open c. yeah
hmm
hmm
so if we want to do a special thing that probably runs fast it may be easier to do it directly and uh yeah
yeah
but uh but yeah the interface is very so the interface uses the output of your programme
essentially okay
yeah
so that we'll use the whiteboard
okay
so in fact yeah the interface is quite is quite simple to use
um for instance you see um on the uh on the u. r. l. i put okay i i disco there is m. m. m. dot idiap dot c. h. slash v. c. g. i. bin
slash video browser
okay uh slash video browser three frames
three frames dot h. t. m. l.
and then this c. g. i. programme ask the mm parameter c. video and m. equals cinetis okay demo one
in fact um i just explain how to put the data on m. m. m. but it's quite simple
mm
when you log into m. m. m. as with a c. c. s. s. h. for instance um so you just put it's working like this m. m. m. data
video browser
uh okay slash
and then
this is the name of the new directory you will create
demo one
and there stands there is couple of things well it's uh
this name so i will say this is video name so video name
dot a. v. i. you just because we need the a. v. i. so that we can uh
you can do the get frame
yeah we can do the the get frame
but otherwise it's not necessary
oh yeah no no no
otherwise it's not necessary
ye okay
oh uh f and also for the
oh no no you need you need to generate these images right
okay
yeah and this is no no no uh this is done on the fly
with get frame
okay
okay yeah
mm
so you need that you need uh the x. m. l. v so it's video name
okay
and i could data dot x. m. l. but in fact it's just a simple convention i w could have put nothing but i just put data
the it's a convention
okay
data and then video name
okay it's r. m. nine dot r. m. for other stuff
okay
but in fact yeah when i think now we could have uh
okay
yeah
only with uh extension you can you can see
yeah
yeah okay
but the the name of the video file is video name is uh it's the same as a directory
the name is no of in fact yeah is is yeah
as a directory yeah yeah
yeah is the same as the directory
it could have been video naming also but it's the same as a directory
okay
okay
yeah
and that's it actually
when you you u you do that
i did the same for kayak you say kayak in fact now it's kayak and then you can see
yeah yeah
okay
yeah
and this output yeah as your this output uh this file is an output from the mm the software the shot boundary detection software
x. m. l. yeah
on the shot
okay
okay
and it's a simple format i suppose like uh like you have scenes and shots and uh key s some time stamps
it's a very simple format yeah
yeah uh actually we
yeah okay
okay
uh yeah i don't yeah we cannot see
yeah
okay yes okay
so but you're yeah
it's yeah it's uh tha video scene shot
yeah i mean it it might be good to
yeah okay
it's hierarchical in x. m. l. and key frame time stamp and the and from the time stamp and the video location he knows how to get the frame
yeah okay
each of these frames
okay
mm
and if we do in fact i don't know yeah it's mozilla firefox view page source okay view frame source
okay okay
so every every frame on the f page is uh online
and every frame is stored into uh a b a backup in fact every frame um it's m. m. m. who manage this automatically
is is a
okay
so that um when uh you ask for this frame in fact we can okay i just view frame source
when i view image when i say view image
when i say view image on this frame
yeah
yes
up we go there and this is um in fact it's a perl programme that outputs in fa instead of outputting h. t. m. l. or text it outputs uh j. peg
okay
okay
okay
okay understand
from the video with a time stamp it outputs a j. peg
yes okay
okay
but on the on the on the server the original is a f video film
this is quite uh nice
and
yeah
okay
and this image is i this image is output uh outputted to the client
so for example you can change you can change a number to take which one okay
yeah exactly yeah yeah
that's what i did uh
okay understand
here
in the other yeah yeah
in the other application yeah
okay perfect
yeah i dunno
and who has a right to put who has a right to put data on the m. m. m.
yeah here
in this one okay
i f there are yeah the m. m. m. developers so i'm part of that but uh we could we could uh yeah it's not a problem
okay
yeah i think it's not well done yeah
okay yeah
yeah
um i wanted to saw to see to do s say something else
um oh yeah and the images are sent to your browser the client to this browser
okay
but um
yeah
but also kept in uh a directory in uh on m. m. m.
okay okay there is li local cache
exactly a cache
okay okay
i say backup but it's a cache
okay okay
um that's that's how it works
okay
so if we for example now we have the c the the case that this video is not correct because uh i have make uh event grabbing
so uh we need to remove the cache for this video or this is automatic
no no no it's okay
um for the cache uh
we have plenty of space on m. m. m. so the this is not a problem ah yeah for a new window
yeah
yeah but what i mean is i i i i i if i if i put the same video with the same name instead of this one
yeah exactly yeah
and it detects okay
they should uh different
yeah
so you go inside the get frame function you see where it i it saves it
ah okay
we need to remove them
and then there is a special naming convention and you can remove the but i it's c yeah it's true
yeah okay
okay understand
okay
yeah it's not a real uh usi usage
no
okay
because there it's in cache so that if i put another video with the same name they th they will happen again
okay
yes
yes understand
okay
ah okay yeah
yeah
they will uh appear this frames will appear
yes bec because this one i was uh
yeah if yo
if you have the same uh decomposition right
th this one was
yeah yeah ex if you have the same decomposition but
yeah
yeah but it may happen that uh for ninety fra ninety percent of the frame it's different
yeah
so you see it fine but suddenly you have one other frame they don't know what it is and where it comes from
right okay
okay but it's okay
but uh yeah on m. m. m. f now we don't have such many videos so
it's okay
okay
yeah yeah
yeah yeah
but if you put yeah in another directory uh then it would work or or a new naming convention with uh special uh yeah code uh
yeah yeah
hmm
hmm
oh you mean bac because it's it's it's the m. m. m. cache
yeah m. m. m. cache
mm
okay
so this means that when it's done if i go on my computer and i do the same it's not going to enter in my cache
but it's going to be already there in m. m. m. okay
yeah
on the m. m. m. yeah
but it it can go in the browser cache also
so it's th it's so it's not done on it's so it's not done online
mm
the first time is done online
the first time yeah but after it's it take okay
hmm
hmm
yeah you can see here yeah
okay okay
uh the first time is done o
i thought it was everything was generated on the fly th so
you know you see that
well here it's it was cache because i already pressed preview but now it's on the fly
yeah
yeah okay
okay
so it's quite quick
oh it's greek but uh okay
this
okay so i if you come back now you
and then if you come yeah
yeah yeah
because the images are already generated
okay but now you have s you have both cache
yeah okay
and maybe they are on the cache of this browser this computer
yes computer too yes to uh but okay
so okay
but it's fast
that's why it's yeah it was uh used with uh yeah sebastien uh did the c. function and uh yeah
okay
and uh the the is calling this uh c. uh executable and it was used with m. m. m. server with pierre a and the beginning when yeah
yeah understand
okay yeah
okay
okay so
okay
uh i ju just uh a question on the the organisation of the m. m. m.
um yeah yeah
so you don't have uh a part for specific uh project
every for example if we make a lot of uh film uh for cinetis uh all are on the top
yeah
i mean uh all the film are y you you don't have a separation for the film for cinetis or for the project and s
oh the movies or
yeah yeah yeah
in fact uh we we we could you know okay you know all these graphical user interface that you see uh okay
well you say video name equal all are on the same level
so could you say uh video name cinetis slash something
in fact okay
mm yes
or not
yes we could do that
okay
okay
we could put uh cinetis slash here and then a cinetis slash is the sa yeah it works
okay
you th okay
you think it would work okay
okay
but the uh th the point is this interface is uh i think six or seven files only
yeah okay
x. m. l. uh well it's per c. g. i. that output x. m. l. and x. s. l.
so it's it's not a big deal to to to make a new like a cinetis browser or you know video browser
ah
okay
to make
okay
if we need to make some special thing on the browser it's t
yeah we w we copy all the files and there is uh just one um one parameter one uh string
hmm
okay
that we need to know where this data is and we could pr create a m. m. m. data video browser uh cinetis or something else
yeah okay it's okay
y it's uh ex extensible and uh is
okay great
mm even if you would r change a c. g. i. for instance
let's assume that we say we don't do any scene thing then we could remove like for instance the scenes right
yeah
okay
yeah exactly yeah
mm
yeah
okay
i was thinking that here it says that you have online video structure correction
uh which means that
yeah but i it's not uh it was uh you know thi this is working the expand all but uh this is uh
okay
yeah
uh
work in progress
this is wish wishable uh functions
yeah to do list or something
okay to do this
on a video annotation on a video structure co correction
but i it's not easy on the web with h. h. t. m. l. pages to to do uh such corrections like uh video structure corrections for instance
okay
yeah
input
okay
no
for that you need it's possible maybe uh on interfaces like flash or java
uh but still uh i i i there is uh it takes bas more work and but i yeah yeah i mean it's good good point
yeah uh
mm
okay
yeah mainly the t webpage or for output
okay
no i was thinking
no because i was thinking if it's there i mean we could use it uh uh we could uh you see but uh yeah
yeah
okay
and all these uh file are only uh internal
this mean uh if i go t on uh c cintetis cinetis uh
no no
fro from outside we can view them
from outside of idiap we can access this
yeah from home i was able to access them
with a password or
no
well uh you we can make for for instance for t. s. r. t. s. r. uh videos
mm
alessandro uh asked me to do the same thing and we i put uh we had uh like a password convention
yeah
yeah
okay yes okay
okay
so this is possible to make for these videos
okay
nobody actually it has been downloaded several times and people there are some lawyers that are putting no
so it's not uh
yeah
well if yeah it is there is no possible productions for these videos
but yeah
maybe what i say i'm very tired
y
yeah okay
but uh if po yeah it's demo and uh one can say you have to guess the name to but uh yeah
yeah okay
yeah yes yeah okay
yeah yeah yeah yeah no no yeah
okay
no
but yeah it's good to
bu y yeah a good point uh about password protection issues uh or the privacy issues uh
hmm
yeah okay
yeah if we i yeah
it might be good indeed if we start d building some experiments like this still to have a password
okay
right yeah yeah
uh ha yeah all the framework is ready with a t. r. s. t. s. r. videos so
uh
yeah yeah
yeah yeah i understand yeah yeah
okay
usually what we do sometimes uh okay just to say something about password protections
sometimes
instead of having um
a purely secure directory we p we we put a co code number like uh so that it's quite impossible to guess instead of video m uh name equals kayak then we would have uh zero six seven uh five or
yeah
yeah okay
yeah yeah yeah yeah
you know two
and then this directory from outside we have to take care that okay not only the video name this u. r. l. is not accessible
but also we should take care that in fact m. m. m. it's in m. m. m. data video browser and this is accessible from outside
we should take care that this directory or in fact this directory is not listable you know you cannot list from outside uh with uh f. t. p. or h. t. t. p.
right okay
hmm
yeah yeah what's yeah yeah
yeah
hmm
okay
yeah simple things with privacy issues but uh i there are some methods and everything is possible to make things private
hmm
okay
i yeah i don't know if you want to add anything but i would say that for the c. code uh
yeah i i i just want would like to stress something is that um yeah
if you want want to use the new versions etcetera
i think uh we need to go a little bit through the code and i would be happy to to to help to to for instance the classes about video structure
yeah
yes
hmm
etcetera to put them yeah
okay yeah
and
yeah it was done indeed f to be more general than just to do the shot detection
hmm
so that's why the code is a bit more complex i think currently
yes
yeah okay
uh but uh
and the code is based on open c. v.
yeah in fact it's not there is no tosh i it was called vision lib to read uh to to extract one frame each frame of a video
yeah
you know
oh okay
so it wa from sebastien it was in the tosh library
but uh it's nothing w to do with tosh and it's using uh uh the open c. v. and uh some classes from uh jean marc uh for
yeah yeah
okay
just
okay
yeah
yeah bhattacharya distance etcetera
bhattacharya okay and so on okay
ah okay yeah yeah
okay
image processing
yeah it was the same the same ones as the one you saw uh in my code yeah
okay okay
image processing and stuff
so we can forget tosh and uh use uh input se the input reader for the the m. peg we can re lo use uh open c. v.
yeah yeah
we can forget tosh yeah
yeah
yeah
yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah definitely yeah
okay
okay
hmm
yeah uh okay
um so it's four thirty so we need one hour it's it's good
just if you want yeah
yeah i think it's it's good yeah
it's good
this is the parameters of the of the c. programme but uh usage
yeah
yeah
video in okay
yes
uh the output file x. m. l.
output hmm
output file dist it's the distance um between each histogram
uh yeah
so that if the x. m. l. uh you feel there is not enough um uh shots you can instead of reprocessing the video you you reprocess this file
okay that's good yeah
and also some other stuff s for instance alpha threshold we talked about is set to two point four and uh yeah
okay
okay
okay
yeah
so the uh the the step we always use one and it should be one because otherwise it's stuck between consecutive frames
yeah yeah okay
ah okay
okay
we can skip some frames
yeah
okay
yeah but uh it doesn't w yeah it it's better to to keep it one
yeah
okay
yeah but why is after i mean if there is a shot you don't know between because you dropped one frame
you don't know where is the sh uh the d the shot
yeah yeah yeah
yeah
so detection latency is about the um it's half of the windows tha yeah sliding window
sliding window
mm-hmm
option for key frame extraction okay
uh sub threshold yeah
yeah right
okay
leave it to one yeah
okay it's perfect
uh yeah
hmm
maybe i i will uh i will give you this file in uh as a rhy it's a kind of rhythmia yeah
i just for preparing this uh nice discussion
yes
yeah
m um i'm quite happy to to to do that i it's good when you do uh something that there is someone using it
i don't know i'm i'm sure that they will be well i hope they will be a of something like this yeah
yes
but uh but
yes
yeah
mm
at least yeah with the interface it's quite funny to to see um d that the q quickly you can do something in in yeah
the output
in thirty t if the video i ten is ten minutes in thirty minutes 'cause it's no not a lot of things to change
yeah
yeah the the browser
hmm
or even it can do it uh it can we can do it quite automatically
hmm
yes
yes
it can be done yeah
uh so just uh last question maybe uh so this makes a x. m. l. file
yeah
okay
this is the the programme to to generating the x. m. l. file and the the shot
this generates yeah
yeah
yeah
and uh with the kayak you have one problems you don't have the real media so this is another thing
oh yeah it
ho how do you generate the real media yeah
so the real media is uh yeah a parallel thing that from the a. v. i. you convert it into real media and it is done on windows
okay
okay
okay
okay
uh
so you have some special tools from uh from real media
yeah
okay
mm there is a a the free one is okay
you can use the free we have a license here at idiap but uh the if you want to pay
hmm
mm
you pay for options such as uh resize or cropping but in fact maybe we don't need that and uh it's called elix producer
okay
hmm
hmm okay okay
okay i heard it
yeah i forgot yeah yeah uh elix producer and and that's it
okay
you can you can i it it i
but uh anyway you need you need to have windows to make these
yes
so i will ask you or someone else okay
yeah
uh yeah
okay okay understand
and yeah with real media
okay
but this is this is made by a programme done outside idiap
okay
well this is you can buy or you can order for free on internet
this is yes right okay
this not uh idiap programme
no no no no for the real media
okay okay
and um you didn't see but the re the real media um is called via a real server
hmm
so it's r. t. s. p. the connection and i it's streaming video streaming so it's not h. t. t. p.
yeah
yeah okay
so that it can play uh smoothly and but we are still uh investigating for the video formats
yeah
mm
because um i it's not supported for instance uh uh in java in java applications uh etcetera
um
hmm
hmm
hmm
oh o o oh yeah you mean the java framework uh what uh mike presented
real media
yeah
we cannot play uh real media okay
real media so there are many issues about that but yeah
hmm
okay
okay
it's another problem
formats formats yeah
mm
yeah
okay so i think this was good to see the the tool and uh tomorrow we are going to re say most of the things
okay
thank you
but shorter i f i believe right i mean it's bad to explain
okay
yes
and i think maybe later w yeah we we can start doing simple
i think for test i can take the real demo and make the the full processing
yeah yeah yeah
yeah the full uh
yeah mi this might be interesting to see tomorrow
so i will
of course maybe there was the ah one hundred seventy shots or it's a lot
yeah
but uh after i mean at this point we do we have nothing we can do unless they know what they want to do with it right
yeah
yeah
okay
yeah that was a single video structuring but it's uh other level uh it can uh it's quite uh it's researched yeah
yeah yeah
hmm
yeah
but i think i think is it's too it's going very be very to be very good for them to visualise how you can organise things and maybe what they can do
yeah
how they and so this is important
yeah last thing uh this is a kind of uh x. m. l. that is outputted
so so it's uh the structure is such as uh vi video segmentation with uh videos in begin and then for each shot you have an i. d. well this is the terms from m. peg seven convention
okay
mm okay
i have some informations
but anyway
shot begin and end
uh a sh the shot key frame that is the middle here
okay
uh sub shot
and uh in this in this the begin and end the number is the for example the end is zero dot twelve twelve is uh this frame too yeah
yeah you're right
twelve frames
okay
and in fact that's what i output in uh on the yeah i think y on the interface
okay
okay
mm-hmm yeah
okay
and there is only one sub shot because uh w yeah
okay
yeah initially yeah
there was there was problems with detecting the sub shots etcetera
what what
well we didn't because you tried to do something
but uh yeah well
yeah i tr well uh not with this one but yeah
i tried to code some stuff uh it but uh i'm not so confident in the way uh it is uh coded
okay
yeah like for instance if we need to find sub shots
usually it it for instance is better to have the whole shot to decide on how to build the sub shots
yeah
but it's true that maybe i if you store all the distance at that the distances we could do some basic stuff
yeah
but we yeah even we should uh for instance for the videos uh for the spectral clustering for the clustering
okay
here uh i store the consecutive the distance between consecutive histograms but we could uh store the matrix that's yeah
okay
yeah yeah yeah
yeah yeah yeah
yeah yeah
that's the thing yeah
and then uh yeah
uh
okay
and i think i there are many possible things with uh spectral clustering
mm
just what what
but but the uh with um there is one parameter that is very c wha i can't remember what is the parameter uh
ah th the gap you mean or no
yeah
oh no you mean in the bhattacharya distance
no no no no the in the the gap to find the the good number of clusters is so sensitive uh
yeah
yeah yeah
yeah
yeah
yeah
hmm
yeah anyway
it's it's a bit later in the in the report
okay
so anytimes yeah i would be happy to to to help you with that
yeah okay
okay
so
it's okay
it's okay
yeah yeah you can we can go
a lapel is also there
no
okay
okay
okay so should i start
yep
yeah
yeah
okay
so i think it's better to first have a presentation of my work and then we can discuss uh with this crash in temp in temp uh what we can do uh for my future to to continue my research
because apparently i i will have serious problems okay
so i will start with the presentation of my work
uh you can be sitting here itself and do the presentation
yeah
mm
okay
i start like this then
yeah that's better
okay so it's uh my g work is generally about uh using posteriors in uh speech recognition systems and uh somehow enhancing the estimation of posteriors
getting new posteriors which are havi which are more informative by somehow integrating some extra knowledge like uh prior knowledge and contextual information related to the problem and then use this posterior estimation uh uh method uh for designing hierarchical uh speech recognition system
so in this hierarchical arg architecture i will be able to uh integrate the extra knowledge at the proper level of hierarchy
and i will be al also uh able to uh combine different kind of uh knowledge or sources uh sources of knowledge i have
uh well as you know uh generally posteriors are estimated using uh neural networks and more specifically m. l. p. s in a speech recognition system
so uh time limited window of a speech signal is uh represented by some cepstral features
which are then processed by an m. l. p. and it gives us some evidence as in the form of pos phone posteriors
then we use these phone posteriors as features or as scores for for either just decoding or d uh uh n d training and inference training and then decoding
uh but we know that uh in this uh in this case we are not able to integrate contextual information uh uh line contextual information
and we are not able to integrate the prior knowledge we can have about phone use or about
uh words in the posterior estimation so the main motivation is to see if we can integrate this kind of extra knowledge in the posterior estimation
so what is proposed to solve this problem is to use a uh what we formally use in h. m. m. formalism which is called gamma uh state posterior
uh i uh as a posterior for uh training uh or decoding so it's uh well as you know it's a state posterior probablility in a h. m. m.
which is defined as the probability of being in a specific h. m. m. state at a specific time having the whole observation sequence and the model
so whole observation sequence means having complete contextual information and the mod uh and the model can encode some kind of prior knowledge for us by means of uh topological constraints
uh well you know it's uh this gam uh gamma posterior is written in terms of forward and backward h. m. m. recursions
and actually one way to use this uh gamma posteriors is uh using these posteriors as some kind of newer scores for decoding
so in this case it will be uh similar to hybrid method
um the the difference is that we do one more step uh maybe i can explain it better there
so we do one more step here and we uh here by means of another h. m. m. we introduce some kind of uh prior knowledge and contextual information
we get better evidences than what i we initially had here
and then we do the uh decoding and the and s more informative posteriors uh uh instead of this one
so we are expecting to uh the system to perform better and more robust to noisy cases
here you see uh some results uh and how uh how what is the effect of introducing uh reasonable prior knowledge
so different uh rows in this table are showing different level of noise and also clean speech and different columns are showing different kind of posteriors or gamma posteriors
so uh the the first column is showing the uh our baseline system
which is getting estimate of posteriors out of m. l. p. uh and then d using these posteriors for decoding
and the other columns are showing the performance of uh different kind of gamma
so uh gamma which is estimated using uh information about minimum duration of phonemes about
possible transition between phonemes and some kind some uh more prior knowledge like uh which wo like uh which word is composed of which phonemes and uh g uh gram grammatical knowledge ab uh about transition between words and things like this
so as you see introducing more reasonable prior knowledge um will h help to have better performance in almo in almost all the cases
and here i compare the performance of the gamma base system with the standard h. m. m. g. m. m. system
which is based on uh doing decoding uh using uh likelihood as the scores
and the difference is that our system use uh is using posteriors for decoding
so as you see s uh it's working uh better than the standard h. m. m. g. m. m. system
and finally the conclusion is uh he here we saw how we can get uh some more informative posteriors by introducing extra knowledge like prior and contextual information
and then using this uh uh p posterior estimation method to design hierarchical uh speech recognition system which we're which which the goal is to have a better
more efficient and more robust system
so if you want now we can discuss about um uh the crash and the loss of data
so uh well i lost all the posteriors i was i uh i used as input uh for my system
so the gamma are somehow estimated or computed on top of posteriors
and now i don't have any posterior and uh probably the scripts generating that posterior so what i can do okay
uh you go to the table you have there like the big table you told and then we can discuss
okay
okay
so which i think i have all the gammas no
especially gamma full models i have
gamma full model but uh what about other ones and what about the f posterior because because i i uh you know
yeah posteriors
i cannot uh stop my resea i i may do something else you know in future with this uh and well i need posteriors to
now you need the different method from how from gammas you can generate the posteriors
yeah
and posteriors
even you have those three state perform gammas also you have all these
uh no no i don't have them there were all under temp
you you we have that because you uh stored them
huh
ah okay
okay
so
so now yeah now you can write another paper if you can
yeah you can go back up to the feature you know
yeah
yeah
maybe maybe some other m uh p. h. d. student should be hired to work on you know the generating gamma
up to
mm
gammas to posterior
uh i was just um let's talk about little about this presentation itself the slide number six
six okay
okay how you feel it is important that you're taking the context of the whole utterance
how important it could be
is it not a possibility that you're having less context
less context what you mean
instead of having context from one to capital d. which is for the whole utterance which doesn't make much sense in general
uh
yes
so what is a possibility that you can cut the context instead of having the context from
yeah
you mean a smaller context instead of this
that's right
might be left or right everything there but not the whole context
because it's it's a fact that when you are having one utterance
mm-hmm
so it one utterances link up full sentence or something and there might not be much breaks in it
mm
yeah
so in that sense it doesn't make sense that you are going too much in the past and then you are trying to compute something which is not related
yes
yeah
yeah b well even they can have some information which are not so meaningful or uh which are not related
yeah well but then i will have the problem to find the optimum amount of context
mm-hmm
how much context should i take
kind of let's say idea is usually hundred milliseconds or one second
i two hundred
two hundred millisecond
mm-hmm
so but for numbers i think it may be okay numbers hardly yeah
yeah numbers it might be okay because most of the sentences might be three seconds or something
one two
even less than that yeah
mm
just few words like so but if for or something
yeah
okay
like if it's really long sentence of ten seconds or something you may not really need so much con
that m that match of context to computer commas
i know it's really computationally very intensive also like if you use
mm-hmm
okay
yeah that's a good idea
that's reasonable
okay so when we are talking about them then my story they are the worst i think
mm
so pretty much all the posteriors are from you only
yeah
yeah
i cannot generate posteriors
yeah
and and you don't have uh scripts for
so there is
i don't have the c. files also presently with me
sk
ah okay you do you have just your no
mm-hmm
yeah
no
my said that enough is enough
and what could happen if you don't even have your
oh you know
yeah and then i then i would have taken two years extension
mm-hmm
yeah it was it was pretty scary but let's see what happens
mm
but al for your case you don't need really complicated posterior you just need some p. l. p. s and then
yes
yeah you can then you know because if most did it on what numbers and one of couple of c. t. f. experiments right
n yeah i uh for c. t. s. petr uh still i think have he didn't uh lose anything so
no but but ma he's he may be linking to matthew i guess because matthew got the wav files
no no no no no i uh probably might
but you got the all the wav files so
uh
yeah but the wave file is th that's in the temp only right
so so the only thing is that i can recover it back from berkeley
yeah so that's what i'm saying like
uh yeah
icsi mm-hmm
yeah yeah
so if he got features then it's okay otherwise if he has to generate again he can't generate
because even um petr has lost a lot
yeah
he's having only the results with him
so
he doesn't have the files the real the real s ones
ah
because
no everything we w if th if they say that we cannot recover it then i can quickly get it back from icsi in a couple of days
i can put all the system back here
yeah
okay
mm-hmm
but uh
but the p everybody has features in temp only most of the time all the c. t. s. features or c. t. s. wav files so
yeah
mm yeah
so forget about c. t. s. at least now i think because it's again
yeah because even to download that much of data
mm
it takes at least one or two weeks
yeah a lot of time no it i can dow obviously downloading is another thing
the only thing is that i have to do is that they have uh data in uh one particular structure
but segmentation
mm-hmm
so i have to first of all you know organise create tar files and then i can get it back here
mm-hmm
mm-hmm mm-hmm
but you say do you need to do some segmentation also on top of that so
and then you have to get the l. p. p. l. p. features and
yeah that i can get all those things
okay
because tho those files are also very big they are not single files
all th all those m yeah
yeah but the those files can be recovered easily only thing is that uh now if they had to say that we cannot recover it
they're
so there should not be any break
yeah the we can wait at least one or two weeks for this because it's
uh uh one uh one uh day one o one two days like this week i can wait and see
mm-hmm
if they cannot recover it then i can just get all the data from icsi and put back the c. t. s. system
but still i think we can't really do these things before icas because yeah
no we cannot do
so maybe we can concentrate work especially on numbers now and then we can go to c. t. s.
mm-hmm
mm-hmm
yeah
so in numbers case what do you really need like
mm just uh po uh pi uh posterior estimated using p. l. p. features for number which i think we can we can rate it
mm-hmm mm-hmm mm-hmm
yeah basically yeah w we need to generate again p. l. p. s but wave files are there
mm-hmm
mm-hmm
yeah p. l. p. numbers ninety five database is there fine
uh p. l. p. they're also last
yeah p. l. p. s
yeah
okay
everything that
everything is lost
and uh if if you really ask me even the structure which was there real every point by point how p. l. p. is well generated
mm-hmm
that information is also not there
but you're generating p. l. p. s from
yeah but the parameters which are exact
um
mm
mm-hmm
but at least you f
hopefully ninety five percent i know but that five percent
yeah
yeah that you can del
and then we we need to train the new rates because m. l. p. training needs to be done and then only the next step will happen
mm-hmm
okay
so it's it's pretty pretty hol holding is stupid
whether we can replicate the results whatever results you are showing whether we can replicate them or not
presently it's it's not known
but at least yeah you have something to verify their wa
yes
yeah
so so p. l. p. s or these are all thirteen just only p. l. p. s not deltas and del
you
uh nowadays not that one
there is another problem for uh verifying these results because well for these results you know
the the configuration should not well i also saved the configuration somewhere in the temp
mm-hmm
so exactly how many stays for decoding and which kind of language model and things like this
mm-hmm
mm-hmm mm-hmm
i i think i can remember almost all of them but f it's it's a bit uh uh stressful
mm-hmm
yeah
but if you got something from hemant or matthew then i have those number of stage
yeah but h he doesn't
like we have then you know like it's only for only close uh d. c. l. k. c. l. they have
one one
no no no no he is using different setup i think
no he he got from you only
he doesn't use our setup
do you use our setup for the number of states
uh y m yes
for the gamma estimation
ah
i think so yeah so then i have those number of stages
okay mm-hmm
mm-hmm
no no those things i'm also having because they were done two years back
yeah
ah okay
anything which is done in the last two years is the one which is
so
lost
ah
so you didn't have any p. for these p. l. p. s no p. l. p. s or p. files from p. l. p.
nothing
so bu what about this noise levels like we have noise wav files in da da com databases
the there's also in com com database yeah
mm-hmm
so we have directly f wave files with uh particular noise
yeah that's right
ah ok see
no th those things are not disturbed
no no but they're they're they're down in the database section
nothing related to the database has been disturbed
no but but i think uh de
except the switchboard
yeah except switchboard but the switchboard also we have it but only thing is that we don't have all the data we need yeah
but
hmm
but the problem is like all this i think it may not be there in database i guess
no no it is dead
no they're there
oh okay
because it was that now
you called the noise x. database
no no it was it was pre written there
no no it w o ori originally done
ah okay
it's in the database itself
even with uh s. and r. s
that's right yeah
no no it is even in d. v. d. form we have it that the
ah okay then it's okay
ah
yeah so it that is not a problem
so y you it's not that you all the no
no i didn't do it myself
yeah with s. and r. different s. and r. s
no no no
means at l yeah that part is less uh scary
yeah so at least we have wave files so now we can generate anything in the p. l. p. s or so at least
yeah
so the things which are related to your p. l. p. can be done i think it's it's not such a major problem
yeah
okay
yeah so so as the conclusion there is no major problem except regenera yeah which time for i guess
no except uh except time
so you tha m. l. p. needs to be trained and uh p. l. p. features
those
how much time we want to spend again to get
mm
mm
so it's kind of one and a half days work kind of to generate the new files
mm
but for all these s. and r. s so that's also again
mm
yeah yeah
yeah that will aga means it'll light up that's it
hmm
yeah
but all all of it is doable in three four days time
mm
well i also had the of generated posteriors or gammas or things like this which i should regenerate
mm-hmm
i have the uh scripts but uh well it takes time it's c. p. u. and regenerating all these things but okay it's okay
mm-hmm
mm-hmm
so there is no major problem except time
deadline of two weeks for icas
okay
mm-hmm mm-hmm
and if i don't have to generate any new results i'm also on the other side then
yeah it's
but if i need to generate new results then and anyway there is emotional loss so scripts and code everything written that is
no the thing is like you can't really write this k i suppose uh the code is the real problem scripts is okay like yeah
no
yeah yeah
even scripts also the configurations or you do if you forget something some factor or something it's really
because it's
yeah
yeah
yeah
means losses are emotional as well as whatever it is there
and bla bla but it's tragedy
hmm
so
so raid five you have told to the
mm
mm-hmm
they are they're it's it's it looks like if you get three disk gone
then it's very difficult to get it well like fine if it's one disk it's fine because at least one is having the uh mirror mirror
mm-hmm
which disk
uh three disk
no one disk there is no problem
so it will recache on the mirror
um but uh if the three disk are gone it's very difficult
mm-hmm
so i don't know how it went like usually while as soon as one disk fails it should be replaced actually and uh i dunno
so it should be replaced by
mayb yeah otherwise it uh it'll go on destroying other disks
ah ok
so i so the one so they i don't know how it happen you know such a thing like usually as soon as one fails
it actually notifies the you know the system administrator or makes certain kind of um noise
mm-hmm
yeah
uh yeah to to make sure that you know it has to be replaced
so w uh if it the disk is not replaced then it w it'll fail
hmm
it will ri
it uh then then it uh there's a internal recovery if it just r replace the disk there
mm-hmm okay
it's it it can internally it can quickly recover everything into that disk
mm-hmm
mm-hmm mm-hmm mm-hmm
uh so so it's like you know if you have a mm mm uh um if you have
it's kind of like essentially if it is like hundred twenty hundred hundred g. b. data space
then it essentially will have a hun two hundred g. b. only stu visible data f to you
but then it can we as soon as they replace one of those hard disk i it can it can from the other one it can recover everything on that
uh it will have measures like
inter internally it can do that kind of thing but if the th if the three disks fail
mm
then it's it's it's yeah a really difficult job i don't know how it can be recovered
uh
probably the mm one way that they extend the har the hard disk to the people who are experts
and they do like sector by sector block by block they try to recover
mm-hmm
but that's it's very expensive
hmm but like this
uh th simple yes the simple thing might cost you minimum ten thousand euros fifteen something like that
but even this maybe really huge data also
was it insured any idea
i don't know whether it was insured
i don't think insurance company will give
no no insurance can take care of uh means anything can be insured in this world nowadays
mm-hmm
i think maybe some companies definitely do insure you can't really have so many backups
mm-hmm
but it still means one thing which is a mystery to me whe why temp one and temp two were residing on the same hard disk physical
no it does because it was not temp one temp two but they have the same mm it has three g. b. three disks hard disk category
mm-hmm
mm-hmm
and so you can go up to fourteen or something like that but it can be on the same yeah
mm-hmm mm-hmm
yeah so it means
which just partition these uh
but so it tries to put if you it tries to uh quickly put things uh if this way that so that and but only thing that only one has the mm um backup
so that
hmm
keep taking up the backup there
mm-hmm
so it puts everything mm quickly it can decide wherever it wants to put so it's faster to do that way
no no no what i'm saying means temp one and temp two could have been different systems altogether
mm
no i think that uh soft name they were given the
i'm saying they could have kept differently
yeah
but then what are the use of raid then
but
no raid on both they systems was the problem
yeah
no but that is what the raid can allow you to have keep up to fourteen hard disk
it can allow
hard disk there there were already five hard disks right
yeah so it they have five and you can go up to fourteen if you want to keep there
mm-hmm
mm-hmm
and it can still work and it takes the and the way it look like it it's still tolerant you know
the way it it usually it does it if you one this crashes before uh i uh um if it uh replace quickly then no problems
but uh we we
otherwise unsaved data will start the first thing is to get lo lost
hmm
mm that's the thing
yeah not everybody is going to be scared of temps
i um
yeah no temp
hmm
temp is no well it's a i think they can they can they can do
uh so then then
because th th some some of these people that expert there are couple of experts so they learned itself
mm-hmm
so
hmm
if they can easily recover it well
mm-hmm
to do this kind of thing you know
but is it really costly the system is
yeah it depends on the job
you know sometimes the small hardware thing they might do it to then you know five thousand euros and all
but if it's very much detailed work
they will just i it the system the the whole thing starts like this that you have to give your credit card number and sign a form and then only they will start touching your hard disk
no no no no no
hmm
no no no
i checked over the net it's not the way
you d you send the things to them they will see if they can recover
yeah
then only they'll ask you that this is the quotation
no no bu no th they will
but if there is no no if they cannot recover they they will send it back
no no that's what they say like you do it then send it the hard disk then they will say okay we can do it
mm-hmm
and then if you do it with only with only yeah
no no no first they'll give you a quotation
the they won't go we ho without that
mm-hmm
it's not means it's a wrong information
yeah
maybe at least they will give some number others like they can
yeah yeah because in the beginning what they say that send us the thing we'll look at the things
yeah
yeah
if it is recoverable we will tell you what is the quotation and if it is not recoverable we will send it back to you
then what did they estimate of that
hmm
but means f and uh i if they they cannot recover it then then what they will they won't charge anything from you for the inspection
yeah
i think that is yeah
yeah
yeah at least they they will know m beforehand i think uh
but
that's right
yeah
no it it is up to you know
means looking at uh how much failure has happened
yeah yeah
accordingly they will tell you whether they can recover or not
and in fact if they they can go a lot but you know
they can go block by block and look into it and try to recover but um that matthew will want to go or not is the question
mm but even like how much important data l sometimes it's just m. p. threes or something so you don't really need to
yeah
yeah
yeah
yeah
and it's like forty tera
fo four tera no
four tera that's forty tera
four tera it's like
mm-hmm
so how much is four tera four thousand gigabytes
yeah four thousand gigabytes
yeah
okay
four thousand g. b. s
not much
yeah it
yeah that's a that's a big
but now we got something like uh more than fift
is it raid one has more compared to raid five
mm um
no raid five is better i think
it l it levels
no raid one is having exactly f fifty percent capacity is utilised
it's copy
uh ah okay
two copies of the same thing will be existing
mm-hmm
that is a raid one
but raid five is then then twenty percent copy only
that's right
yeah uh
raid five is twenty percent
ah
it's not the other way
no
hmm
so raid one is exactly it's means that's lot of wastage of resources but it's more tolerant
mm-hmm
and there is no kind of or anything nothing exists there
mm yeah it's a
so the disk which has crashed that cannot be recovered
that uh disk which has not crashed it can be recovered completely
means if both the disk have crashed for the same data you cannot recover anything
hmm
yeah yeah
yeah yeah
if one disk has crashed crashed then you can recover everything
yeah it will be then the other disk
yeah it'll be in the other disk
so that is raid one
and hemant how uh how do you want to go about it
t
if you are given a choice you want to take raid one or raid five or a simple laptop
mm
no i will say how do you like to go about with icas
ah
well i i think w after this meeting we can t we can try together to regenerate this
well uh p. l. p. s i think th they should be first regenerated then posteriors and if by the end of week we could have posteriors
mm-hmm
yeah
then it's not that difficult i can easily regenerate the gammas and do all the experiments again
yeah
to what are the experiments you need to do
maybe it's a
what are the new experiments you are having in your mind
again
uh mainly th there would be some experiment to check how the system is robust against these uh tuning factors like uh language mod uh language modelling
scaling
scaling factor language scaling factor and inversion penalty
mm-hmm mm-hmm
mm-hmm
this will be the main new issue and uh well
mm-hmm
but do you feel that is paper material
yeah the new thing in the paper and well some
and also maybe like this noise is he was
no in these cases but
but the one which you have reported means you want to report something more than that
well actually actually this w this was not in the paper
mm this is not in the paper actually d
i put it in the presentation but it's not in the paper
ah okay
this is
uh the paper was just for clean speech but since i had the results before and i cannot copy these things
mm-hmm
okay
mm-hmm
because i t uh i talked with herve and he said okay
actually the numbers are not uh very reasonable because they are just thirteen p. l. p. features and uh we have to have at least something which is known for people
mm-hmm
i mean they are expecting something around ninety eighty seven or uh something like this
mm-hmm
mm-hmm
uh so i anyway i had to re to redo all the experiments but now it's a little bit more difficult
hmm
mm-hmm
because before i had posteriors and now we have two more steps p. l. p. s and and and posteriors so
yeah
okay
at least now he can know a full system setup from
so might be what i can do i can give you the setup and you can you can generate from bottom train m. l. p. test m. l. p.
yes thank you very much
yeah
thank you very much uh
so now mainly like uh thirty nine p. l. p.
you were always thirty nine no
mm
mm i was using thirty nine yes
not sure but then why did this features you gave me like they're thirteen
oh m i wanted i wanted to extend this uh well actually the paper we wanted to write was uh for icas was something related to multi stream gamma
you truncated them to
no no no no these these these ones like the
but okay okay
uh will i i will explain
so tha my plan was to have two streams and i i i well
yeah
i so i i thought that okay i one stream will be p. l. p. and the other will be delta p. l. p. s
ah okay
you did it on only one
hmm
ah
ah okay
so this was one part of experiment so single stream and then i wanted to combine deltas with this and have another table so that was why
deltas
ah okay
ah ok
but actually because you know the numbers and the study is not sh i it's not showing uh strong results
anyway results are not very important but they should be within a range of uh acceptable numbers
so then uh for now i think it's better to instead of doing p. l. p. and delta p. l. p.
i can uh have single stream of thirty nine p. l. p. s and then combine them with traps just to have
hmm
yeah those results only you reported in interspeech no like uh thirty nine p. l. p. results
yeah thirty nine
and they were then
uh
uh they were but they were less than ten percent or so
yeah yeah yeah yeah
yeah
mm-hmm mm-hmm
now even the clean speech you are getting
so what is this result
this is related to your um m. l. m. i.
no no it's interspeech
the okay
no no this is just
these numbers are full p. l. p. thirty nine okay
ah okay mm-hmm
but just to make things clear in the presentation to show more steps
mm-hmm
what is a triphone gammas
he use the triphone m. l. p. and get uh
try yeah
ah okay
your your m. l. p.
yeah yeah
no
uh n no he gave scale to me then i generated gammas
no i i gave yeah
even
okay
even uh
even if you
but those gammas will be same as uh s normalised scale likelihoods right
yeah it yeah
no no no no
no no
then the they're through that data uh from through
the they're differently
no
yeah
yeah because i have triphone g. m. g. m. m. s and h. m. m. s
okay
th
so he gave me scale likelihoods of triphones
uh not uh scale likelihoods
uh yeah scale like uh scale likelihoo from uh t uh m. l. p.
scale likelihood
posteriors
scale likelihoods
from
from triphone memory
g. m. m. oh m. l. p. scale likelihoods
yeah well yeah so i j i d do i did try it yeah th that's how you do that
you're you are having posteriors there right
you divided by the
okay
hmm
okay so it's scale likelihoods
so then again i will pass through full network
then i can generate triphone gammas
okay
and full network what was the r ch architecture
it's like
it's no no it's uh it's just g. m. m. word models
ah okay
you have all the connections to between all the words like hmm
mm-hmm
mm-hmm
so what are the other things we need to discuss
so then first thing is like we need to generate p. l. p. s and then
all these s. and r. s p. l. p. s
yeah
it's amazing that everything was under temp
hmm
no but i think what i think there is still some data which is recoverable
at least they could give us time to i think that uh the most of those things should be there
i can hope it already if they could
no it was there on uh like uh yesterday morning also like even
one day after the crash
yeah
so i was running some experiments and then it was okay but it's readable only so i can't write anything so
yeah
mm-hmm
no you don't have to write but you could read no
yeah so but we don't know like we thought like i thought it's recovering so maybe by tomorrow i'll get everything so
uh so if you want a copy again you'll have
that's all be because of you
you came on wrong day from iran
yeah
you should had come on it would have been okay
yeah
anyway
but yeah still some people are in vacation so they will really
uh they'll get a shock of their life
yeah sileye will be back and he's not in vacation but he's in italy
pedro pedro also
might be the one kind of like if they have read their mails
he flies to senegal directly
yeah
so daniel is well in italy
yeah
hmm
but even all over the recent iteration iterate training set in temp
yeah everything is lost yeah
because like we we s how much we can copy because it's really so many iterations and even we thought of really completing minimal experiment also mm
yeah
yeah
yeah but it's a major loss no doubt
but at least yeah a script are there every scripts like at least scripts are there but so if if they can decode
the data on which we want to run the scripts is not there
yeah if they can decode at least hemant's p. files then hemant can
if they can yeah if they can give me my c. files then also it's okay
mm
yeah
mm
but c. files yeah
even if they give you p. files it's really better even you don't really need to ru run all the
yeah because i don't need to generate features also yeah
yeah it's amazing
i n i don't need all my p. files just three of them
yeah yeah you j just only like recent p. files at least
yeah
and what if we have some day a fire in idiap we will lose all the data
oh that is fire will lose all the data you know
mm i mean but they have well i i think w they can and yeah they can d you know store it somewhere
nowadays it's not the case
no no no
they physically also separate the things
physically uh yeah
yeah physically it is updated
but you know here we can easily have a fire because the everything is made of wood i think and it's small and
no i think there is sprinkler or something around here i hope so
yeah
but still i think i it depends
or it's sprinklers
uh in edinburgh they had that big fire and then
then what if their sprinklers don't work
even even sa several uh da buildings and all the computers in that building they all burned
but they have like three backups in the university so all these people they didn't really affect much
ah
uh-huh
no it's the university is maybe it's really big so they can afford for
yeah
yeah in fact they distributed the whole thing around
yeah they yeah yeah they want th they'll have backup in different and also in in some in underground
they may not have it in one place
they won't keep it at one place yeah
physically at different places yeah
hmm
so that like file proof or something yeah
mm-hmm
yeah
mm-hmm
anyway the good the conclusion is to have a back up and uh and c. d. at home
yeah maybe
yeah
no c. d. s are not enough like no
yeah something like that i can recover
c. d. s are not enough that's the problem
yeah how much uh
mm
because one c. d. is how much
no but
it's not even one g. b.
yeah
for example f phonebook i can recover everything on phonebook because i have it on the c. d.
so then c. d. s are not enough
hmm
mm-hmm
i wrote it once time to copy it to my home and so i have all the data of my c. d.
but i don't know if i had i copied all the numbers that are on that so
hmm
hmm
you're talking about datas or you're talking about
data itself
the whole feature to everything
okay mm-hmm
hmm
features segmentation every label file everything is there
i could recover it back from there actually but
but what about home directories or he also kept everything in uh temp
i don't know
temp
no no he wa he was having locked many things in the proper places
yeah
but in temp he wasn't having lot of important things yeah
all the experiments which he was running
but he he did mostly on numbers no
so at least if we can recover we we can read some of his stuff or something
no
mm-hmm
did you locate it
it is home or home speech or something
uh look what
look for any features or anything are there
no i uh
but what we'll do with the switches
no no he he maybe he might be using same p. l. p. features or something it they are different
no no no no no
okay that way it might be but the situation is that uh he he was generating his own p. l. p. features from his own scripts
we don't know it
uh his own
he was not using using doctor speech
ah okay is here he got uh his own
yeah
so he was like uh he was so i'd borrowed few of the things from him
yeah
the f. f. t. routine and uh reading the signal wave form
these things i borrowed from him and i changed and then i put it in my all programmes so
i i kept the backups but those backups are the them's also on temp
i didn't i didn't know that this this way it can crash because i thought maybe i can do a mistake and wipe out the things
mm
and then there is no backup
so i cannot blame anybody but i didn't know that the whole backup can itself crash
hmm
yeah
yeah
so now in in my life i will never believe anything which is temp
not
whether it is temperature or whether it is temporary
uh
hey
because just few few days back i took a backup of my laptop fearing the same thing
mm-hmm
but then i didn't realise that i should take a backup of
only good thing is that the numbers i think i pretty much can recover all the even the f triphone experiments
yeah
reverse
hmm
because i think i have kept those labels all those things in the speech directory
a p. file of it
oh then it's good you know like we don't really nee
so it's easier to it all back all those labels and everything yeah
so but your p. l. p. is also like
p. l. p. should be there
mm-hmm
i re should have kept the p. l. p. also somewhere tha
then we just need to run your neural net only yeah but p. p. p. l. p. s are like hardly few minutes li
p. l. p. is hardly anything yeah
mm
n mm the the extra work on is like you know converting the segmentations from monophone to triphone this kind of thing
then the all the scripts are there in the temp file that kind of thing
ah
i uh like no no no no no
which which scripts
from posteriors to s forced alignment
no what you do is like you have the segmentation to train that for monophones right
yeah
you can uh you can convert the same thing into triphone segmentation because there is monophone and triphone they are not different
yeah yeah
except that you're just going to give a different label to them p depending on the context
mm-hmm mm-hmm
mm-hmm mm-hmm
mm-hmm
so it's easier to convert that segmentation directly here rather than now ugh you know
mm-hmm
you say the point that if you lose one uh so uh so the thing is that i have to recover means i have to recover through the pho no monophone segment segmentation to triphone segmentation
and then
the whole thing
but but you still need to run all the nets no l
yeah it's okay
th that uh numbers it's very fast so it's no problem
it's
no but it's it's not i think at least it takes two hours or three hours i think
yeah so it's yeah
three years two to three years yeah
you can't parallel also that's the problem
yeah
but right now you the thing is that right now you know almost what is the uh like the which will give you the best is also you can cont instead of running it hmm
not in all cases that's the problem which people are facing
yeah
because everything was written then and there itself
means even if the optimisation has been done they did the optimisation there and they they worked on that started working on that
he
they didn't write it with pen or something on a paper or saying that okay this is the best optimisation
yeah
yeah
yeah
so for example if he want repeated all these results then he ju he need to use all ma hemant's p. l. p. configuration then that's really
yeah
because if i change my configuration and your results are somewhere else
yeah the results will be
then you don't you don't know uh uh well
anyway mm let's recover it
okay
ho let's hope the best
so how much time we have spent
i think i think we have spent
yeah for thirty five forty minutes it is
uh yeah
okay so this is good enough
uh uh thank you
okay
yeah
okay thank you
thank you thank you
okay
fine
okay fine
have a good day
you too
it's all
it's all we have to leave fast
so is it correct or no
oops
you never know whether you've got these things on right or not
hmm
you never know whether they're on right or not
yeah
yeah
well so we hope
feels wrong
okay so i don't need that
okay
okay
so david came in to me and to say uh i something we'd been talking about for a while was some stuff i'd been working on about using these topic models with uh with networks
mm-hmm
mm-hmm
with n things with links between them documents that are linked
uh n uh it's actually it's related to rapple
the rapple also
no
but it's not actually that th this is something i haven't actually been working on for a couple of months now
uh just because i came up with something more interesting that i've been working on
okay
but uh th at the time basically i'd been trying to use p. l. s. a. and those types of models on web pages
and that came up with uh a big problem in that most web pages have very very little text on them
mm-hmm
but you can tell what they're about based on the other texts on the site
the texts on the things they're linked to so what i wanted to know was can you combine the topic models that the pages
that have lots of text on them
with something else that that tells you what a page that has no or very little text on it based on the links yeah
mm-hmm
with the link here in
so quite simply if you have a page one which is like a home page
and that'll maybe have five links and a picture on it and then because it links to page two and page three
can you tell what this is about
yeah
mm-hmm
yeah so i started looking at uh google page rank which kinda does this by saying well
the links go the other way it says if this page is about fish or in google
they say if this page is good in some way and it links to this other page
and we don't know what this is then that page is more likely to be good
and it's just page rank is just a simple algorithm for doing this over the whole big network
so i wanted to combine the topic models that tell you beforehand what you think this page and this page are about with this to maybe get a better idea
mm-hmm
so the idea is say you've got some text on a page
that's only part of the picture about what of what the page is really about and the links pointing to that page are also part of the picture
so i basically came up with an algorithm that's just a i it plugs p. l. s. a. uh plugs page rank into p. l. s. a.
right so page rank you basically just d uh say
you basically take the how good this page is which is x. and how good this page is which is y.
and you then say this page is based on uh how do you do this
based on the the links coming into it uh it's just a like a sum over all the the links of uh well x. link i guess
mm-hmm
of the value yeah mm-hmm
o of of the value
mm of the previous r uh page rank or of the
uh uh the but it's not it's
yeah
if if so if this is page rank of x. page rank of y.
okay
i think this is roughly it off hand
page rank of z.
so you say page rank of z. is equal to uh one over a constant to normalise it
mm-hmm
uh sum over all the links into z. of page rank
mm-hmm
of the link
yeah tha it's like that yeah
so similar idea
if you got a vector that says what the topics are say you've learned from p. l. s. a. a d a distribution of topics for every page
so if you say a probability of topic one for uh for page uh z.
mm-hmm
uh is equal to and you can use the same sort of thing
right so nicking a whole bunch of maths from how you work out page rank uh it comes up with uh just uh an iterative algorithm
which is just uh the current probability of topic one given z. so that's probability old plus uh
okay
i yeah plus that and then you normalise between them so you say alpha and one minus alpha
yeah
okay
so w basically what you're saying here one minus alpha say link contribution you can call this i guess
so what you're saying is that a page is partly from its text that you've got on the page and it's partly from what the links say it's about
so that alpha thing is how much do you trust the text on the page and how much do you trust the links
uh-huh
so that alpha could be different for every page
mm
so what i did then was try this on a big database of web pages
okay
uh and i had some results from that but they were all on temp two so that's not important right now
uh but as it is not really important i can regenerate that
mm-hmm
the problem was that this gives you a new vector of topics for every page
so you've got two vectors you've got the one that you've just got from p. l. s. a. or whatever model and you've got the one that you get from this
uh how do you tell which one's better
i had no way to evaluate this well
how do you tell that this page because you don't know where the topics are 'cause they're learned automatically uh so
mm uh-huh
yeah
so wait uh i don't get it
you you have two representation one which comes from this link uh stuff and one f this one is not based on p. l. s. a. too
it it is yeah because uh b yeah you initialise it with uh actually thi this is kinda wrong
yeah
it is the initialisation of
okay
y
this is not old but start this is how you this is how you you start it off
a t. yeah uh okay
yeah
but then it is iterative
so this this is what p. l. s. a. gives you to start with and then you iterate this and it becomes something else
yeah
yeah okay okay
okay
okay
so you you should first train the p. l. s. a. stuff then you initialise this link uh spreading thing and then you iterate over okay
yeah
mm-hmm
that's it exactly yeah
and it converge and so you have the boost uh initial p. l. s. a. and p. l. s. a. plus the link thing then
exactly yeah so you've now got you've got p. l. s. a. gives you two probabilities right
so it gives you a probability of a topic given a document which is z. given d. and a probability of a word given a topic
yeah
mm-hmm
mm
so this is the same for both models
yeah
yeah
oh this is is frozen frozen okay
well yeah what you do is you're taking this and iterating over it the probability of the topic given the document
mm-hmm
ah uh okay
uh so have i made that clear i'm i'm not sure if i'm explaining this well
yeah yeah it's okay
yeah
okay
right so y i you m
so th yeah you you you were saying that you would like to evaluate that now
yeah so we were struggling at how do you evaluate this
yeah right
because uh i mean if you look at the way that p. l. s. a. and all those kind of models have been evaluated
it's th they never quantitative quantitatively do anything
they always say uh well look at the clustering there's here we've got some documents that all appear to be about the same thing
perplexity uh
mm mm mm
and here's where we get some other documents that all appear to be about the same thing
and you can't really tell exactly how good that is you can just get an idea that it's
yeah
or they use the perplexity on the the likelihood to say oh good this likelihood is uh is it's smaller than the other
yeah
yeah so tha that's the first thing th that thing when i spoke to you about this
mm
you suggested d use the likelihood and pedro came up with a really good example why that could be bad
mm-hmm
so you have uh
you have the uh oh let me thing of what this was
it was to do with cars basically if you have you have a topic that's uh representing
cars and you can tell that that's representing cars by looking at this distribution and it's the same for both
mm-hmm
now you wanna tell which i i this page uh pedro's example of what it was is that is says on the page lotus elise
okay
and that uh no f i can't i just remember it was a really can you ig remember what it was
oh no re no i don't even remember the the you said i would tell you that evaluation should be done based on likelihood or perplexity
no okay
yeah i didn't really consider doing it on perplexity actually that to be hon but okay
well it's bu yeah it's basically the same but
uh it's the same
hmm
but but maybe you you could have some some other labelli li or the task like if if you imagine you have some labelling on of of the web pages like like like for example you you look at at at at at a set of pages
i dunno
yeah another task or
and you have the m the directory entries of these pages so so f like yahoo or entries
okay
so you have categories and and entries so for example you have i dunno cars s. u. v. etcetera
so what you would like would be that two pages on in the same um category should be closer than than two pages being spread across different categories
is that fair though because i think one of the things with these topic models is that you don't know you can't make them cluster
but you you would not use this you will not use the yahoo directory or n the directory in the training step of i of the model okay
yeah
okay
this is something you have just for evaluation
and then for example you you your task would be to say i have some page and and i know where it is in the in the in the directory
and i have another page i don't know where it is
and i would like to to know uh whether it is in the same category as the first one
just by comparing their uh aspects
i it's making the assumption that uh this human categorisation is related to the one that is discovered uh mm
hmm
yeah
if they have the same uh yeah
mm
so basically what you would like to check if is is is there some similarity in the in the in the aspect distribution
tells me uh something about uh the sim the the fact that they could be on the same category in the the this end end label categories
mm-hmm
yeah
okay
and that is is that really fair though
can you say that if a set of documents if the clustering of these documents is closer to the effecti what you what you've got there is uh a clustering of documents a as your devaluation
yeah
oh yeah
yeah
yeah
uh thi this these labels the yahoo categories that's that's a clustering
yeah yeah
yeah
so you're by saying that this clustering is closer to that clustering is is does that necessarily mean that it's better
no but
no no no i no no no no it's doesn't have to be that if if you use the latent representations or distribution over aspects
no no no no no
how would
mm-hmm
you could use this to save two documents uh in the same directory or not
and this you should be able to evaluate then
so so so w what what you would have have basically would be to have a directory which give you labels for some part of the documents
okay
um
mm-hmm
okay so this is a directory and this is some some some some web page okay
so the labelled one okay
and you have some page which are unlabelled but you have links between those two
so what what you would do is that you would try and p. l. s. a. and and uh and use a model over that
then then you would like to for example what f what could be very simple would be just to then to match each pages like that
so let's say you have you have a a page which is labelled and you say okay
mm-hmm
the the label page two should get should be the one w which it is the most similar to or any kind of classification rules you can imagine
and so and so you say okay
what what's if i from from this page which have the similar so so the the criterion would be to compare those two distribution
okay and then and then you would like to assign to this document too where you don't know the labels the same one as this one
and and here that you use only for test so this is your
then you can evaluate how wrong you are or cu how close you are from the real assignment the right directory category
but i have the feeling i in
mm kay
in this way i think it's fair if you kn if you know only if you know only that and that and what you would like to discover is this
this is a r like a real task
mm
like like if if if this directory uh uh company would like to extend this directory to new pages without the hassle of having human labelling
but in this case you you have to use uh the label one yeah
yeah you have t you use this one
your los
you you only have the labels for some uh small part of the
but how does it enter in that
we uh i think your point was that you you train this without labelling first yeah
so
i i you have to train your uh
so you you would train it you this is this is t t all all those links are known
your training data
the links between some labelled document and unlabelled document
yeah but the point is that you should change in a way that to take the label into account or not
i d i think you can do it as a two step process
okay
first you you train uh well maybe s it wou could be better if if if you take it into account
but but maybe you can you can do just a two step process first one you have this uh unsupervised task over both p. l. and p. u.
okay okay
and then you from these unsupervised starts you can know which document of p. l. is close from the document of p. u. or the reverse
yeah
and you can infer some label to a document of p. l.
mm
clearly wha we we had done these
you can train after that uh an s. v. m. saying this is category one or two on the label document
mm-hmm
and then we will have an unlabelled document and you just say this is directory one or two
and if it should improve it if you say this feature extraction process is better than you can have a better cleaner separation between those two
well th yeah
the the thing that worries me about this approach is that say the really really really simple example of this where your directory had two categories in it
mm-hmm
uh good and bad
yeah
yeah yeah
and and and you run p. l. s. a. on it now that doesn't do it good and bad it does i dunno english and french pages
mm mm
so they don't match but the clustering is still very good in in one respect
uh but but you you can extend that up even if you have a hundred categories
yeah well but
p. l. s. a. can find a hundred clusters that are a good clustering but are completely unrelated to the directory
yeah well but i mean if you have to judge it's with respect to a given task
i mean you can't say of course it's always good because it's maximising the likelihood of whatever
hmm
no but w
but but what i wanna know i is that which of them has the better representation of a given page
yeah but
so so given a random page uh and these two models uh and the wo the words that these two models give which is more likely to
yeah
yeah
yeah
but but here you can you you say given a random page of p. u. which of those two model is more likely to to to to to say for example that thi the page of p. l. which is the most similar
mm-hmm
so you so so from this so you take any distribution comparison things
so so hoffmann in his paper was doing just cosine similarity but you can do anything
mm
so so you just compare uh those two distributions so of d. one and d. two okay
mm-hmm
and so with that you can you can determine for example for a document o of the set two to the most similar
so you you you you select d. one so in this set which is the most similar to d. two according to the distribution from one or the other model
mm-hmm
and then and then for this document you automatically assign to it the label of the document uh one
and you check with this which is your uh your your if you are right or not
mm
this is what what this is very related to what frank did with the with the keyword uh image annotation
okay
yeah it's the same
so you would have a set of keywords the set of image label with keywords and he has a set of unlabelled image with some
mm-hmm
and it would check whether the the label he assigns so in this case annotation word h are correct
and i think it's fair uh it's fair uh setup
yeah
okay
fus
so maybe this classification rule is not the best
there there's some might be some work to do but the general idea i think it's it's fair evaluations it's a task
s okay
i'm i'm just n concerned that that's uh that that's it's answering a question that evaluates in some way but maybe not in the way that
that can be dep
well that maybe not is the same way i was thinking
but maybe it's a better way um so what i mean by that is that sorry i'm trying to process all this
yeah
uh
yeah i it's the same thing like it it does tell you whether this uh which clustering is better for this task
yeah
mm-hmm
but it doesn't tell you which clustering better represents the pages necessarily
no but according to this directory yeah
but i
but it it's it you you could say that it possibly doe it probably does
yeah
'cause i don't think there is any way to say generally this this is better or worse
no
yeah
okay
the the there is not uh v uh perfect uh clustering clus wh what is the how do you judge uh what is a good clustering
i i i think it's w
yeah
yeah
it has to be re it has to be really to with respect to this this clustering makes sense or i dunno
yeah
yeah
what's good with the directory is that you have a good coverage of various topic humans humans can label
mm
but then if you want to detect different languages this is another task
i think the task of this latent model is to discover some some semantic like some topic proximity between documents
and here this la this directory is doing the same thing like associating some topics with some documents manually
so comparing them is is is is good setup with respect to the goal
yeah i
and you're not exactly compar uh
you're comparing them
i compare those two like the p. l. s. a. and the one over this same task of assigning good directory
ah okay okay
yeah yeah
yeah
i don't know if if it if it will provide good result result or not but it is clearly a benchmark for those two goals
yeah
you can e even keep the bag of words and do the cosine comparison or
also like a baseline yeah
on on the infra yeah yeah
mm
just showing just showing how just first how better this is with respect to bag of words and hopefully then how you new uh regularised p. l. z. given d. is
yeah
like bag o yeah
yeah you can have tree setups uh yeah
i dunno just uh yeah it's basic
okay
yeah basic cosine over the p. of t. given d. so over all this uh empirical distribution
mm-hmm
and the two uh aspect uh models
but
mm
i think mm
you m you still not combi
we have to repeat over and over
uh no i th i'm i'm coming round to it actually
yeah
no i'm so i i i think i g uh i i get it
this is like advertisement
no no but it's another
no no it's joke
uh i i th i think it probably is fair i'm just i i've gotten um uncomfortable with it
but i think that'll go if i think about it enough
no it's jus
uh but but yeah the it it but it just seems a little suspect
yeah
but i think that's just from the whole point that you can't tell which clustering is b better
mm
yeah yeah
yeah just know where
but uh what i'd thought before was could you get people to evaluate this by by hand basically
this is really yeah yeah
could you give people a set of pages and like say you did it with five topics for example
yeah
uh now you give people five sheets uh you give uh a t a a user five sheets of paper each with
words in varying sizes representing the probability of that topic for example
yeah
try give the user these pieces of paper to get an idea of what these topics are that's this p. of w. given z.
mm-hmm
yeah
and then you give them some pages and say which one would you which piece of paper would you put that with
yeah
and then you get like an intuitive ide uh like how would a person cluster pages given the what these topics supposedly are
mm
yeah
'cause i you've got something that's fixed the the p. of w. given z. with respect to both models
yeah
so i was tr i was hoping you could use that to
but the point is that the z. the the the aspect like the z. are are are come unsupervisely
it's it's more like if you were giving the people you you said to them okay
uh divide me this bunch of documents into five topics and you don't give them the topics a priori you know
so the two person could come up with very different one is very interesting i in
mm mm
mm
in fact i i have seen a paper in i. c. m. l. where the guy was trying to learn which word he um aspects of clustering
so i give you i give the real users mm the person um a bunch of marbles and they begin to say okay
mm-hmm
mm-hmm
and they have to divide it in five group and in the end it's not al it's it's always different to the clustering each people has
because it's completely subjective
yeah okay
but in but there is uh some characteristic that are for transparency colour
which are um features that made the clustering that can be extracted even if the clustering it's always different
yeah
right
mm-hmm
hmm
yeah
okay
so i i think i think it's yeah
so so that's only to say that uh it's it can be really infinitive clustering
see
the the thing about web pages i thought as well in that getting humans to evaluate it in some way is that you have most of the web pages that are uh well a lot of the web pages that are important in some way are are are home pages
so google dot com doesn't actually say the words search on it i think
i maybe it says go but you only know it's about search through the thing but someone looking at it can tell that it's a search engine
mm-hmm
because of the way it's laid out because of the pictures on it and because of all of that
yeah
there's a lot of information that's completely lost in this bag of words representation and i was hoping that in some way you could use that to evaluate this
yeah
i have no idea how but uh yeah
say another another example apart from uh this uh search
uh i don't get it exactly
mm
what you mean then don't don't use a google page because it's uh too uh s root but uh another page mm
but eve ev even someone would would provide very different labels like like someone would say it's a page in english
someone would say it's a it's a it's a it's a it's a web page uh wh which has very few uh information in it or anything
so i think there's no hard clustering
and what's good with those model is that they they can they they are intended to provide you some some kind of way to compare two documents rather than to give you pre defined sets of documents
yeah
this is not hard clustering
the o i i don't think one one one aspect or one latent topic has any sense by his own
yeah yeah
it's when you have the word set and the word distribution that you c you can tell something
if you just take one of them alone
so you take all the p. of z. given d. and all of the p. of w. given giv given z. you you you can do anything with that
it's it's the whole set
i would say an an and this is oh it it should be evaluated
meaning that like for example uh the the example about marbles is that the point what you can learn from all these sets made by people is that is that those two those two marble would be consider as more likely to be in the same sets
mm
because they they share some common properties which are not seen as the same for every one
mm
but they share some common properties that people will notice
and if you look at the two the d all possible pairs of marble
yeah
you would have some mu much more agreement between people than than if you look at the predefined sets people would would just cut at some precise uh point
you know what's
okay i think i know it
but it yeah thi this is effectively what we have here though and th that directory is one clustering of the marbles
yeah
mm-hmm
and you're hoping that it it so what you're saying is that i have two clusterings of marbles for my two models
yeah
and i have a test clustering of marbles
it's saying that one of these is more close to the test t t to the the one that we've been given
well you don't you don't really have two clustering no no no no you don't you don't really have two clustering
no it does
is that it's saying that what does that actually say
oh it's not that
that doesn't uh it says it's g better for this task but it doesn't really say anything else
yeah
no no no no you don't have two clustering of of of marbles
it doesn't have to match
what you have is y is you have is you have one clustering of marble which is this one
mm-hmm
and then you have lots of people telling you i consider those marbles as very uh have to have very salient feature that they share in common
i i c i would like them to be in the same cluster
and you c and and and those two so and one of them is labelled and the other is not labelled
okay
so you look at that you say oh someone told this one was very similar
and this one is said to be blue for example i dunno if it's the label
so i put it in the blue bag
okay
but but you don't you never use the blue bag you don't ask the people to look at the blue bag
you just look at the people you you just have the people to compare those two marbles
and then it happens that some of them have been clustered
people being your algorithm
and and
that's the point
yeah
mm
yeah
yeah
yeah this is i reverse both role
it's getting
but yeah it just re
okay
the this is the players
uh and so and so if i get that right
what what the algorithms are still coming up with is in this way you're looking at a clustering of marbles yeah
if each of the algorithms comes up with a defin
i i no no no no no
it comes up with not with the clustering but with some way to compare two marbles okay
mm-hmm
some would say would say i consider those two ones are completely dissimilar and the other ones say they are very similar
ah okay right that makes sense
yeah
and if you find that in your unl unlabelled clustering those two uh balls uh marbles happen to be in the same uh cluster
you said the user algorithm might be wrong
but you average that over lots of documents
okay
because the the latent aspects really doesn't have to match the final uh directory category
mm-hmm exactly
it can be anything but it's just a way of saying yeah those documen documents are similar in some sense
so
we're not trying to to fit yeah
okay
is it just it just sometime dangerous to say th these latent aspects means this
okay
yeah i think yeah
i'm convinced i'm convinced alright
good good good
so it's good
right
uh alright well thanks
um i'm trying to think of anything i haven't said about the stuff but that uh from looking at the results i got it looked quite good
um just like hand reading them in that one of the things i did was i started a i a web crawl at the idiap homepage
it did not very many pages only like two thousand or something like that
but enough to get the pages that were close to idiap to have a lot of links between them
so that there was enough to be able to run this link clustering algorithm
so what you find is that the pages around idiap there's a lot of english pa speaking pages and a lot of french speaking pages
so of course this uh p. l. s. a. completely separated those out into into categories
uh so when i looked at the the word likelihoods there were two topics
one was very clearly english words that most likely word was the and one was very clearly french words most likely words was de i think and uh
mm
mm-hmm
you had onl two topics
no i had many topics
or no
yeah
the others looked like garbage couldn't tell what they might have been
but anyway uh tha that's often the case
yeah
when you look at it you can tell very clearly that one or two topics are a b not the rest yeah
yeah yeah yeah
yeah
yeah and the others usually don't mean anything yeah
yeah
yeah
it is
they make sense only so global optimisation the likelihood is optimisable globally over the whole aspects etcetera
so it's it's you never ask the model to do hard clustering of documents
you just uh ask uh it to find a distribution over aspects such that a document uh is more likely according to the restriction that the number aspe aspect is limited
and and so it the it just makes sense on the uh looking at the whole set
so y i think all evaluation should take that into account and look at the whole aspect set
ok
like here you look at the aspect set because you look at the similarity of two distribution
an any st any kind of thing you where you un unfold the model and look at it manually
mm-hmm
looks weird like like in those hoffmann papers where show you columns with words or things
mm-hmm
hmm
that w uh anyway that when i run it on that uh what i found was
looking through some of the sites uh i looked for the sites that the models differed on
that where one said it was probably an english phrase and the other said it was probably a french phrase
and i found a good few examples where you had a site that looked uh well one that i remember off hand was it was a page and it was a big picture
and links down the site but the links were all pictures
so you couldn't the the words were in french and the links but there were no words picked up by the when i did the crawl for the model
mm-hmm
and there was a small bit down here and in this there was uh meant to be picture in there
but it didn't load uh or uh b it was meant to be something else
and it said uh in english it said four o. four this page cannot be found
so all the words on this page were english but it was very very clearly a french page
mm-hmm
so the first model said it was an english page 'cause all the words were in english
second model said very definitely a french page because all of these pointed to french sites and it was only pointed to it was something dot f. r. as well
it was linki mm-hmm mm-hmm
okay
okay
it's
okay
so it was a a good point for you
yeah
for your model mm good
mm mm-hmm mm
so i i found a couple of examples that were kinda like that
like this yeah mm mm mm okay
mm but the the problem that i found when i ran it
uh the th the thing that was a bad point was that if you have uh say tryin i was trying to say if you could evaluate this with search given some keywords like which model would more likely find you a p good document
that that sort of approach
uh what i found was that say you had uh
uh th tha that's not too relevant necessarily but if you have say a topic distribution for uh one page
and it very very highly scores on the p. l. s. a. for one of the the topics
and that's right okay this model because it's averaging out over all the pages nearby all of the topic distributions become more flat
mm-hmm
mm
mm mm
it it becomes more uncertain about everything
okay
so i don't know if that's necessarily a good thing or not yeah
mm mm probably not yeah
yeah
in in some cases it's gonna be a bad thing b because ev every page is linked by the way the algorithm works
mm mm
yeah
every page is linked eventually to everything else so it every page has information incorporated in it
mm mm
or i the distribution learned for every page has information incorporated in it from every other page's distribution as well
so it averages out it flattens all the distributions depending on what this alpha is
yeah
mm
yeah
yeah mm
but also it depends on that could be a good effect
and
because if you if you can be if you can if you are uh highly reliable about one page
but all the page linking to it are actually about very different topics
mm-hmm
so you could say maybe i was wrong from deciding only due to the text that this page was about this aspect distribution
because because all the other pages are voting in different direction
well i i think that the thing is
while there's a balance
yeah that that there's a balance in the uh for example take a page like uh slashdot
and it's like a news site uh for geeks and you have uh nerds yeah
nerd
mm-hmm
nerd
news for nerds stuff that matters
yeah
uh all of the like hundreds of thousands of pages point to that but they're about completely different things
so you in effect are losing information about what that page is about because there's so many things pointing to it and they all average out as
hmm
yeah
um this alpha i can it be dependent of the of the document
yeah so that
and how many text is in it
or something uh yeah
th that's my first idea w was how i set this i remember for the lotus thing wasn't there
mm
mm
um so i thought you wanna probably set this alpha per page there's probably some heuristics
for example this page there's no text in it will set it very low in user information for the links
mm-hmm so mm
problem is this is what pedro immediately said what if you have a page that looks like this
it's got a big picture of a car uh
mm-hmm
pedro's always speaks about cars
yeah cars and web
anyway and it says lotus elise so you know that it's definitely about car but it's only got two words
mm-hmm
so you can't just do it by words because those two words completely specify into something or other
uh su you suggested doing likelihood but at that time and i can't remember what my problem was with that
it might not have been a good thing but you've got two likelihoods for it as well
but i think for any kind of way you have to select those alpha you you have to look at the effect on on the re on the t evaluation task
no maybe not
mm
and then maybe you can find some patterns that are then then once you have the once you have the task
yeah maybe do it by cross validation something
you could look at at which pages are completely missed by one model
which others are are successful with one model and and you can maybe infer some some rules afterwards
but if you have no task you can uh blindly select s good alphas
okay there's
like like if if you look at uh if you look at your task and you see that i dunno uh
oh of course
yeah mm
mm
the the long pages for example have good p. l. s. a. model without fusing links
so then you can infer some heuristics like okay the alpha should be proportional to the lengths or anything like that
mm
or to the number of image in the pages or anything
hmm
but you should have some some task where you can individually look at the performance on every on every page
yeah yeah w w i think we've agree on that yeah
yeah that that is fair
mm mm
and and and and at as a second step you could infer some kind of rule about how to select alphas with respect to the task
yeah okay
maybe it's v it's very simple rules but select them blindly s might be odd
it yeah d
no
yeah i so uh i i think that that's too easy
you can do it with some heuristics and you can learn it from the task results in or combine the two so tha that's kinda straightforward i think
yeah
mm
mm probably heuristic it will be easier to compute because
yeah
the the the thing about doing it through cross validation or something like that with the task is uh the problem with doing a page rank style algorithm is that is that it gets better it it converges better and it gives you better results
yeah
the closer a network is to being a small world network
mm-hmm
mm-hmm
so small world network mean basically some far links but generally very clustered locally
mm-hmm yeah mm
yeah
uh now the thing about doing a web crawl is the bigger your web crawl
the closer it'll be to the overall structure of the net n the internet which is a small world network
the smaller your web crawl the less small world network like it's gonna be
mm
mm-hmm
yeah
so the more pages you get the better your results
and people running this style of algorithm the page rank style stuff generally run it on about two million or twenty million pages or whatever
the the stanford web base data set that i was using for this for for a bit of this um
yeah
they have a a d i can't remember off hand
but they have m maybe a bit over a theta byte worth of web pages in this a bunch of servers
mm
but but but still li like the the the work i did on on hyperlinks like i used uh wikipedia
uh
yeah maybe wikipedia is a good thing to do
i i think it's g because it has fairly high level of inside links between
was i was concerned about wikipedia though was that it's while it has a high level of inside links that has a lot of directory style links as well that might mess up it actually being a see wh while you have
yeah
well you can categorise them because they are th it's there's a structure on the on the web page
so you you can select only the links which are within the article or within the categories or it's it's it's well structured it's it's uh easy to manipulate and
ah okay that's good
that plus i guess it's actually straightforward to say to start with is this a small world network and then run it on that
yeah
you can even isolate the directory from the categories of wikipedia
you were running that on what we what was it like half a million pages something like that
well yeah actually i i i divided in three equal size parts which have one hundred fifty documents
is it and that was for half of it
uh if i remember
okay
okay the whole thing was
there are a thousand documents
and well but
did you manage to to divide the link uh properly or
well what i did with the link well but this is not th exactly the same setup you would have
okay
so in this setup the whole link structure could be known
and the only thing you wou don't you w don't know would be the assignation to uh to a category
mm-hmm
in my setup it was different because i i sh i couldn't use the links between different sets
mm
but this is not i don't want to mess you up with that it's not the same kind of experiment
but you could just use the whole corpus like this and and for some of them you assume you don't know the the category assignment
mm-hmm
and then you can run this set of experiments over wikipedia
okay
i mean i think off hand thinking about this model it would have to work better because two things in the same category are going to be linked
yeah
so it it yeah
but this is the yeah this is the hypothesis between this uh in this p. l. s. a. with link stuff
okay
oh yeah i thi
yeah that's i think tha it's gonna be more true in some networks and in some tasks than others
and i think in the wikipedia it's probably gonna be it's a good one to test on
yeah
but you can you can think also at at other uh task like that
like for example you can take proceedings and assume the categories are the keywords of the of the d of the documents
and then if you have the archive of a journal you can you can use the l the links between uh the citation links
mm-hmm
so if you want to have a bigger stuff so wikipedia would be kind of very small with lots of engli in links
okay
and then if you take a journal you will have less links and and more documents
and then you would be likely to say that p. l. s. a. might be better over that because you don't have enough links
so you you you can find examples which are not the web i think it's good to work in closed set
okay
wikipedia is kind of closed set ma even if there's lots of outside links but there's lots of inside links
you have to think at at at at at at at database where there's lot of in links
hmm
wikipedia might be one citation for example if if you take the nips arch archive which is available
nips author always other nips author which are often themselves etcetera
well it's reported i i won't say
so but but but but yeah i think th th this kind of setup maybe web pages it's hard to find
sets of web pages which have good links stuff if you start from one page or something
mm-hmm
okay
yeah it i'll maybe i'll have a look at the wikipedia stuff anyway
i'm stuck doing something else for the next month or two anyway so
uh this is always the case
okay
uh the there's another thing um uh this was new but i haven't thought about this too much
but it's on the same lines in that uh have have you guys seen this uh correlated topic models work
which ones uh
correlated topic models
it's david blei the guy that came up with uh with l. d. a.
no no
l. d. a.
he's got uh a new model that's it's published in nips this year but his co author put it on their web site a month or two ago
so uh you know l. d. a.
d you all know l. d. a. or yeah
mm-hmm
uh okay
so a l. d. a. you basically draw a a dirichlet which says like what type of document this is effectively
and then you draw a topic given that dirichlet distribution and then you draw words given that
alright well that's for for every word and that's once for the document and that's you've got a parameter coming at this globally
so that that's roughly what the model is plus other little bits
but anyway so what they did was they they reworked this because one of the problems with l. d. a.
and i think p. l. s. a. has this problem as well in is that uh the more topics you have
the less uh expressive it can be
because the topics it cluster it it pushes a document if it is pulling a document into one topic it pushes another topic away from that
mm-hmm
doesn't that make sense
so the topics are necessarily trying to be different from each other
so the more topics you have the more th they're sort of squeezing into the space of what things can be about uh and things are kinda pushed out
so once you m go over you try it one corpus
and once you go over about a hundred maybe two hundred topics
uh the the new you add more topics and it doesn't get better in any way the model doesn't
mm-hmm
the n new topics are effectively going to just be garbage
uh alright so what they did was they they they stopped using the dirichlet and uh they're starting to use uh a gaussian there
so it it in to spare the details basically they've they've got a variable here
hmm
i think they call it eta uh and they from this generate a distribution of topics in some way
but it's generated from a gaussian space from a from a a space so it's given a a mean and covariance uh and
but it's discrete uh no the
yeah uh so what it does the this is the the bit that took me forever to understand actually uh same model
but this is given a gaussian space it maps that down into the simplex of what a topic can be about
the so the simplex basically if you've got a say you've got two topics
now say i i say you get three topics that makes more easier to draw
uh for this is theta one theta two theta three
mm-hmm
these are the probabilities that that a document is about uh this theta one is the probability that this document is about topic one
theta two is so these guys all have to add up to one yeah
mm-hmm
uh so that basically means that what a document is about lies on this space between them yeah
mm pyramid yeah
so this is the simplex
uh so basically a distribution generated by this guy is basically a point on this simplex
so what they do is they've got a distribution that maps uh a gaussian and some space into a distribution on this thing
so it maps it into gaussian in that
okay
the cool thing about that is that if you've got two gaussians you can tell how close they are
so you can now tell how close two topic distributions are right
ah okay
so you can have as many as you like uh and you can tell that they're close to each other
so there's load of ideas that i had about this uh in that if you can tell that two topic distributions are close to each other
so for example if you split a document into two parts and said that the two parts have to be close in the distribution
you can see how the doc t the document changes for exa stu stuff based on that
with this idea what if rather than working with this p. of z. given d. thing that you had from p. l. s. a.
but what if you worked from these gaussians that you get for every document and you said that in some some function that said uh that the gaussian representing this should be similar to the ones linking to it
now i haven't thought about any of the maths for this
but but it should be uh straightforward i guess to to formulate a basic in terms of the mean should be similar and the covariance maybe should be similar as well
so it might actually be a better model again
yeah
i dunno
okay
yeah
i'll send you guys the link for that correlated topic model stuff if you want but uh i don't know if it's too interesting to you
yeah
mm mm
'kay yeah thanks
okay
'kay
alright well than thanks for hearing me out and the idea especially
mm mm
okay yeah
maybe i can do more with this
well in in three months
in two months yeah
alright
yeah
well there are lots of good ideas that are recorded and someone will
oh yeah it's too late three months
we should wait
yeah
yeah b
because the data like will be released very soon
bastien you can't release this data for four months
so yeah we put this stuff on so that so that we have some record of the whole thing what uh are going to say
and uh the whole idea here is says also put the lapel on
yep
uh the whole idea of this meeting is that it's not me who will be talking all the time
so so that would be a boring that would be definitely boring meeting
oh what what is the topic here
s so joel is going to talk
no i'm going to listen
yeah yeah yeah
so i so the p the actually the reason why we got together is that it's ab it's about the time to a. make sure that when petr leaves us uh i'm afraid it may happen
right
i mean it or did you didn't change your mind yet
well i guess so
that's mine
i couldn't
or your girlfriend didn't change your mind
i would like to change
but i cannot
so so that whatever he's whatever he's been doing uh is not uh forgotten and then people can stay on his shoulders and uh i hope that he won't get out entirely out of uh out of uh this problem
but still we we need to continue on this
yeah
so i think the joel will be is is my main hope that he's uh he's going to pick up uh the key word spotting and some of these ideas and also the reason why p uh i p uh uh petr motlicek is here is that joel is also getting interested in uh opal models of uh tem temporal envelope
yeah
yeah
that's true
yeah and of of course pet uh petr for signals
so about it but petr motlicek too
well i think that i'm more now
eh both of you you know
much more than me
well may from different point of view
so but but but you will be here and from different point of view eh
because
but
petr motlicek is working mainly on speech coding
yeah
oh
yeah
okay
speech coding
yeah and uh so so this is um yeah i guess this is it
so m i i guess that really you should be talking more than anybody else because you should be asking questions
no
yeah
yeah well that's uh yeah
yeah
right
yeah i know
so what is it that you need to know
so
and uh
let me just tell us so what you know already about uh i don't know how far you are with the s features
yeah
uh well uh so basically i started reading about the features that's taking the long temporal and uh time frame that's uh traps
or
yeah
and uh tandem approach
so you know s something like that
yeah s yeah yeah
so then i also started with the there was a paper on uh fitting a ear model to the d. c. t. of a signal
started with that and slowly getting used to the stuff
mm-hmm
to the d. c. d.
s
yeah
but t what christos was doing
oh i cannot say it
uh i think yeah yeah
to the hilbert envelope you mean no
it's uh the paper by dan ellis and co
right
oh this were ho how it started basically because that was uh marios athineos yeah and dan ellis
yeah
yeah yeah
yeah
yeah
yeah
they had a paper i believe it was not in icassp a. s. r. u. or something right
a. s. r. u.
two thousand four i guess yeah
it was a a. s. r. u. but that was a time when they weren't using very long uh uh uh d uh segments
mm-hmm
two thousand three yeah
yeah okay
yeah
it was like fifty millisecond or something what they were playing with at the time
okay
yeah yeah yeah
yeah yeah
yeah i know
so then i the story was that then uh marios presented that at so some meeting and we realised oh
so for
yeah
that might be cute thing uh for uh estimating uh spectral energies
because that's what we want
and we'll the the way we've uh we are doing it is kind of i think it works but it's little bit inelegant
somehow stupid so so first do the frame by based uh estimate
mm-hmm
mm-hmm
yeah
and then you you get stick to hundred hertz sampling ten millisecond sampling or uh something and then you just pick up the trajectory
so so marios was here for half a year maybe or even more uh and uh started work with petr who also j just came
why that
i don't think so
mm-hmm
so they were working little bit together
mainly m marios was uh programming in matlab and petr was putting it into fancy is yeah and uh but uh and but then we were hoping uh uh uh th to pick up on that little bit more
yeah i just re wrote in in c. plus plus
i didn't do us so much on that
and we we did right
you did a little bit of work
well we we tried uh many knobs to tune on th on that
yeah
because you can decide what compression factor and everything
okay
so i tried a little bit like um pick maybe three knobs and try to go through the three d. three d. cage to see what happens in which which kind of settings
mm-hmm
so this we did
hmm
but we we didn't because there was still a question that i don't remember right now
and we never published that anywhere right
huh
yeah
because there was some essential question
i i don't remember
i would have to look at it f and because be before i wou before i we could u we could write anything i i would be have to be sure that something is right there
yeah
yeah
i couldn't be sure about it at the time
yeah
so and anyway it it takes time this this computation
yeah
it's it's very inefficient
it takes like hundred times more than computing some m. f. c. c. s computing these features because it's uh huge d. c. t. huge f. f. t. everywhere
and
yeah
we were also doing a serious thing that we were stepping it by ten millisecond right
yeah
at the time
there is no optimisation
right
we just stick to the trap
yeah
we wanted to make as close to trap as is possible which is silly but that w you have to start somewhere
right
mm-hmm
that was a reasonable start yeah
yeah
yeah
so then i continued with uh another uh paper that you are mentioning l. p. trap
so i just moving around with that ideas
and also uh the main idea today why i told maybe is like if you can list down what all things are there to be taken care of
yeah
then one by one
because finally face find i do have something else
so uh maybe to list down the things other than the what i've already taken from you
y okay
and also to discuss generally
so so what well last time we we were s talking about what about gaussians
you you have the gaussians running somehow
yeah
like feature extraction
yeah
feature extraction
and then the tandem training c also so the you are able to train the net now
part tandem training
so you may be the only one in the whole world now
because uh because chi fong is gone and uh and uh barry is gone
no
no so they are going from icsi
so morgan was joking no what he informed me they are gone from icsi
uh chi fong went to t. i. and uh and uh uh uh b barry is at lawrence livermore lab
huh
he basically got a job
he he graduated
and he's he'll be working on things which he cannot talk about
yeah
he can't even say it on a microphone here i heard
eh
it's uh i yeah it's classified work typically
it's and so so jo morgan was h only half joking
he was s somebody was asking him you were or so s or somebody was asking him something
uh or there was uh there was uh matthew and he said well probably we'll be coming to ask you because nobody really knows anymore at icsi
so please stay
'kay
but who who is the one who who is now developing the quicknet and these things
the the m. l. p. four and these things
uh th nobody
because it's
that was barry
and now it's uh cl close histo actually brno is doing a a lot of that now
it was barry
they picked up the software and they play with the and nets
yeah
ah i see
so that might be that brno will be at the soonest as uh a ultimate expert on on the whole thing
i see
well still we have the experts who who made the software on here you know
olivier bornet and
n n where which software
no they ne quicknet was done uh uh well quicknet itself was done actually long time ago at icsi
uh quicknet training
yeah
yes but olivier make it run on on these machines and make the uh cross the two g. barrier here at idiap
is that so
group
because we couldn't we couldn't do something i don't know what
but he is he is no good in quicknet right i s i guess
what yeah yeah
okay
so we h have to treat him well
yeah
um okay
so yeah right now i have the feature extraction part where i can get the phoneme posteriors and through the neural net
so so
right
so then i think i need yeah
so you just miss the back end which is easy because it's h. t. k. it's everyone knows here
yeah i yeah but uh yeah it's t. k. through for some other task i've run it's t. k.
so i have the general feel
okay
but uh maybe i can take the interceptor from you and run it once on my to have it
yeah okay
a and you you just need from us to hear w what are the other p front ends and other features to to choose or something
yeah
so
yeah
basically
so then i can can share what i ca have read and uh
well the whole idea then is that then you start playing with it right
yeah
and you yeah and
yes
okay so how do we do it
shou shou should i list it
so i'll use this
or
maybe that might be the
yeah the
let's do the feature extraction that we have already taken then the back end for that
yeah
then
well uh like i i d i distinguish between feature extraction and then the m. l. p.
yeah
because see you feed something to the m. l. p. which are not the waves
yeah
okay
so so well and that's that's what i call it
uh so yeah
and then the back end
yeah
but okay
well so what what i have here what i've been working on since i was here was m. f. c. c. p. l. p. which is always needed for compressing purposes
yeah
then traps with w various lengths
and also uh you know traps now
yeah
traps i know
but though with various
with var various lengths we were trying to to start them from from on the ultimate length of one one uh frame up to one second or even more
okay
length
ah
okay
on frame
frame
oh
but it was mm so this
also w then we apply the d. c. t. on the trap itself which is some something like the gaussians
okay
applying some filt filtering
filtering yeah
basically the trap
so this
but this is mainly franta who was doing this
mm-hmm
so this is related to traps
i was also trying the warping
okay
means if you have a second um which is uh a hundred and one samples i was just keeping the central ten ten samples
yeah
and then i was throwing away some some of them you know
like with sampling this this uh one second of the trap to something which i which i uh preserved all the points in the centre and just uh picked every tenth point at the boundaries
mm-hmm
mm-hmm
which means the trap uh hundred and one trap trajectory shrank to say fifteen points with uh with still preserving the maximum resolution at the centre and throwing away most of the points near the boundary
okay
so this i was trying
so these i have some results on
so these are traps
then the gauss traps
okay
then tandem system
okay
uh the tandem you plus minus half
because that's that's just a p. l. p. s
okay
and then there is a training uh with m. l. p. that's taking some context of these p. l. p. coefficients
okay
uh-huh
so it's like feeding the p. l. uh p. l. p. s or m. f. c. s w whatever to m. l. p. and taking some context
mm-hmm
this is the tandem
so this set up we also have here
okay
i didn't experiment with this
but maybe you some more results oh it's hemant who has the results on tandem i guess no
okay
he used to have before he lost all the data
yeah yeah
we shouldn't smile
it's alright
right
yeah
but uh i think the uh i think the most important results are already in the thesis he's writing
but he will have it again
yeah
so so is there some somewhere
so this is tandem
uh then uh then what
and then there is the f. d. l. p.
then we can talk more about
yeah
yeah that's ri
which is which i have more experiments on
yeah
also this warping and compressions and all these things
right
so compression basically you are looking at i guess yeah
so
yeah
yeah but i'm using that for different different reason right
so it's uh speech coding
mm-hmm
so uh what is the task is usual just take the speech of course somehow to encode it into as as small number of beat as possible and with a reasonable quality of course
coding
yeah
and again to e uh decode it
okay
and i'm using f. d. l. p. for that still playing with uh more less one second long segments
uh-huh
uh-huh
so just dividing the speech into one s one second frames doing d. c. t.
okay
uh-huh
it's just the standard wor of work
and then doing some compression and computation of yeah yeah yeah sh oh yeah
well it's bil still sub bands no
but you are doing the same no
well yeah
yeah b yeah yeah you take the the d. c. t. and you just divide it into several sub bands frequency bands with a different uh
but that you just didn't talk about any sub band so far
okay
mm-hmm
and by the way you don't do the overlap on the sub bands no
no that's for compression
i d i do
or you do
yeah but you don't do the overlap on the time domain
you mean
you said somethi yeah
no no no
no
i don't do
okay so that's the difference
i don't need for for compression you basically don't need the
yeah just one second with without overlapping
but in frequency domain there is a overlap
because you can choose which filters you want more less or just trajectories of those bands
yeah
so there is overlapping
i'm using those gaussian filters or classical those those trapet trapezoidal like in uh m. f. c. c. s right
hmm
mm-hmm
mm-hmm
and p. l. p.
and then processing each f yeah p. l. p. s
p. l. p. s
m. f. c. c. or triangles
triangle
uh yeah
okay tr triangulars
that one
then i'm doing s doing uh independent processing of each frequency band
okay
mm-hmm
so i'm computing that hilbert envelope which is just the envelope of some temporal trajectory
okay
the speech signal yeah
and more or less you can divide this into a hilbert envelope hilb hilbert carrier
we use something like l. p. a linear prediction envelope
mm-hmm
auto regressive model and excitation signal
mm-hmm
yeah so those are two parts or items you need somehow to encode if you want again to get original speech or reasonable quality
okay
mm-hmm
mm-hmm
and yeah there is some compression factor which is again when you're computing that auto regressive model from f. d. l. p.
mm-hmm
you can compress the spectrum somehow in in such a way that you rather um preserve those even also those dips not only peaks in the spectrum
mm-hmm
okay
and it sounds better for some kind of speech signals
mm-hmm
so you know about this compression how how does it why it's okay
yeah yeah
yeah
knows more than than than i do
i just don't know
ah he's new
he's he's doing you most of the things
so it's kind of logarithm when you use logarithm for m. f. c. c. s right
s so that's good
yeah
so it's again compression factor something like th and but then you have to uncompress it again of course to get back the speech
mm-hmm
and there other other things which i'm doing
mm-hmm
so
but it's not related to speech recognition so much or but
okay
but certainly when it comes to like uh the the opal modelling of temporal trajectories
even pe petr fousek is not here you probably know a lot about it by now
well what
well
no
that uh uh ap approximating hilbert envelope by opal model
right right
i what
i a v a v. l. p.
i i d yeah
uh as as i say when you when you are not here that that petr motlicek knows enough about it too
well the beginning of the
well it's yeah
sure sure i know
i mean it's more or less the same approach right
oh yeah
sure sure sure sure
because same ap yeah different uh application different uh different software or something
okay
there is m uh just more right right right
yeah
okay
yeah
so um just they in th um in the speech uh re synthesis or coding what you're doing um did you try to to play with the knobs somewhere
yeah
with what
like uh many uh uh v widths
i m no no
the compression number of bands and lengths of the so what you what you were playing with and what other result
yeah yeah
sure
number of bands and
like what to use so that it sounds the best
you know that's the problem for speech coding
because i don't have results like in speech recognition
yeah o of course you you listen to it yourself
so of course i have to listen it and and s well so now what i'm using are fifteen bands
i d i'm fine with that
because
which seems to me fit fifteen frequency band which seems to me quite reasonable
we can go down till like twelve and still okay i would say
yeah
but then you start hearing difference
or also that's another problem
okay
once you can go down with frequency bands then you will have much uh more c uh complicated data
but
uh let's say excitation signal or that carrier which yeah because broad bands right
if you go down
yeah
if if you make a b broader bands
because
because when the band is narrow the c excitation is close the carrier is close to s sinusoid basically co sinusoid
yeah maybe like that
no
so there is more and more s uh frequency components let's say or something like that in one broad band
i see
so so you won't say that the l. p. c. is not able to fit it so that the residual was easy
so
no
l. p. c. will maybe
but then you have still another part sometime something like a source and a filter
so when you are doing speech coding or
you may almost want to dis uh um i b uh uh uh yeah uh b use the white board
yeah use maybe you can use the board for that yeah
yeah
i mean uh and uh that's why we have it here right so that
will be hero
why
can we remove this when you are going to this place
i don't think so
i don't know now
i don't think so
it's quite long
no no no no
oh
i think no we are wired
are not supposed
well i mean it's it's the same like when you are doing l. p. l. p. synthesis right
so you've got source signal
i don't know
source
i think you have to push it push it as much as possible because it reacts to the
except
uh
yeah
and then there is some filter which is that one divided by a. z.
and that's and that's it
and the source can be a noise signal or it can be some uh sequence of uh what is that
pulses
periodic pulse yeah
pulses right
this is l. p.
yeah
this is a standard time domain l. p. right
this is yeah
yeah
so and it's more less or less the same what i'm doing
so this is some envelope which is in our case related to hilbert envelope
and this is a source signal which is hilbert carrier
but since you are in a different domain this is he here we are in time domain right
but this is uh
but but you are you are really in a frequency domain
right
so it uh the line's turning to into sines right
right
and you p and since this this i mean because this thi this this spectrum is al has also line spectrum right
oh which lines
exactly
yeah
so this is now going to be frequency
yeah
yeah
okay okay okay okay okay
i mean all components
mm-hmm
so if you are then if we are in a frequency th your source looks like this
yeah
so more or less if we uh can we can plot it
and
so what we can see is some hilbert envelope like this
i see what you mean
and then there is that hilbert carrier
or this not hilbert carrier
but this is the signal which we get from one di one frequency band
so you compute d. c. t. right from signal
this is the sub band time signal
yeah yeah exactly
it's uh yeah right
it's
and what we get from that is this hilbert envelope right
so you know that
and the second which should be that carrier should be something like this
yeah
i see
it's just really close to cosine we m we might see if we do it do it properly right
okay
so
and this is what you also have to somehow transmit or at least try to transmit in order to get
mm-hmm
i see
and this is where
i was thinking the residual in l. p. c. fit of the hilbert envelope not this
i was not thinking of this at all before you know
right right
'cause there are three things
first you have to encode this then the l. p. c. coefficients and the residual after l. p. c. fit if you like
right
no i don't need l. p. c.
no no
this is like a residual for him
oh you don't
this is a residual for me
yeah in the for uh frequency it is
this is the residual
yeah i'm just wan i just want to transmit this signal right
it's and what you need is this envelope and this one carrier
yeah
well i
and you again get the same signal this this this shape doing i. d. c. t.
okay
yeah
yeah
and the biggest problem currently is that the carrier is actually not cosine but uh something little bit more uh uh interesting
putting everything together
yeah right
right
but if you take a look for example for a s if you have a very g good music signal
which is very uh periodic you can really see something like there is one peak and
mm-hmm
and if the frequency doesn't change over the wa over over the lengths of the uh
and frequency more or less doesn't change
it's uh related to uh that frequency of the broad band or how it's called
yeah
yeah
that that's nice
if you add those filters which are uh wider and wider this is that centre frequency which is somehow related to this one
yeah
okay
so then you can transmit uh just fe
and so so so the so the broader bands do what on this picture
l left left
it's worse and worse
don't then you don't see any anything like cosine
but but f f fortunately because of he uh because of properties of hearing more or less
but
for the higher bands you if you put in just s some garbage some noise it doesn't really m w matter all that much
it w sounds little bit worse
hmm
but uh it's not a big tragedy
uh where you really w if you want to g do a good voice speech uh you'll want to get the lower bands correct
right right
yeah that that's
and if you put in uh noise altogether it sounds like a whispered speech uh but you understand perfect
everywhere
it sounds like l. p. c. when you excited by noise
by noise
it's better i would say
yeah
uh better quality
definitely better quality
it lower bit rate
but that's a problem
so now we have to kill them both
so so
because i mean gave all the secrets away
yeah sure
i mean qual computers is going to
for any object you measure you use for uh a reconstructed signal and uh
objective measure well it was some those uh distances spectral distances well edinburgh saw probably
yes
so well i mean
if motorola or nokia gets hold of this uh tape then we are in trouble
uh-huh
uh hopefully it by then it will be protected and and everything right
although herve just said that we shouldn't s talk about confidential things here
it's it's uh it's but listen this is a science
that's that's the problem
i mean it's uh confidential to the extent that we are not uh i uh publishing it yet
yeah
but we w we of of course we will
i h
and uh and uh but uh we have to make sure that that uh if qualcomm has a interest of who's funding the work the they have to have a chance to uh to to patent it or something
yeah
but that's about all
this is not a public uh public uh presentation
alright
so this i is not even a problem
yeah
sure
the only problem would be if but you know
i see
nobody can beat p petr uh petr motlicek anymore in i mean if even if if nokia knows everything if you if you sell it tomorrow who did you work for th the uh uh text no
okay
t h. p. h. p.
h. p.
they will take half a year before they would even realise what it is
yeah
and by then so it's not no problem
okay
so that's where that's uh that's uh
oh okay
so so there is a compromise between the the lower bands the the worse stuff you just said and and the more bands the more coefficients to transmit
right
so fifteen is about okay
yeah
yeah yeah
also there are papers about it that f if you have like twelve frequency bands it's somehow optimal
okay
so this
and then there is a compression
what about that
compression is only to really to somehow feed that uh hilbert envelope to yeah
to get the uh
so that you get so that you can't model it actually
yeah yeah
you can model it better
there is no echo or something like reve reverberance in the signal if you really go down with that compression factor to like zero point one something that
yeah
of what
oh oh oh compression
zero point one
'kay
so what is the compression factor we are getting here
so
when you comp uh w what you com when you compress the effectively they'll want the signal which we are modelling
uh-huh
right
and uh so then you get the fitting to compress signal
the sub band signal
okay
essentially if you were in spectral domain you would compress the power spectrum
yes
here you compress the the th this th this i the what ful yeah of d. c. t. of of the signal right
sub bands power spectrum
it's it's s right
and it's still yeah
and so the w then you have uh predictor is fitting actually this compress signal
but you know how much c it was compressed
so you can always expand it back so that you get the c that you get a fit to the to the original thing
mm-hmm
to fit the the
except that if it is different
because uh it ha th basically this opal modeling has a different properties
and uh it's
yeah you just preserve something different little bit
yeah
so we can tell you a little bit more about it
let's say in r. s. s.
this is an uh sort of old technique which uh it
yeah
i think hynek has got ma many papers or some papers over that
mm-hmm
and it was my thesis even
so oh
p. h. d. thesis actually
in i think i read it
a small sorry
l. p. c.
l. uh l. p.
yeah it was s. t. l. p. was called spectral transform linear prediction
it was my first icassp paper ever
it was uh it nineteen eighty three boston
you guys were still in kindergarten right
yeah
right more or less
oh this is terrible
yeah
so but no nobody nobody was using it for anything except it was cute
mm
but that was about it
and uh and but now it seems like that is since since what we are doing here we are normal l. p. c. is fitting uh peaks right
coming back though
yes
but when you are modeling hilbert envelope you don't necessarily want to fit only peaks
yes
you sometimes want to get a basically good estimate of the of the envelope
envelope yeah
so that helps you
because in this uh thi thi this spectral transform allows you to to find the right balance between how well it fits peaks
how how well it fits dips and uh and yeah
right
exactly
yeah
and sort of the so this is g so i think that basically i don't know what else i mean you should be asking questions right
s
yeah
so
uh one thing i wanted to know is any um a good literature on these lines
well yeah
yeah yeah
go on
uh
well i think you can really take those papers from uh marius about f. d. l. p.
uh where you started with yeah
yeah
yeah they are
yeah that's one yeah o uh th oh
about three papers
they are that's really enough on
there was uh the s s s sapa or how it's called the confere then then
i have two with the
sapa
and then yeah this is a this they are two papers in uh one is in sapa one is in uh u. interspeech
interspeech paper i
and one is in in the america uh yes
uh in a c cheju
and one was in the a. s. r. u.
it was from virgin islands
yeah
what is sapa
sapa was a s i i tell you what it stands for statistic and ad and something ad and uh perceptual approaches
i i don't know
i just n
you were
mm-hmm
i was on f i was on a f w s organising committee
mm-hmm
i should know
just something
you don't know
but statistic and uh and something approaches
evaluation that's that's bad
pattern
right
uh pe perceptua and statistics and perceptual a approaches
approaches
okay okay
mm-hmm
'kay
that was uh
yeah
but there are also reports from idiap i think
at least two reports from marius seem to me
but they are the same right as uh as uh and then also is there is some more work actually can be traced down
yeah they are more less they are same like
uh-huh
okay
i think there wa uh the reading les atlas's papers are very good
yeah
mm
because les atlas is doing a lot of work on coding in this domain
mm-hmm
okay
he doesn't use opal model
but he uses d. c. t. and then he p uh so the so so and it and les is excellent guy
uh-huh
yeah yeah
he's very good mathemat mm h very good theoretician
uh-huh
basically he's a he's at stanford the guy
and uh really he likes to write things well
right right
yeah yeah
mm-hmm
so he's very rigorous uh as opposed to s to me for instance
yeah
okay
yeah definitely
so if you read that then it then you know that there are no errors and
sometimes unreadable i would say
okay
yeah uh but um so whatever you g whatever you get hands on from les atlas uh for over past five years uh regardi this two years ago
it's quite difficult but yeah
last year on one of the icassps he had like five papers right
mm-hmm
or various aspects of this because uh he's eager to
mm
mm-hmm
mm-hmm
yeah i think this year a lot uh interspeech there was one paper
but it was regarded to speech recognition somehow
okay
is that so
i didn't even see it
y yeah yeah
yeah
or
it was not something like speech coding or that d. c. t. transforms
uh-huh
mm-hmm
n nothing like that
i don't
so
also i can um before marius left he he has he had actually left himself
but all the files are here
mm-hmm
you know
so all the m matlab implementations of these are here
okay
and there is also one big table that he used he used to yeah
to fill in yeah with all kinds of parameters
he was also playing with all these compression factors and lengths of the of of that
uh-huh
and there is a big table in in excel which you can look at
uh-huh
he has all kinds of speech recognition results right
yeah yeah yeah
it was the first time you start using the cluster i remember or some uh some parallel processing
this wa
uh yeah
because it it it took a huge amount of time
that was a big thing here
and he basically he he was the first one to realise that these these guys are pretty slow to to do these things
everybody hated him for t uh temporarily
so he he he just uh he just uh put here the p. make environment and he didn't stick to any cluster or anything
right
i remember
uh-huh
he just put p. make and run it on uh on all the machines here
uh-huh
so at some point he was using all the available memory by any mistake you know
so at th in the morning all the machines were were just stuck
d no one could ever m move the mouse
i yeah i remember frank came to me and says is everybody was computing like marius we would be all dead
right
but i say frank but i want everybody to compute like marius
and
so these these resul yeah
yeah
so
because he was doing everything in matlab
so it was again ten times more demanding than c. plus plus and then
yeah
mm
maybe yes
maybe no
i don't it's hard to say
now it's not so bad with that if you really write it f well
mm
but he did
he wrote it well
and he did
but anyway anyway
i think so
because i w i in the code that i wrote i was like playing also with if if the mat matrix is parse i really don't use it all
sure
i just multiply from here to here from here to here
r right
not to matrix p my matrix
yeah
yeah
and then i i just optimised it a bit
and also blast libraries and all these sta things
yeah
yeah
but okay
oh well whatever
whatever
that's not important
well it is important you know
but the t
whereas i mean this is something which we never talk about right
uh
i hear it how much work uh does put in uh here
uh
oh yeah
sure it is important for this case
because it's true it's true this that uh that things sped up tremendously since i came
yeah
but still
i mean uh of course partially because they started to buy some more uh more hardware
yeah
but also be p some at least some people basically know how to uh uh write faster programs
yeah
but there is a the back end recognizer which i will give you which is turn around of eighteen minutes or well from eleven to fifteen minutes
uh this is fantastic
normally it would take hour and a half
and used to be two days yeah
mm-hmm
yeah no
uh
no today it was over one hour
it's just like ten times less maybe or five to ten times less
but still still you can you can five times more compute
mm-hmm
so do you already know where uh what is the situation with you
you go back to prague for a while
and then did you get anything in f in france
great
i got some ideas by the way
i yeah
i have to talk to you about these
yeah
i i don't know
yeah
i i didn't try to
i didn't even mail to to chernotsky i must say
uh-huh
uh i just talked to one girl there which told me that he would be possibly able to find me a job there
any any job like related maybe to field
but job
not not anything any research
oh it's that's the that's the would be a pity right
so if if nothing then then i could be able to get the job somewhere
you you ca you t so you don't die of hunger
yeah probably
and so yeah
yeah but t s but yeah
yeah that's not the idea
no
we'll we'll uh we will we'll try something let's see what we can do
um
'kay
so joel your main basically thing is as i told you to t uh when we were walking that uh that what whatever petr did
that it doesn't die but it i it carries
yes
and obviously uh v we very much hope that you get into that and you get excited and you do s more and uh or uh maybe even different things
we hope that you find out that everything was wrong and that the potential is much bigger
yeah
but uh
that it actually works
yeah
it's not that it doesn't work
yeah it actually work that too
right
no
uh
but after you find out the back then it will be that will be the yeah
yeah
then
so we will send you the papers related
yeah
so
and i will point you to all the code which i have
yes
uh yeah
and yes
well regarding this f. d. l. p.
and i and this and this is all on the record
yeah yeah yeah
yeah
so if we uh if uh if we you can hold him to his word
he doesn't send
yeah i can play it back
yeah
yes
so i can just now tell the the locations of all the files and you can rewind
j ju you rewind
browse through the meeting
okay
yeah yeah ferret
yes
so
um so
how we doing time wise
yeah i think half hour it's fine right
yeah
yeah and definite
any any more things
but you will be here until almost until end of uh
yeah until twenty four
november
it's the friday
november
so november yeah
yeah
november
so breaks my heart
okay
it's just like i was just start teaching and then i n i'll need an assistant
mm
hmm
yeah maybe
uh yeah
uh d hopefully it's make m makes uh pay pay some extra
so we'll see
what are you going to t talk or to teach
mm-hmm
it's just that perceptual stuff and
either speech
uh but it's co actually compilation of uh really compilation of two classes i was giving at o. g. i. which is like speech processing and and uh perception
mm-hmm
and so i tried to put it together so that it makes some sense
do you already know how many students you have
no
no
no
i've it's uh i it i should have at least four
because this is a p like uh graduates
but i have one alright
yes
oh it's graduate for graduates
guaranteed
i have one guaranteed that i don't know if anybody else is uh
well i think guillermo was thinking about
uh uh
yeah
bu three i mean four credits
and
or uh a total of four
sorry
i s i don't know
ah
i don't know if it needs to be four credit or not
i don't know how much i like people without uh n not taking it for credit because then they just sit there and having good time
hmm
yeah
but it's okay
no no it's okay
because s s in i. s. it's four uh credits and uh guillermo is taking i think he's g yeah
yeah
guillermo is taking very good
and so i'll i. s. who already have at least two
if uh
yeah we pro i probably get four
well i would like to go there but not just for credits
just maybe to hear something new
and uh it's possible
that's for sure
i mean that's
okay
it was yeah the last time it was for me it was good the course from my from one special reason
because in the f when there th were the flats in i lost all my papers from my school
mm-hmm
all the all the exercise books
mm-hmm
um how to say this
yeah the notes notebooks
notebooks
note note yeah all the notepads and everything all the notes from any courses
uh-huh
so i was remembering what i was learned or what i was taught at the time
but that's good you know
it's uh
so so i have it now back at least partially
'cause all the all the algorithms you were speaking about
yeah
i didn't get into too many things actually
uh uh i would add
we know the reason was that at the time we thought i was teaching with herve
and we thought i we have much more time
yeah
and suddenly we ran out of time basically because what happened was that uh it was supposed to be three hour lecture
now
mm-hmm
mm-hmm
but it was only two hour lecture
mm
and uh herve assumed that it's going to run longer
or i don't know what he assumed
oh
but suddenly we sa s he said well so so where are you
some
i said well i'm just slowly getting into l. p. c.
he said why but i we have only three more lectures
yeah
i have to teach h. m. m. and everything
so i the l. p. c. part was like i had to do it in one hour
mm-hmm
and then everybody was c totally confused i guess
yeah
and
yeah and also in the in the l lab labs the d people didn't know anything about it and they just follow the papers
yeah they were also confused
yeah
it was
where was this
it was at d. b. f. l. yeah
in okay
but
yeah
oh we'll see
okay guys
i think that um this unless somebody has uh still anything incredibly important
uh
not to this topic
yeah
but i can come to yeah
right it's uh ju it's a little bit up to you
later
you have to p you have to back this uh uh ha h specially petr
because just to make sure that and yeah
yeah but anyway after i'm back i'll be still on skype and all these things
yeah
so no problem to contact me until i don't know may next year
okay
so it's fine
uh-huh
do you think that you will be done by may
is it plan
well i would like to yeah
i think so
yeah we made a mistake i tell you
i should
i think if i had to do it again and we made a mistake we should have register you here at e. p. f. l.
you would have had a degree by now from e. p. f. l.
yeah that was a mistake
but i would have to study here for that that long time no
i th
sorry yours you were or you were here t you were you were here how long you were here
two years
two two years yeah
yeah
and i would have to stay one more
where are the
uh well it would be good reason for petra that i have to stay here
yeah
right
right
so is she getting uh uh another position there
or what is the re reason of what a boyfriend huh
yeah yeah
because she has a good position because she has a friend which is starting who is starting a lab there
and everything is it's a great opportunity for her at least
oh i see
so that's good
mm-hmm
mm-hmm
yeah
but the problem is and then she will go back and there's uh f family issues and all these things you know
mm-hmm
mm-hmm
mm-hmm
for a girl it's always the pain
yeah i know
because she has to break for some time at least a little
yeah
but has to break
yeah
and in in the science it's not that easy to to break
i know
yeah
okay
um okay
yeah
so in case i need something on this f. d. l. p. i'll come to you
uh yeah
oh sure
otherwise i am also much more available than i was
a any
i mean when you came it was just like cra one of the craziest uh uh times of this year
okay
okay
uh uh it's not it's not that i was very productive that i was doing anything useful
yeah
yeah
but it just like it's a little bit like writing thesis all the time re writing and change the do make a little changes and uh uh and
but
takes your uh
uh-huh
yeah but i think definitely you are the best person here to with uh related to availability of you
because if if if i want to go to herve i probably call secretary
he's there or and when i can and i there was no op uh no ev every time i came to you you were available
yeah he's ver no he has many more sp many more people so to take care of
yeah
well i'm typically i try to be because uh because you know i mean for s this is also my livelihood right students
at least it
that's great
yeah
so i have to make sure that that that uh they need to know something that uh so feel free basically to stop by any time and um yeah and uh it's not that i know everything
yeah
but
if i know i uh i think i sort of know a little bit like what you guys were doi uh doing right
i think so
but not uh not obvi every detail obviously
mm-hmm
yeah
you know the core which we don't remember anymore programming
what yeah you don't know why why you are doing it anymore
we know the details and you know what what is th what is the global stuff
why you are you doing this
yeah
good question sometime asking
uh ask hynek
oh boy
yeah
ask my boss
oops
okay i think my mic is falling falling
yeah
so i think we go huh
right
yeah
yes
thank you very much
yeah thanks
thanks a lot
thank you
oh
okay
okay
no
i don't uh
should i start
maybe by presenting the project little bit
okay
okay so historically it was um uh last year prof delambeaux in uh his c. s. c. w. classes uh asked the student to design a table
mm-hmm
okay
and all the students and guillaume wa was a student of this class was very excited uh to design such a table
okay
mm-hmm
so he decided to um to make more research on this topic
so the general topic uh is about uh interactive table um disappearing computer um what is the other one
okay
um um na uh in the general fi field of uh collaborative computer supported collaborative learning
okay
so the idea is we have different people collaborating uh in a pedagogical purpose
and uh we know that when we put a computer in front of them uh it doesn't help focusing on collaboration
yeah
so if we make the computing um functionalities disappearing on on the in the furniture
in the wall or other things like that we may more efficiently support uh collaboration than the the learning
so i arrived uh in june something like that a couple of month ago
okay
uh guillaume and uh michael uh are two students that are working uh four four months to their master project
yeah
okay
and they start working on two uh different uh sub projects
mm-hmm
so guillaume is working on the noise sensitive table
it's uh what we are discussing about uh today
okay
so the idea is uh okay w we have in the lab a notion about um root mirroring
the idea is if we can provide a feedback to people working together uh it may help them self regulating their activity their collaboration
mm-hmm
okay
so could be normative or not
in our own case we want to have uh a table that would be accessible by by students
uh at o. p. f. l. we are uh
ok okay
at o. p. f. l. uh the learning centre will be built in a couple of uh years
so the idea we we will have plenty of rooms uh like in libraries or meeting rooms where student will arrive and work
mm-hmm
so if we have this table uh that is accesi accessible to students if they arrive if we provide a feedback of um who is talking
um instantly the uh at one moment or uh through time or the turn taking
mm
uh maybe they will just by seeing an explicit uh feedback of that they will um take profit uh of it and um
so do you know uh which way you give the feedback
light or i saw something like that
yes
okay uh for for uh the noise sensitive table project um we decided to um to take the noise uh as input
okay
and uh give a feedback uh with leds on the table
hmm
so this is uh one of the the possibilities that were offered to us
hmm
but uh we decided to do to do uh it this way
the idea is to have uh peripher peripherical uh information
mm-hmm
we don't want people to focus on uh what's going on uh what on the feedback
so we don't want histogram or very precise information
mm
but we will uh have leds that will be distant
there will be six centimetres between each led with a blurring glass
okay
the idea is to have more um a kind of uh art artistic uh feedback to have a kind of general feeling of what's going on
something about
okay
uh dance
well i guess it's just a restriction we took
so so we don't uh the m amount of money we have to spend
otherwise we could have uh we could imagine to have a whole table of of uh s well of l. e. d. s
yeah
and then y you can really start to to some regions of the table
so yeah
maybe more complex yeah
yeah
so th
yes the the first uh the first idea of the project uh was to have um the whole table covered by leds
hmm
but yeah
but uh for the prototype of this isn't this is not the the way we implement it now
for practical reasons
to the border basically some distance
but uh in fact we have a there was th yes
or
we kept uh one paper sheet
th there was the the restriction that if we cover the le the table with leds uh some won't be visible because uh you have uh yes
okay
o okay
obviously yeah
so um if there is information displayed under the the sheets uh the it won't be um very useful
okay
so we decided to have it uh yes thirty centimetre uh at each side
okay
so uh the first shape of the table the shape of the table obviously is one of the factor on that will change the collaboration
hmm
so uh but we don't want to start with too many parameters
so we start with a table that is approximatively the tab uh of the table where we are now
yeah
and we will have uh a square shape like this that will be here and a second one that would be there
yeah
so we will have something like this
okay
like this
that will be the our first uh real prototype
right
okay
and the so this l. e. d. modules are being uh designed uh now
we should have them in a couple of weeks
weeks
hmm
and uh we will be able to uh start uh evaluating uh the prototypes
uh uh about the c. s. c. w. class that will start at the end at the beginning of november
mm
uh so the student will be asked to design uh a table
so to find the shape uh of the table to get uh who the and put that uh on the um on table uh legs
okay
and we will uh so at the beginning we wanted to put this l. e. d. modules uh in the tables
mm-hmm
but we won't make it because uh for solidity reason of the table
you know it's not very uh strong uh wood
um so we will rather beam uh the l. e. d. on the table
so we come back to a more richer display
b but we will um restrict it to a small uh to have the same display
oh let's
led lights uh that will be distant uh six centimetres between leds
okay
this is for prac practical reason and uh also a matter of time
so we will simulate our
but don't yeah
because uh
don't you think with a beam also you have less problems with the sheets
does
yes
but uh th there are o other problems like um yes the the information display on the sheets
or you don't want to do that
yeah
so we don't know if it's
okay
and we have yeah
confusing yeah
yes
hmm
and we have the feeling that to have the information embedded in the table make it part of the table
true
it i don't know we'll we we will try uh we don't really know what uh will happen with this prototype
okay
no it's a choice
yeah
we are very excited about that
okay
okay uh maybe before uh going on on this subject we can talk talk a little bit on uh
yeah i can just explain my project
mm-hmm
it's completely different from this one
well it's also about tables but the idea is if uh uh the several students come to a table with their laptops
yeah
mm-hmm
they should be able to to share information easily
okay
and uh in fact w what we we are doing now we project um another screen on on the table
yep
and different people are are are able to use their their mouse of their laptop to go to the to the project screen there and uh the project screen is just another windows machine that is running
okay
yeah
so you just have another f computer more or less you can use but you can use it with your your own mouse and keyboard
but physically it's just uh something flat on the table again yeah
exactly
huh
but uh in contrary to to having al another keyboard and mouse that only one person can use
okay
now the different persons can use the the screen um at the same time with the with the mouse
okay
so based on the fact that most of the p. f. l. student have their own laptop uh the idea is the similar idea uh is to okay
yeah
people are coming on a should be able to very easily uh use some um resources offered to them
okay
so so the idea is to help them socialising organising their own work
hmm
and uh not in a classroom setting but in a social place where they could gather
okay
yeah so it's different but still uh yeah it's same
i'll s still the same subjects
it's it's collaborative work
okay
but uh
different directions
it has nothing to do with uh audio processing and uh l. e. d.
okay
yeah
so
okay
okay
so uh maybe we can focus a little uh uh bit more on the what we have done about uh the noise sensitive table
yeah
tell you about uh what we're interested in on the so we start so guillaume started by uh developing the application that get the audio input
mm-hmm
so we want it to have a modular architecture to be able to improve each uh layer separately
okay
so the audio input uh is quite basic no
we u we use uh sound cards to to get uh the signals and to detect to uh on to ha and we have a threshold to detect uh when someone is talking
mm-hmm
at least when the noise is uh at uh is bigger that uh specific levels
okay
mm-hmm
and then we get this information about people talking not talking and to say okay uh
this one is talking for x. time or uh has been talking uh x. percent of the five last minutes
or two people are talking together
so this is more semantic uh layer
uh we call that interaction uh models
and uh uh so when different conditions are trigger are detected we trigger on the interaction event
mm-hmm
so very simple one could be one person is talking
yeah yeah
so it's uh the easy one
and there is uh a lot of programmes now about this implementation
is it's not uh it's not obvious
it's still in progress
hmm
still in progress
still in progress
anyway uh i think the the details of the implementation is not that important
almost done
it's more important that first we want to to have some events like two people are talking or one one started and another started and uh well
hmm
right
hmm
more or less broke into the speech of the first person and so on
okay
and then you can start to visualise these uh different situations
so the last layer is about this visualisation
right
w we will uh we are thinking about the visual grammar meaning that when we have an interaction event that is uh fired
we uh will associate uh a way of visuali visualising it
mm-hmm
so for instance if someone is talking uh we can just have a light that will centre on the point that is uh close to him
mm-hmm
that could be an uh instant uh feedback
and if he has been talking maybe seventy percent of the last five minutes as me
or too long
uh uh it it may be reflected as the um intensity or size of a s a cycle
oh just kidding
mm-hmm
okay
centre on the same point
yeah
and then if there's turn taking we can show waves of light going from uh me to you uh or from other people
or using the centre part of the table to show some something more about the um uh more general uh dynamic
yeah
right
well that's uh i guess it's first prototype i you see we start with uh people two people talk or and don't and don't they
mm-hmm
uh afterwards uh one could imagine that you for example you can detect that someone is a bit angry or is uh yelling
yeah
and wi with different colours with uh with different colours on on table you could uh display this this uh give some feedback
or laughing
ah so you ha you you might have multiple colours
but uh
or yeah
yes
yep
yes
that's uh
sorry didn't get that
in uh we can change inte so we have uh eight by eight uh two times leds
each uh led is actually three leds um
th uh m. g. b. led
yeah
and we can change the intensity
yeah
alright
so it's already quite a rich uh feedback
okay
once we get the hardware
yeah
yes
and just a last thing
so this table is uh two different things
it's uh one object that will uh g provide a feedback to the terminal users people collaborating around uh the table
mm-hmm
right
but it also a tool for us as a researcher to test uh both the interaction event we want to detect and to test the visualisation
mm-hmm
so um we will be able to edit some uh interaction rules and the visualisation uh grammar
okay
and uh we will be able to process to post process some conversation just to see what happens and to uh have these um models on feedback working when people are using the table
mm-hmm
okay
hmm
so i think it was
no it's quite clear
mm
so uh i guess you want to know what you could do with an array maybe
yes
mm yes
yes
everything from um multi switch administration of uh audio and how you can uh analyse it uh what information you can get out of speech and so on
mm-hmm
yes
uh
so
yeah
i have one or or two question
i don't know if you want to to begin with the the explanation about the the release
um
maybe we could summarise the question we were thinking about
or yeah
yeah
yeah it's good idea
o okay
just give some questions uh
so um i have actually two questions that are uh just practical question abo about my um my implementation now
mm-hmm
uh i
so basically what we want we want to know when a. is talking b. is talking and uh
no
right
basic information we need
so and the first information is um about the the noise level
n not the noise level the sound level
mm-hmm
uh because uh what you get from from the microphones is uh a curve
mm
and um a way the way uh it is implemented now uh to detect yes
you have a uh i have packets uh for uh let's say uh this is uh this is uh not uh fixed
mm-hmm
but uh i have packets for about um uh alpha second
so it's uh second
okay
and uh on these packets i want to know the the sound level the average sound level
mm-hmm
so uh the way i do it now is uh to to take uh each top of the curves' bottoms and uh just making leverage this
yeah
mm-hmm
but i don't know if it's it's not really um the best way to do it
but i don't know uh if
you mean the top of the wave form
yes
okay
probably it's uh it's f be a good idea if you have s two uh with um with source like uh books or web page centre
give a lot of information how it is audio programming and so on works cetera
yeah
maybe you you know some at least a good book that's uh dealing with this stuff
oh
maybe we can uh go through the different questions and then you can organise your own
okay
mm-hmm
so this is this the the first question
okay
um i would just add something
uh we are not interested so much in sound level but uh in the level of uh the sound that corresponds to voice
hmm
yes
but i think uh this is two different problems
uh the filtering must be must be done before
mm mm
okay it was just a
and after that uh if you have uh a cleaned curve and you can uh just apply uh functionally
hmm
okay
go on
and uh the second question was about um uh filtering and uh f. f. t. yeah what you can get from it
mm-hmm
uh
okay
and i would add uh one more
general questions
it's about um because what we can uh record is uh sound uh origins
so in po uh so no sonic points
okay
yeah
but what we are interested in is people
yeah
so the question is if someone is moving i'm talking here i stop talking i'm going here i'm talking
hmm
how to detect that it's the same people
if we want to uh integrate information to say these people has uh spoken seventy percent of the time in the five last minutes
okay
obviously we need to uh to know that it's the same people
so right now our practical solution is to have one uh microphone close to um every place where people are supposed to sit
mm-hmm
so we can infer that if a sound is coming in this area it's the same
so kind of trick
but for the beginning it's enough
mm-hmm
uh o yes i will just add something
um
is there a way to uh to from one uh from one stream to uh to build two streams that correspond to the the voice of one people and the voice of the second
yeah
yeah yeah
okay
the
separation uh
yes
and is possible to do this in real time
yeah
that's uh
and a last question that is related t uh our last if i not find another one um
about people if someone is leaving or if someone uh maybe it would be something ev uh quite complex even for you
hmm
if someone is staying here but is quiet or leaving how can we detect that someone is here but quiet
mm-hmm
okay
well you need a camera
i know
obviously
but how to integrate the information
i mean will you have a camera
uh
no
no
and it it this is not uh
not not yet
maybe later on
but
maybe you can detect breathing
oh the wait and the sit
yeah
yeah that you could do
or on the table uh there should be well
yeah but what happens if o someone is standing then
or putting his bag on the okay
but it was just to it's a question
okay uh
i'm not sure we will talk too much about that today
a sound question
sound related question
okay
uh not directly
but it's uh related
mm
well
so in a couple of days we will get this um uh the fire wire uh box
okay
so we will we have chosen one that has eight uh line up
mm-hmm
so we'll be able to have line in sorry
line in
so we will be able to plug uh up to eight uh microphones with uh jack plugs to exhale air with the possibility of extending with eight more x. l. r. uh microphone with another box
okay
so you i think guillaume said that's optic something like that
or
uh yes
yeah
the the communication between the the extension and is uh of the
okay
so you you need a different you need a microphone with um a device inside right
no no no
in fact uh that's uh it's another thing this optic
ho how does it work
no no no
uh okay
well uh m we have
so we ha we have the computer we have the the main box with the eight line ins
and the fire wire port
okay
and it's fire wire
and there is an extension for this this uh this device connected to it uh with uh optic fibre
yeah
it is optic
to have eight more x. l. r. if we need it
ye
okay
but we are not sure to to buy it now
but we can extend it
mm
actually it's not really an extension to the first box just an indu industry standard uh uh protocol between these two uh
that's uh
hmm
it's another fire wire or not fire wire but um
well well there's a special protocol to to deliver uh audio signals and uh its path through uh o um
okay
but concretely you would use that to get higher quality signals
yes
y that's all
well actually just to have the the icsla e uh possibly to to branch icsla
yes
uh yes
well
yeah
we are not sure about what kind of microphone we should use
ah okay okay
so we wanted to uh that's a first thing
so we wanted to have open possibilities
and secondly maybe we will use this box you know to get uh data
yeah
i don't know if in another experiment maybe in another project if we want to have comments of different people around the table or o elsewhere
yeah
uh getting uh having the possibility of using x. l. r. microphone could be uh uh could be neat
hmm
so everything is open
be because for now uh i'm just sampling the sound that uh eight thousand
so uh just uh something very very rel i could uh even uh go to lower
okay
but uh this is just to get the the s the noise the sound level
and how
but uh if i want to record the conversation with uh uh a processing after th
hmm
hmm
you mean you meant eight kilo uh sampling frequency
yes to to have a better sound quality
uh perhaps it's better to have a x. array yeah
yeah
something like that
uh we use sixteen
so that's eight kilo band width
sixteen kilo uh sampling frequency
yes
it it's not bad
uh it's quite decent
okay
um
mm f before answering the questions uh th there's also a point of uh precision of localization if you use an array
mm-hmm
so if you use higher frequencies you can get more precise localization
sure sure
but maybe you don't need it
but uh what is the the gain
in terms of uh position
uh that i can't answer directly
uh uh uh centimetres or uh more
uh it depends on your set up you know
um you have to test basically
okay
m uh what you get is uh the real position or uh just uh the angle at which the the sound comes
um
y you get uh the angle
mm-hmm
the most precise one is the asymmet in the horizontal plane
mm-hmm
then you also get elevation
but it's not very precise
it's more of an indication
and radius is very bad
okay
if you use a planar geometry like this one
yes sure
yeah
um you can use multiple ones and do some um um triangulation
yes
hmm
uh because uh there there is just um four microphones that are eight
eight eight
these are only screws
okay yes
microphones are on bottom
okay but there are in uh in a plan
yeah yeah
okay
because uh at at t. p. f. n. there is a lab that is uh has done almost the same thing
mm-hmm
but they have uh eight microphone that are uh at uh yes the eight um the eight uh uh cor corner of uh a cube yes
a cube
okay
yeah then you might get uh better direction in elevation
but i'm not sure it's really relevant
no we are not very interested in
um no
the elevation no
no
so
but uh what is could be relevant it's not uh almost it's not always the case with the the um
uh if people move forward yeah
yes the the position the the radius of the
ah the radius
yes it could be
th then the r the problem is not the geometry it's the um i you need more than one basically
yes okay
with one you will only get direction
more than one
microphone array
yes
so
because um because i the um the distance between the the microphone is too uh is too low to
uh-huh
mm mm mm mm
mm
okay
well uh so you say this one already works to uh to tell the the direction
direction yeah
um would it also work if you placed uh the microphones at at the border of the table
um
you see now you you have it quite central
yeah
and uh what happens if if you put them here on around the table
would it work as well
or
it's a different option yeah
um we haven't tried that because we are not going to have the special kind of table
you just didn't try
or
mm-hmm
mm-hmm
more uh this is not a good example but we have like a box just bring the box and put it
yeah
so it uh we could not consider that
yeah it is clear this
but in your case it could be interesting yeah
unless people put something on the microphone
yes sure
but um
they won't have nice light uh lighting on in front of them
they would maybe careful
yeah
yes but i think the the most relevant part is the um the other uh the hardware that synchronize the microphones and that
no
right
but that i'm i think after the meeting we can go and talk to olivier about that
but
okay
yes
mm-hmm
i'm not the person for hardware
no
so maybe w uh you could present a different work uh you have done
yeah
and uh i don't know how they are
yeah i'll t i'll try to present uh i guess it corresponds to your questions
so you told us it was different pieces more than one integrated device
yeah
so the the lowest layer would be the first two questions
um you asked about how to detect um activity
currently you're thresholding the t maximum of your wave form right
yes
mm not maximum
the the average on the on the packets
ah ah
oh uh
okay
and you're looking for a peak
uh yes the the i take the the b i g when i go up to the the curve uh i'm uh on the at the local maximum
yeah
yeah
yeah
i take it
then the next uh local minimum and uh taking this uh this range doing average on it
hmm
okay
what would be the d difference between detecting the average or detecting the maximum
uh
yes
difference
what what would be the difference
what is the difference
difference is uh is that if i just uh
it's a kind of filtering already
yeah
mm yes
yeah
and your second question uh was about f. f. t. what can be done with f. f. t.
yes
so um the approach we're taking here is to answer both questions the same time
we use f. f. t. to do detection
we don't use the wave form the raw wave form
okay
so um
a you have uh you have fifteen implementations
uh
we split um we split the signal in small frames like sixteen millisecond
yes
sixty
okay
sixteen
okay
sixteen
um each frame is taking thirty two millisecond of signal just to give an idea
and there is a one frame every sixteen millisecond and they overlap of fifty percent
again
uh-huh
okay
um
so it's thirty two millisecond frames taken each
yeah
each sixteen millisecond
well th these are details
it's just to give an idea
an idea
so something like that
um
so why are you overlapping
well it's uh the the c
i have a rough idea
but uh what is the main interest
because usually when you do f. f. t. y if i'm getting into details but you you apply um a window to avoid effect
mm-hmm
so the beginning and the end it it i it's not crappy
yeah and it's kind of crappy
it's just not very much rep represented because you apply um a window which has this shape having window
precise
okay
okay
mm mm mm
so you use the first and last point to detect what is between
so they're very yeah
no i'm saying uh when you take your signal you take one frame you apply the window uh and the window is simply uh coefficients you give
mm-hmm
and you give higher coefficient to the middle than to the extreme
sure
mm mm
so if you don't do overlap y you will lose information at the beginning and the end
you lose information
um
okay
okay okay
okay
but you don't have to do overlap
i mean uh it's um
yes and then i just uh because uh we are using um uh an open s an open source framework to do this
hmm
there is uh something i don't know if you know i know it uh calls sphinx that is doing uh s sorry
um c. m. u. no
is it from c. m. u.
yes
um uh yeah
doing um voice recognition
yeah yeah
and uh i just use it for the for the for the microphone and the acquisition
right
so uh there is uh already uh an f. f. t. uh module implemented in it
yeah yeah
i didn't test it
yeah
but um
f. f. t. is only a tool
uh um uh what we do release a phase domain analysis
yeah
yes sure
we only use the phase between the microphones
um
y yes for the for the the position
yeah but also for detection
also for detection
yeah
um we have a way so um i don't think i should get into details
but basically the beginning is your signal which you slice into frame
you do f. f. t. on each mic
mm-hmm
and the end is um a number of uh frequency beams which are used by each person to uh explain roughly
so you are
s so when you speak speech is wide band
mm-hmm
mm-hmm
so um the more active you are the more band width you use
so you will get a large value of band width for people who speak
mm-hmm
and uh for the others it will random
it will be a small value
corresponding to breath or a little noise
or just background noise
'kay
and so uh
'kay yes
sure
okay
but you're talking about the microphone array here
yeah
'cause one problem if you use energy based methods which is probably more uh the thing you've been using so far
yes
is that it's not um quite related to location
no
so you can have um uh for one person you can have uh a high energy signal which is difficult to locate and visa versa
strong background noise
um i think in your case you're quite interested in the location
so i would advise to um use more uh phase domain methods
so phase
um
well that's something with f. f. t. s
once you have the fifty for each frequency you have uh the magnitude and the phase
uh-huh
and the phase
uh-huh
yes
so you can compare the phase of the microphones
okay
and this is directly linked to the direction of the person
um
so the magnitude you don't really use
or and for this uh
sometimes we use it but not it's not the first thing we use
i know it's a bit counterintuitive
but um maybe i'll go t to the board
well uh uh uh i did a speech processing uh course and i'm not sure if they a uh they also um mm learns that that
okay
yeah
okay
we more used the face than the magnitude
so uh i guess the
r right for a single channel it's not very meaningful
but here it's relative phase between the microphones
so uh i'll just try to um s summarise
uh-huh
y you have to detect uh an event on one microphone and uh know when it's happened on uh on the other one
no that's what i don't do
no
okay
um this would be valid for uh like speech recognition with a single channel
that would be a very good idea
but if you choose to use multiple channels
um
let's say you have four of them
with f. f. t. you can just uh as i said l look at the phase between the microphones at a given frequency
so the phase the time between uh audio signals for um for this microphone on this microph
um it is linked to this value yeah
okay
uh basically the time you're mentioning is this value
and this is the frequency
and this is an angle in radians
mm-hmm
okay
so uh f. f. t. gives you a measure of these values
uh this i can point to a paper uh i don't think this is the right place to explain everything
but will give you if you look at your table uh what we have developed here
is an approach where um th uh you divide the space in sectors
mm-hmm
for example ten sectors around the table
mm-hmm
and uh
in each sector you will get the value
it's related to the number of microphones around
no
no
it's uh application dependent
for example um
well this is not
and on this one you could have a large value
on on on those ones small values
uh these are number frequencies
which we estimate with several steps from these measures
so to conclude what we are doing is uh we estimate how much of the frequency spectrum you are occupying when you speak
or i am occupying in this direction when i speak
okay
mm-hmm
and it turns out that um this is quite good to do uh detection and localization at the same time
mm-hmm
bec because you know in a sector space there is uh uh this much activity
mm-hmm
okay this is a measure of the activity o okay
yeah yeah
um
more recently um i've worked on uh
um prolongating this with a more precise direction evaluation to know where in the sector the person is
so that uh that's not much work
once you have done this this is can be this can be done quite quickly
and what happen uh if two person are talking at the same time
this it just get two sectors that are higher than others no
then you
yeah y well i i use a value
but then you'll get two large values
yeah
so
and do you get something about the um distance of the guy that is talking or just a direction
sounds
no
just direction
yeah
okay
th there there is a distance
but it's not very uh very effective
well f yeah i it's not uh i it's an inherent problem to the geometry you use
as as you mentioned
it's
mm mm
you can for example if you use another array uh you can intersect lines of direction
mm-hmm
okay
and uh from from this kind of if information you can uh let's say have uh a finger print of the user to know uh if this is the same user speaking
uh
so
mm maybe
well uh uh
not sure
because the the um
uh uh i w mm i wouldn't trust it too much
classically what you do is you extract the signal of the person
okay
mm-hmm
um one interesting thing is that these numbers are not uh arbitrary things
they represent the number frequencies where a given person is dominant
but when you have two of them which might be interesting for separation
you know already when you have done this processing uh w which part of the frequencies of the spectrum um belongs to this person and to that person
which
and then it's easy to separate the signals
you mean that each person will have a specific frequency because i the way he's talking or his localization
yeah
range
no it's more than
um both
it's a kind of uh speaking styles
both
no it's uh
it's it's more an instantaneous um this is still instantaneous
this is for one time frame
yes okay
if you look at all your frequencies for example uh zero to four kilohertz
um
you can split it and say uh all these parts belong to person one here
and uh all the other parts belong to the other person
so
this is this is a bit arbitrary
because uh perhaps uh person two will have uh some frequencies in the range of
that's correct
but then uh you can look statistically it wi it will be negligible um because the r of uh of the difference level
okay
and if you reconstruct the stream from this uh this range you will uh get something uh that is uh
yeah
it's uh you can listen to it yeah
okay
and then you can do some uh maybe higher level um analysis where you get the pitch of the person or
mm-hmm
i don't really get your last uh diagram yes
this
so it's at one given moment still
yeah yeah
okay so you can say that f this frequency belongs more to this person and this one more to this one
and this is
exactly
but some frequency may maybe are not used neither by uh guy the guy one or the guy two
yeah
then it's uh random
and that's why you get these values uh which are random
okay
maybe they are using the same frequency
yeah
so you need to s
yeah but this is very rare
okay
and when it happens one is always masking the other in practice
okay
okay
so um
and can you detect if someone is laughing or angry d uh there is kind of signature uh even if we can't really trust it uh uh s one hundred percent of the time
yeah
no no
but uh i've i've seen quite a few papers i i've n not done it myself
uh
i'm really on the lowest level
um but uh once you have done this as i said
you can uh separate the signals
and um
and do processing on it
do do processing
uh
okay
so uh you can get pitch rate of speech
that's quite easy
pitch
pitch um the uh uh timbre en francais
it is pitch
i'll show you this afterwards
li okay
um so uh for different person this might be quite different
at least for male females
and uh rate of speech
like if somebody is talking very uh in a very energetic manner it might be quite fast
mm-hmm
uh or just energy also
and you can you can um this way you can filter uh perhaps some range that are uh just very low frequencies for uh perhaps uh a noise or
one
yeah also
um that might be an issue with people are bringing laptops
um
the yes the fan
they will b yeah
they might be detected as another another source
uh so you would have to uh classify the sources as human or machine
okay
but again yeah i think once you see the spectrum if it's just pure and stable
now if you don't really detect the pitch ch can say that uh no persons
uh
also yeah if if there's no pitch
so uh
yes but but then this this is very interesting because uh this way you can detect uh if someone is talking
yeah
if someone uh has an uh some noise with uh perhaps putting his uh his cap on the on the table
yeah
perhaps if there is a laptop and uh in one position
so all will go and be detected there
and you can classif uh classify
and this is
yeah
yes
so w what you're mentioning is a pain for us
she' very good
but for you it might be 'cause we're only interesting in getting the speech
but for you it might be quite uh quite good yeah
okay
yes
so i've to avoid uh filtering and smoothing
'cause as soon as you do that um you exclude some of the information
yes
so it's better to keep it for the latest stage
so um um on top of this there's another part uh which is more linked to the tracking
all this was for one time frame
so um
and the the length of the time frame has um an inference of uh on uh which parameters
yeah you can play with it
um in speech it's uh stationary over ten twenty millisecond
and we make a stationary assumption a local stationary t. assumption um which allows you to use f. f. t. and blah blah blah
okay
uh now in spite of that i know some people use much longer windows which is not a problem
but
th there i uh let's say if you use a one second window
uh it's a bit too much i think
uh the in fact the the frame lengths will be uh very uh very uh i
it's not really meaningful
well if you do this
yes
uh like some very small words like yes they might be two hundred millisecond
somehow
okay
or three hundred millisecond
um
they they won't be visible on the on the wavefo okay
yeah they might be blurred with uh silence
yes
so yes
you you might have to play with it just to save processing time like use slightly longer frames
but the the the the long uh the longest frame you would use would be one hundred
yeah at m at most yeah
at most okay
um
simply because i've used one hundred as a minimum length of a speech word
okay yes
mm-hmm
yeah so
um
now assuming you have done this for each time
i if this is your detail or i should use a different
um
if this is your asymmet at each time you get a direction
what is a
excuse me
so asymmet is your direction in horizontal plane
uh-huh
it's an angle
okay
like north south east west
okay
so where are you represent the phase
and
yeah
no no of this is uh really different
mm thanks
okay
i'm just saying that uh once you have done this for a given time frame you can have a direction of the person at least in terms of sector
uh-huh
uh-huh
okay
mm-hmm
and it's also possible to give a more precise direction quite quickly
so uh this was kind of the lowest layer
mm-hmm
now this is a layer just above it which might interest you
um if you repeat that over time
you will see patterns um
for example uh at two different locations
'kay so you can yeah
two different person will speak
okay
so you can cluster those
enter uh when user is
and you will see that uh if it's long enough it's some significant event
um this can be done quite cheaply yeah
mm mm mm
uh yes
and before i forg forget it uh i have one question
yeah
uh you say you do the processing after uh afterwards
yeah
and uh what is the the cost yes the the length
a cost
yeah th
one one or uh bit longer
um well i use matlab
so it's not perfect
okay
it's like three four
yes but matlab is very uh very effective for uh matrices and uh
yeah
but not everything is uh um simple linear
okay
especially this part
it's definitely not linear because you're looking at a maximum energy in a frequency kind of
yes
the most expensive part is here
with matlab i have three four times real time
okay
um you can do sub optimal processing and uh for example here i'm considering all possible pairs of microphones
uh which is twenty eight and the processing is directly um r proportional to that
yes
relative yes
mm
so um you can save on that
but then you lose a little bit on precision
also i i'm using all the small frames with fifty percent overlap
yes
i don't think you really need absolutely to do that
and even if you use uh four microphones to get uh not good
it's not that good in terms of uh direction
okay
um
yeah i would be careful with that
okay
like five six is uh decent
uh six i would say yeah
and eight is uh is good
eight yeah uh i get down now to one two degrees uh root mean square error
uh so you might not need that
there i yes
but uh
that's what i mean
might not be
yeah
yes one two degree is very very small for uh for our application
um
because we want we really want to detect uh if th this is the same person that is speaking or not
yeah
yeah
if there is uh an error of uh let's say uh ten fifteen degrees and but uh it is um capable of uh seeing it as two different person
yeah
there is not problems with the
yeah
yeah
so it could be sufficient to uh yeah define enough sectors and
okay and the number of sectors is uh is not dependent of uh the number of microphones
no
no
so it's arbitrary
i use twenty degree sectors
uh 'cause i had to choose a value
okay
but it's up to you
um
well
otherwise it could also just rely on the frequency band separation and detect that way the different persons and th then you don't really know where around the table these
yeah
yeah
but uh
if there is uh two two person the same sector i see
um
well d depends with how you do it
but if if you place the the microphones uh n yeah
so that's another way yeah
it it's almost like having a lapel yeah
uh
um
that way you can separate where where is the the voice loud with uh or the loudest
yeah
i think it's not necessarily a bad idea actually
um
well it's quite different thing and uh you don't really get uh a name for it
but uh
well uh
if you are able to calibrate your microphones um the ones who are closer to the person will get more energy
mm-hmm
um so you can compare that
it's possible
at the end it it depends a bit what you want
so
if you are
yeah
um
i have experience with that
um
on the side i've done some single channel work which can maybe help
mm-hmm
um 'cause uh it seems to me that you are not definite on the geometry right
no
geometry is not
we have not uh thought a lot about it
yeah
um m this part is quite specific to a microphone array where like they are concentrated in uh some place like in the middle of the table
yes
because if we are distributing the microphone all around the table then we come back to the energy solution
yeah
yeah
is it what you say
yeah
but you can kind of come back to that also
um
with the energy dissolution or with uh f. f. t. too
uh f. f. t. also
f. f. t.
okay
yeah yeah
but th uh uh i think what is very important here is the synchronization of the microphones
r right
yeah yeah
right
it has to be as good as possible
okay um uh i'm speaking about it because uh we wanted uh to do this table in uh a mid tech way let's say a cheap way
yeah
to have not uh very expensive tables
so i don't know if um uh what i've seen w on our website was uh that the this installation was uh a bit expensive
yeah
uh but i'm trying to uh to to to see what is very important and uh what is not uh for
true
but there are many many things
yeah
we can also consider directional microphones
yes
you know no
um so you can uh their pattern is uh not uh the same uh depending on the direction where the person is
the difference between the
so for example if there was a directional microphone pointing there you would get most of my energy but less from you et cetera
mm-hmm
sure
mm mm yeah
you can also do microphone arrays with directional microphones
yes sh i think you have to uh to uh
uh um might not be relevant
but um
what would be the difference
you will not compare each mic with uh all the other one
but just comparing this one with the
uh
more or less
it's it depends on what you want
mm okay
it sh
i guess it's completely other approach
i mean uh i don't know
okay
but what are uh uh
so uh
yeah
so what are this mic for instance the electret mic
they're o yeah omni directional yeah
omni directional
electret
m uh i guess so
okay
these are these are um some kinds of uh and this one
it's the same yeah
yes
exactly the same yeah
okay
expensive
yeah
yeah yeah
ca can you uh say a number
expensive
quite expensive
because because uh of the quality of the the
yeah they are um high quality mics
and they are plug in the on the x. l. r.
or uh
uh i think we can leave this question for olivier
yes
okay
yes
okay for the our we'll we we'll uh
and when you were talking about comparing energy in the case where a microphone would be distributed all around the table uh you're comparing energy and the time delay
yeah
no no
y you would uh assume
because time delay is is too short to be compared or can be neglected
uh you would neglect it
the time delay is is very small
it it's only used for uh getting the a direction when you have a microphone array
okay
but in that case it's not relevant
um you would assume that they are roughly synchronised not necessarily very precisely and um compare the energy levels
mm-hmm
but i have no experience with that
okay okay
yeah
um
now i don't know you don't want to use ah it's almost okay
let's have a break
yes
it's time
cool
okay
okay
so b maybe i'll go back to your questions
yes
mm-hmm
um
so you were talking about the two first question
yeah
okay
and a little bit about same people moving with the clustering
um
yeah
and this also um allows you to separate people
uh-huh
um and the questions i did not talk about was uh going from location to uh identity of the person
um
that is quite different you you need to use a signal you have separated and uh do the type of analysis i mentioned
um from the spectrum you can transform the the magnitude spectrum and um um build model of the person
mm-hmm
um
or actually look at the pitch no
so this one
yeah pitch at least
don't ask me how it's done i i know the theory so yeah
but pitch is
pitch isn't is not enough sometimes
actually uh you can t perhaps just uh just
isn't it the pitch and the frequency
the base frequency of the
i it's a frequency yeah yeah
it's a frequency of your vibration here
uh
th there is one frequency that is the base from for uh
yeah
and then it's transformed through the mouth that's the usual model
and if you have both you can um well you can compare this to to one stored and so get out uh which person it is
okay
both
pardon
mm the pitch and uh and the freque
what
and uh well the things that make the sou the voice
okay s and you can measure measure that
yeah
or
i yeah um it's not necessarily done explicitly but it's equivalent to that yeah
yeah
so again f. f. t. is useful to do this type of analysis
i'm sorry i didn't really get the point of comparing the pitch the pitch is the is the frequency that is okay
um
yeah but it's quite personal
uh
and the way you transform it uh v by the mouth
yeah
you were comparing what with what
and and the the holes in your head everything the the nose and so on
uh-huh okay okay
yeah
and that's that's really uh unique for ev well almost unique for every person so
so uh
and you were talking about comparing what with what
well once you get this information your frequency and uh your vocal contract or how it's called
yeah yeah
uh y you can use this information to compare to to to the frames here
okay
but you want to have the information because the the mouth you move it
it it's an information equivalent to that
no but
it's maybe n you don't need to do the whole uh complicated modelling but
to scan t all the user
no no no no
no no
that that that everything is done through through the voice here you take a voice of someone and then you can get out this information
okay
it's it's not p it's clear it's not perfect but s it's enough to to to use it for for different purposes and uh
okay so you have the p the pitch and you have information about the voice dynamic or
yeah rate of speech is also possibility
okay
um how fast you speak that's quite personal also
but it varies over time um depending on emotion
mm mm mm
that also might be interesting for you detecting emotion
emotion the involvement in a discussion
yeah yeah
if you are saying oh yeah yeah we should
and us yeah yeah so these measures are a way to quantify that
okay
and i is it uh expensive to do
in c. p. u. you mean
um not not that well uh as far as i know
uh p no
no no it's not
but in fact if y you speak of uh a lot of things that are not expensive at the end you have uh something that is
actual
what w w what is m what is more expensive is to um take the decision finally
so your decision can be for example uh who is it or if the person moved
which is probably the most complicated thing like the person goes away then comes back ten minutes later sits at a different place
uh you will need to build statistical models of um the person identity using these measures
so the ones um he mentioned um
i don't know if you're familiar with that
is it called p. c. m.
i thi um well it's it's not a technology s yeah
it's more or less used this to compress audio
yeah
yeah
i have to i want to check it i can show it you afterwards
so um
not really familiar
well i did a course about it but uh i shouldn't say it too loud because um the professor is working here at idiap
no
hmm
hmm
okay so you are the expert
yeah
i should reread what i signed there so
careful you are recorded
okay
s
okay so all this stuff is done from the f. f. t.
yeah
so you have to do f. f. t. because otherwise
also location to identity
uh
all i was saying is that these different measures are a way to uh evaluate the identity of the person
mm-hmm
okay
mm-hmm
so if with location all you can do is extract segments of speech for example but it will not tell you that these are the same person
mm-hmm
it's just a location
but to get a cluster the location that is uh a place where uh noise is regularly coming from
yeah
yeah
yeah so that might be good for example for ten minutes but then the person might move or a different person might come
mm-hmm
mm mm mm
but for instance for a setting like uh here it would be enough because we are not moving
yeah
it is
well unless sometimes somebody goes there or yeah
okay right
yes
but we are uh targeting a place where we don't know i where it will be more flexible
so we need more than just uh location if we want to uh
yeah
yes but it
well uh it i'm even not sure if it's that important to know which person is talking because uh if uh if it i think about a table
mm-hmm
or so something uh physical
mm mm
yeah
uh you just want to know in in which corner of the table uh speech is coming and not uh which person produced the speech so
i agree
i it it is im
maybe just
yeah
it i it yes it is important for detecting patterns
because uh if you say uh let's say uh w how much the person um have spoken over the the five last minutes uh
yeah
yeah but it's not really related to the ah yeah i see it's uh you need a bit both uh
so it hmm
uh if someone come and yes
but that you can do with location if it's only on the short term
yes yes
i think it may it may be okay but it depends how long
y
on on the off line yeah
i would say you might use these measures in a simple way if you do it uh on line
like um to give feedback
but uh you you mentioned that another side of your project is also to analyse off line
hmm
so there you might want to use a
this is uh mm
we had a student here he finished uh one or two years ago but he left his software
and his software is precisely to do that to um cluster at uh another level
to cluster these small clusters of speech uh group them by person automatically
from th from the location
y no from the these measures pitch etcetera
oh
okay
so um
sound
so i uh this is only based on uh you give uh the spectrum and uh uh okay
yeah exactly
so i would say from location at the lower level you can get small parts of speech and then at the next level
mm-hmm
possibly off line you can uh group them into um a speech segment
i'm hoping to have enough time to try um doing that before i finish my thesis
yes
um so if i manage to do some um uh practically usable software i'll tell you
mm-hmm
when are you planning to finish your
uh in five six months abou approximately
okay
but uh the last ones are always the
more extensible
mm not really
more busy i would say
mm
mm yes
yeah
so you said you want to do separation um but ex exactly yeah
i don't know how mu maybe we would be more interested to know that it's not the same people more than knowing that it's the same people
yeah
okay
or to detect that someone is more that was not talking before is talking now
okay
hmm uh i i said uh we want t to know to um to do separation just because of the voice recognition
ah you want to do voice recognition
i mm this is not the yes
you might want
you might might want to do
yes
okay
yes no but but in fact we have uh yes we are designing uh a noise sensitive table just f from your ring
but we are also designing uh a prototype um to analyse the conversations
okay
so uh we might add there a lot of uh features
yeah
so yeah once you have locations it's not a big problem
okay
um
and uh i don't know perhaps uh perhaps if you have two people speaking uh speaking uh at the same time
mm-hmm
uh i don't know if uh voice recognition of an uh such a stream is uh real
no no you should separate them first yeah yeah
okay
so
yes so that's fine
so the type of things i presented can lead to separation
mm-hmm
sure
um it's only a very small step to add
yes it's not um every important feature for now but
yeah yeah
although it might be if you want to um ex extract these features like pitch and uh rate of speech or energy simply from each person
um you might have to do some ba basic separation
mm
mm-hmm
'cause quite often people uh don't realise that they talk at the same time um interrupt each other
mm
yes
so even if you don't want to recognise a speech fully at least um you need yeah
you need to separate it
and uh uh another what uh
um i don't remember
it's okay
you can email later
yeah
um
so
okay
yes also uh to to extract the context
yeah
mm because if you know the words that are spoken you can let's say uh someone say uh he's angry uh about the word he's seen
uh
okay
a semantic context yeah
yes
yeah
yeah then mm
you mi you might want to add uh this kind of this is not in uh my project but
that are further directions
no but i think once you have the voice for a person
you can start to do this and uh once uh people have speech recognition or uh far enough to t
yes
hmm
um
professor was interested to know when people were talking about him
mm uh
ah someone is talking about me let's listen
so it's uh
yeah you could detect one word yeah
yes
keyword spotting yeah
and have a special events trigger if
and lighting a on his office
so um
okay so are you done w with what you wanted to presented us uh in regards with these questions
yeah
i think so
yeah i i'll just say uh if you want i can point to um three papers
um but no i think it's better if i just send you the link it's probably simpler
sure
the link
mm
sure
mm mm
three papers about
uh one im is about this um sector based stuff like uh the localisation and detection
mm-hmm
okay
one is about how to take the decision that somebody's active or not
um it sounds simple at first you think you just put the threshold and that's it but um the problem is uh the
it's n no problem
no it's it doesn't sound simple but yes you can yes
it no you can do that
no more time for problems
there's no problem but i if you want your your system to work in different conditions like cafeteria library
okay
uh uh
um the environment will be quite different so a single fixed threshold value might be a problem
sure
yes in fact uh for now we are using uh a kind of calibration but uh it's still um
s
yeah
so you can do that automatically this kind of things
um i don't know if you're doing that already but uh
yes
okay
yes um uh but in fact you have to sit in front of the microphone and it's uh yeah
people one speak and people two and people three and you are just uh subtracting the the level that you you kept in the other microphones
okay
so uh i have another paper which might be interesting for that for a single channel uh calibration
okay
and i've code on line so for this particular one
okay
and the last one i would say is um the clustering um to um yeah
the clustering of the different locations over time so that you can get small clusters of speech
mm-hmm
um there are other ways to do it but uh i think it's it's important because um in spontaneous speech all these words are quite small
mm-hmm
so you need to do that uh adequately yeah
mm mm mm
but otherwise yeah i'm done
okay just uh a last question um when you mentioned it
um if i'm speaking very uh how do you say it um yes i'm just speaking one word every uh every one second
hmm
yes a
uh is the the event that is detected is um will be uh a sum of uh small parts
slowly
yeah yeah
there won't be uh okay
many small events basically yeah
so you yes you have to to reprocess to uh to say let's say yes
there is a very small um interval
you have to consider it uh
yeah basically uh i mean it depends uh
because this is yes this is one this can be considered as one interv intervention
yeah even if somebody says just yes
i don't know if it's important for you or not
it might be
it might be
might
this is not a very uh easy problem
for the first application we will do with uh prototypes it will be more about quantity uh of speech or how long
yeah
how much someone speak but when we will go to final uh details
yeah
hmm
if i'm talking and someone say yes yes yes from time to time it show that he's participating
yeah
and obviously it makes different that if someone is talking and one is replying never uh nor moving or nor having eyes open
y yeah
yes
um
so i i'll send you links some of the papers are long but you can just um briefly look yeah
okay
go through them
okay
um we can go and see olivier unless you want to talk about something else
no i think uh i think we has already have plenty to read
no i think does this work email
i'm done
huh
does it work if i put in my email and uh
well we can try
try
but uh
no if it's not uh i guess you would have to install it and so on
we have yeah we have o. c. r. but maybe not on this computer
uh no no no you see uh i thought you can put in here your email address and and just uh do this and then it mails me
yeah
that is good idea yeah
it's a good idea
yeah you see i want too much
and the application you are using all of them uh y every time you are using matlab or you are programming everything is based based on matlab
yeah yeah
yeah
once i i um coded the most expensive part in c. just to see so you can have a mix of both
from matlab you call c. and back
mm
sure yes
and after all matlab is also programming so it
and you can code java
but the day you want to do uh on line real time stuff nah i wouldn't wouldn't trust it
you can choose matlab
mm mm mm
mm-hmm
yes sure
okay
you have to code it uh directly to the machine
so
thank you for the information
hmm
my sheet is very uh filled up
i will take yours
i'm writing so only me can read
it's uh a kind of secret language
okay
and it's always the other way around that's how you put it on
okay
i think the the most of the bad words are at the beginning when the people try to put in on
at this precise time yeah
so you start i think right
okay
hmm so we all attended interspeech no
yeah so we are going to talk about the papers from interspeech
so how many sessions you attended
huh
this is not a good question i think
whoo
i mean did you attend any any session
all of them of course
all of them of course
uh you can't attend multiple session at the same time so
yeah
that's really that's really your so any general impression or feedback
oh yeah that's true
ah i cannot put it
okay
bad answer right
so f for any of you it's a first conference or maybe for
oh no no not at all
no i mean in the sense that it's uh interspeech is really big conference for speech so did you attend before
like
yeah i it's not every year right
well geneva that's why i'm here at idiap because i attended geneva eurospeech
uh ok ok yeah o ok yeah so then you're hiding a you have attended before yes
hmm
yeah we met in also in i. c. s. l. p. right
yeah i see see
the first time so
yeah yeah
mm-hmm yeah in
yeah
so how how did you like the conference anyway
i t i
when in compared to to th the others the previous one
uh i think it's quite interesting but only annoying thing is this multiple sessions
and most sometimes you can't able to go to oral talk this oral presentations most of the time
i c
but
yeah
hmm
why why you cannot
because because like posters is you can spend a lot of time posters looking at m many posters than sitting twenty minutes for one oral presentation
yeah
mm-hmm
so in t twenty minutes you can see at least two three posters and you can directly talk to people so
exactly
hmm
yeah
meet
even i found like uh very few people in some oral presentations
right
i think most of the people are like their own posters only
hmm
okay so you attended mostly posters i guess
so how many presentation you you
but yeah
yeah how presentations are hardly handful of like f five or more
yeah
i liked the invited speaker um about the implant in the ear
yeah
oh yeah
ah ok
it's quite good no
he was from australia right
the guy yeah
i think so yeah
hmm yeah
uh he's very famous i think for that right
yeah
he's the the inventor of that implant and for for the ear i think
ah okay
yeah
even some panel discussions on that human speech recognition reducing gap between the a. s. r. and and h. s. r.
it was a bit interesting lot of arguments and
mm
yeah b differently it's mainly the differences different approaches of engineers versus linguists or phoneticians and yeah mm
s yeah
i realised it were that there were panel discussions only at the place where i could see the the t t you know
there were some boards saying that there is some panel discussion
ah okay
uh but i i couldn't get no one knew where is it what it is where it happens and why and so forth
mm
yeah even the panel discussions w i think one is really held in small room so people were really crowded
it was com
yeah
finally i found but
hmm
well this is not this speech is not restricted only to papers and these things you know
hmm
so how did you like lisbon then
no quite good uh
yeah it's
a bit hot still but the bea the beach nearby is quite nice yeah
yeah
yeah
you should try it i don't know
did you go around
yeah w we went to the costa caparica there with the bus
before or after yeah
okay
we we were we were supposed to take take the direct one but we didn't
so you went to a beach
yeah 'cause i
to a like atlantic sea coast or yeah
yeah i stayed i stayed two days before so uh i went you ju you just take the train maybe that's the same i'm not sure
uh-huh
train north
uh it's not so far from lisbon half an hour mm-hmm
half an hour train yeah
yeah
north
yeah
west or north i don't know uh
uh northwest mm
okay so you stayed at the at the same coast not not you didn't go to the island
cross the river where where is the bridge and and then okay so that was a different place
no no no not very far
no no
ah ok we went to like far south to lagos and yeah that wa uh ha yeah
it's different yeah
yeah
yeah with hamed uh hemant and these people
yeah
that was really good those beaches are really good
hmm
yeah
the more south to th the hole through the water
yeah even dolphin in the yeah
but the weather was really hot the south it's more than thirty five
yeah
but i think lisbon those days are pretty good like seem to me quite not cold but still okay like reasonable
uh
lisbon was good um little bit bit mm
yeah even local transport it's it's
oh yeah
but yeah most of the time the buses are really crowded
hmm
yeah i was happy to be back in suisse after few few days it's better to be here i think
uh
yeah
huh
yeah
i was
yeah because it's really big city no
yeah it's big city many people and
no like
i was very surprised that even the trams did have a a. c. there
yeah yeah
i couldn't see it at at all
those new only right
not the old one but yeah
yeah r right but can you imagine something like in
yeah
ah it's not necessary to have it maybe
uh it's a. c.
well
some time yes but not so many days or
it it was much better if if if you would have to spend a hour and a half that uh hemant and the others spent while going with a ca uh with a bus to to the conference centre from from the the hotel that we were
mm
yeah
hmm
oh yeah yeah that's true
conference
there was a direct bus and it took them hour and a half then
yeah
yeah
no re yeah but that's that's not good direct bus is not good like
well y
so you can go to the direct uh ce central place and then occas uh
mm
yeah yeah
yeah
it's
we can take the tram and a train
better to ta
it's it's all conditioned
yeah
yeah that was the right choice but to take something which which was uh direct in quotes
mm
yeah
the easiest way
yeah da
ah
it was n not the f direct as anything else but
mm
uh what is the place uh the the central i mean where we change the bus to yeah in the yeah maybe you can check the booklet
ah sorry
i don't remember the name
is it there
no no no it's uh or s i'm not sure
yeah i it's supposed to be there
uh it sounds sounds like
yeah it's there like i used to find bus numbers from book only
yeah
oh you've got the s
yeah originally i brought it because i marked some papers but yeah
let's go on this was just a
onl only o one which surprised me a bit it was uh speaker recognition i think but it doesn't really matter
they were trying to model uh um covariance of different components for g. m. m. instead of using a diagonal
of what
oh okay
but then if you use a full it's too much
yeah
so they use some approach where they tie them automatically and uh after that well
oh okay
pruning of covariance matrix
it's like uh in
it's more like tying it is still full but different um components are tied different components of the matrix are tied
but what what does it mean tied then
uh-huh
equal
like
uh yeah but then you have to store the whole matrix and plus some extra information what is tied to what or b
uh
no no you have to store a minimum number a reduced number of parameters
no i don
right mm-hmm
and they are tied in a linear way actually sorry not equal but it doesn't
yeah but
it's like uh all the semi tied covariance matrices or yeah
yeah exactly that's it uh
so they ju yeah
uh i don't know about anything like this but
so did they reduce it's in between the direct covariance this is full covariance
yeah
should try to reduce some parameters by tying
interesting thing is that they applied it on speaker recognition and on the features before they had three different ways to um decorrelate the features
tying
oh
and and this they showed it uh without this
yeah
with diagonal g. m. m. or with this and with this with uh semi tied covariance matrices
it was a less much less sensitive to uh which um decorrelation procedure you choose
uh
ah okay
if y so
so they obtain better results with that finally or
a a also better but of course it depends on the number of of parameters you put
yeah
mm
but
mm
right
in your tie in
but if you compare no if you compare it with some baseline let's say you use just g. m. m. with diagonal covariance matrices
yeah
yeah
no i think they got good results with just using diagonals or definitely yeah
yeah i i think i think it was even slightly better yeah
a and no decorrelation before like uh
yeah
maybe i can find it
mm
maybe decorrelation again they do d. c. t. or k. l. t. or they do that
yeah
or l. d. a. is there or
but ooh the the main point is to to uh like make it faster the the the decoding or what
l. d. a. yeah l. d. a.
l. d. a. or like
make it possible to use uh a full covariance matrix
yeah
but but there must be the sense right
because once you decorrelate the data then you don't need to have full i know
yeah
well that's possible why why it should be i impossible
so
no but still there is there is still ev that's why like people come
yeah
that's so that's that means that the decorrelation is not uh optimal right
so so that's the reason
yeah definitely it's not optimum
so it's it's also like doing along along the diagonals all again
mm-hmm
so it's completely impossible to do it with full covariance matrix
why
it's really computationally really uh yeah so see suppose if thirty nine in te thirty nine to thirty nine for every yeah yeah so
yeah computationally e expensive but
yeah yeah
it is yeah
of course from the point of view of computation but otherwise it's there's no problem no
uh there is a thing
uh no there there is not
with okay
yeah
ne no problem but if you see so many models and so many mixtures yeah
yeah
okay so so here you have to choose either many many things to store and huge computation uh
right
but
yeah thirty you can see you c you can't really like even you can't the models itself is like thirty eight times more than that so
right right
so y if you have like five megabytes or ten megabytes of models then yeah
yeah yeah
no
uh depends
yeah yeah
but even i think it's really bit like impossible for the really big systems i guess like storing storing itself
yeah it's this one
so
yeah yeah definitely
it's i improved covariance modelling
it's almost impossible for like l. v. c. aside impossible to use it right
yeah yeah yeah yeah it's really ti
you've got dimension thirty nine times thirty nine
yeah yeah for every you're so you're to store all this thirty
yeah
so yeah
yeah
so there are no results there
it's impossible to use it
and you cannot even train it right
no
no but in the proceedings you can find them
more or less i think
yeah
hmm yeah
they are better yeah
they tried p. c. a. l. d. a. m. l. l. t.
so from
oh so that's interesting
mm-hmm
uh-huh
mm-hmm
i i it's not really anything new but uh the mm they just applied that to speaker i. d.
speak uh yeah different task and
yeah
yeah
yeah
so uh i found one paper interesting
i think you know vivek most of you know
uh this is uh vivek's paper on like variable scale feature extraction
yeah
normally we use to fix it window for feature extraction like twenty five milliseconds or thirty seconds
here he's proposing variable scale because the fixed scale is non optimal for it's non optimum because like for vowels you can have m much longer
mm-hmm
much longer
and for plosives and these things you really shorter like even around less than twenty milliseconds also
mm-hmm
shorter yeah
okay
so he's ki proposing like this variable scale window f uh kind of online for each segment
why it has to be online
yeah mm mm you can do like you can measure and you can do but he's mm basically doing some mm likelihood ratio testing
okay
so if so the main idea is like suppose you have uh one segment so he's trying to find the stationality cautious stationality of that segment
right
like extended as as more as much as possible to keep the okay
yeah as much as possible like but yeah definitely you have to assume some l uh like minimum and maximum sizes of your own
of course of course
so he is using minimum of minimum is uh i think twe i don't twelve point five milliseconds i think
wh what is the minimum and maximum
maximum is uh sixty milliseconds
so it's not so mm
i isn't it smaller the minimum no
so the minimum
two point five milliseconds
whoo
no no i think a minimum is twen twenty milliseconds is i yeah
yeah it's right
twenty milliseconds
twelve point five milliseconds is kind of sift
this is maybe because of f. f. t. u. or these things
from
oh yeah
twenty millis minimum is no no de because of uh
it's no not as small as as it should have been but mayb maybe because of other processing after
i don't know i just
no you can use mol yeah
no mainly because of uh m. f. c. c. computation because yeah it becomes really noisy like if you s yeah
no
yeah
mm
well noisy yes
ten milliseconds means you have only eighty samples for uh and then you have refused twenty four filters the filters won't get any samples so
right
mm
sure
yeah okay
but it's not uh an intrinsic limitation it's just because of ri yeah
yeah because of computation
so even i i think even st uh he can find less than twenty millisecond windows also especially for plosives uh
okay
and the shifting is still the same or not
shifting yeah he's using twelve point five millise yeah shifting is almost same
overlap you mean
o yeah yeah overlap
so
but the problem like
uh w how do you mean to say
like um no how many frames per per second you do have
is it again like uh one hundred frames or it's less or even if you keep variable length of the frames right
uh
he
yeah
you can still keep the same frame rate
yeah he's keeping same number of frames
uh he's using uh twelve point five yeah twelve point five millisecond
because i understand this would have sense for i don't know speech coding where you want to preserve uh or you want to encode it into less frames
right but why do why to do it for speech recognition
yeah
it means that uh
number of uh frames
yeah no wha why to keep variabl variability in the length of the frames
w you want to
wh why not to keep the same length what is the
actually the problem's again uh uh you see the shift is the nyquist frequency if you compared modulation spectrum
yeah
so again if you change this shift the mod the nyquist the modulation spectrum nyquist frequency changes for each window
right
so if you want to do again another high level feature extraction again it will be problem so
so but he's uh like he's he discuss i mean describing this because even this itself is a problem
keeping the f uh fix to frame size because you're analysing your this uh segment many times
right right right
so this shift will suppose if you find one segment of sixty milliseconds and then you're doing this ten millisecond so every almost i think yeah
mm-hmm
mm uh yeah five frames y you're analysing the previ this already segment so
right right right ri right
so again this may blur some frequency transitions or yeah
mm-hmm
mm-hmm
mm-hmm
but the problem is again this uh bottleneck is here like you can't change your nyquist frequency modulation and
right yes
um i have two questions first is essentially how he's doing in that
no well uh once he gets the frame like from here to here then where he advances to to start with c computation of the next frame
yeah
yeah
yeah
so it's so uh so the main idea is like first to take the some some window
some sam some samples then he assume somewhere some variable and point there is a change
yeah mm-hmm
okay
so it's not n it's not symmetric necessarily
then then it's not symmetric i you can cho uh y it's basically uh too like again do for all the samples in that gyro
'kay
so then what he does is like he proposed uh like some like ratio test based on maximum likelihood
okay
so th tha that is really simple like so what he does is like so he he computes the residual
he first he does the l. p. analysis and then he computes the residual
okay
mm-hmm
and he takes the residual energy of f full signal like gy gy gyro samples
fu ok okay so do what do you mean full
the full signal
so maybe i can
some some sub window or the the whole ten seconds of speech or what
the wh the whole window
no that's that like he assumes yeah sixty milliseconds or something he start with so so then he can yeah yeah
it has to be also some somehow
okay something longer window than the one we are speaking about okay
yeah then he can split that window at point n. say point n. so then you will have gyro two no you can segment it maybe
uh w
okay so you have a window and then you split it to s two parts and you shift the the point where you split it or okay
yeah so yes he's supposed this is your p window
so then you can move your like this
you can move your point so that then this will be like one and this will be second
okay splitting point okay
okay
but again he assumes some initial uh sizes for these windows
okay so basically we have two fixed points
yeah
he don't start with the yeah he don't s yeah start with gyro sample or something
he's starting with uh so the l left window is starts at twenty milliseconds
right yeah
yeah okay
mm-hmm
so so you already hear like s suppose this is full signal you're already here
so right window is should end at twelve point two so you're to search basically in this range
okay
so
okay so once you have say one hour of speech you start at the beginning and first you try with twenty milliseconds
yeah
yeah
then you shift to twenty five and so forth until you
yeah and then if you the maximum is sixty millisecond frame for him
okay and and you find the point where where what
so if you don't find anything
where where do you stop actually
sixty milliseconds
if you d
yeah mm i know but you start at twenty and go to sixty but where which point do you choose
no the point is depending on the likelihood ratio
so he got so he supposed this so this is suppose se segment one and this is segment two
uh okay but which which likelihood ratio
so he compute this error here
okay
so and then he p gives some kind of in terms of this residual letter
so this residual letter is for full gyro samples
then there would be suppose this point is say n.
so gyro to n. and then like
so this the b basically the main he questions or here
so he's maximising that or mm
yeah he's for finding the likelihood for full frame and then it's basically likelihood ratio test
mm
so he's comparing the likelihood of the full segment divided by the likelihood of the the sub segments
mm-hmm
yeah but uh likelihood that's something and something
w what is likelihood
likelihood of the uh like this likelihood is uh this error estimate of the residual
okay
so residual power he can compare t so he after do after doing l. p. he can get a l residual and then he can compare the power of the residual
yeah but it has to yeah
so that he's proving that power is again maximum likelihood estimate of your l. p. parameters
okay
so it's basic
hmm
so that which interesting it's you don't really need to do a lot of computation
yeah
you just need to take the error of n uh residual of this full window and then residual of energy of the sub windows and then you can just divide them and then the only thing is like again he has to use some threshold to decide
so
right
mm
yeah
yeah but still
that that's only the p problem
mm-hmm
if
he got uh he's founding something more uh around three or three point five e. s. t. optimum threshold
mm-hmm
but the and another advantage is like it's not really changing speech recognition whatever so not really changing because of the threshold so
mm
mm
okay
uh you don't really need to f like fiddle with threshold a lot so mm
yeah but why do the main value which are comparing to
the the the overall value or overall likelihood or whatever you call it why he's using the whole signal for this
yeah
yeah
yeah
because so if the whole signal was uh steady somehow and it it would be able to be modelled by l. p. model
yeah
well then the residue will be very low
so he's supposing that the whole signal won't be able to to be captured by l. p. model and that the residue would be high enough or ho wh why he's comparing the o to to the overall
yeah
yeah this is yeah i understand
mm
this is this is the actually basically some theoretical proof like maybe if you want threshold you can see and he's coding from uh leven like uh
you know i i don't see the point of dividing over the the whole stuff
no this is from again yeah statistical signal processing
what they say here is like suppose if you analyse two distinct or uh this l. p. analysis in the same stationary analysis window
the coding will always be greater than the ones resulting from this analysis in two windows
two stationary windows
y well sounds sounds reasonable
mm-hmm
so the he's basically based on this theorem so so what he's saying is like if you do this error
mm-hmm
i see i see i see
well
it will be always greater than the mm th these errors of two stationary windows
mm-hmm
okay that's reasonable
because actually if it if if uh the whole signal would be able to be modelled by l. uh by l. p. c. then anyway he has to design some some framing
yeah
yeah
so even if it's very stationary by d um by dividing over this whole stuff he is able to find some reasonable boundaries
yeah
yeah probably
um m ma makes sense um
yeah yeah yeah yeah
yeah this maybe i think yeah this he's getting some improvement but
okay
yeah ho yeah
and
how did you cope with what you mentioned some time before
that if it's a very long session for each twelve point five frame you will actually get the same segment now
yeah yeah yeah yeah
mm
so how d
so he's just uh uh he's normalising the energy coefficient because energy is really affected a lot
ah okay
uh so he's li
that has to be power not energy definitely no
energy like because c. gyro component like so he's using m. f. c. c. so he's normalising the c. gyro component for this t yeah
yeah but it has to be normalised
by the length
then power instead of energy
mm-hmm
power is again like yeah yeah yeah yeah it's time like yeah
energy over length is power
it's okay like samples or you can see root mean square energy or something
yeah yeah
duh duh duh duh duh
okay
so but this so two things i still don't understand
thi this is supposed to be only for m. f. c. c. s and these easy features ah one question i i wanted to ask before
yeah
yeah
does does he preserve within the feature vector the framing he's using finally
because does he somehow put the information about was the size about the frame to the feature vector itself or he's throwing away this framing
no i don't think so
no
no n no you vo what you mean like the window lent
there is no information
something like this because the recogniser could be good for the recogniser to know what was the chosen framing by this extraction
the sixty mil no it i it doesn't really
uh but i think it's he he doesn't use i guess because uh uh then like you just you take these features and you train model so
mm
hmm
it really matters wh what frame shift you're using for models like because how many he needs to use same freq
okay
so so it n uh it might be bad for then for the back end it might screw up the the t speech rate or normaliser
no no wait
no he will get like every ten milliseconds he get one fra one features
like he it doesn't really depend because suppose if you take your t case
like you your window i maybe longer so doesn't really matter like how what size window you use or not
but i tell uh at every ten milliseconds whether you give some features or not really matters no
like so
so it doe you can use uh thirty milliseconds or fifty millisecond window
huh
oh probably i didn't get it too so the framing is actually equi distant
same
yeah yeah yeah
just the windows are wider oh ah i see
yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
yeah yeah yeah right right right
yeah yeah framing it's like it's really yeah
because it would be crazy yeah a little bit
yeah if you have if you're change framing it's really i think even it's really problem no
yeah yeah
yeah it might be difficult
oh i see so so it's it's like this
like if you try even models also i guess if you change
it's not only with this model it's in spectra and shifts in deltas because
mm mm-hmm probably
who knows maybe it's possible to use it somehow but then there is uh information about temporal information is somehow included in such yeah
yeah but it's really complicated i think
if you use yeah that becomes really
yeah
i cannot imagine the transformation to get the modulation spectrum out of such a stuff
yeah
uh
yeah
but this is kind of interesting
there is also some um like uh not paper
but i saw the algorithm i have been using even that called temporal decomposition i don't know if you kn you know that like
yeah yeah yeah the temporal dec
uh i don't know who propose it i just had it from from beambot for like a beambot do you know the guy
he's french um somewhere now in teleconference like mm i don't know where he's working but th we were using it for uh speech coding
mm-hmm
yeah
yeah
so we just had a speech and you had decompose a speech into such segments temporal segments which were stationary inside
yeah
and then you can more or less uh quantise those segments somehow and use it for encoding let's say or and it worked prett yeah yeah
yeah
yeah
yeah first this is proposed by like uh even we read one paper in our reading group you remember that
mm
i have implemented it's quite working well like uh yeah
they were using like s. v. d. stuff singular value decomposition for that and it worked pretty well like i was surprised like
mm
yeah
yeah honza is also worked for his be yeah
yeah yeah exactly uh he was using that
uh i yeah
yeah
so why don't you still use it
ne he was re he was quoting
oh well it's it has been used for speech coding
if it works so well
nob nobody use it for recognition stuff i think i never heard that
yeah but you do the speech coding so do you still use it
but that
no i don't of course
why
yeah that's good question
maybe
yeah he was uh quoting that paper also like v he was telling this uh this is kind of optimisation criteria what this temporal decomposition is doing like
mm
uh
you're trying to segment your s signal into like discreet windows and then so but he was telling like this uh relationship between optimation and and then cautious stationality is not really obvious
right
right
mm-hmm
so stationality is again different no
stationality is this is optimation we want to like see some signal
yeah that's true
few segments which can really represent whole so maybe that's why like this may not be really
mm-hmm
mm-hmm
mm-hmm
that's true
uh it's interesting this
yeah
yeah this one yeah he's getting some improvement n uh this is a yeah
that's important
well there should be after each conference there should be something like ten people should sit down read the papers and then rank them
all the papers
you know a all the all the all the similar papers within one session say sp uh focus to this topic
okay
and say this is the best this works slightly worse than this one
and throw away what is not that good and and th the first three three papers which are the best shou should be implemented and used from from that time onwards
i think people wouldn't like it
many people wouldn't like it
no no no they again
like forget the all the m. f. c. c. s because it's too old and then start building the story on the new stuff and not 'cause it's
right
but again uh getting that ten papers is really difficult task
it takes maybe years and again uh it definitely like who will who will choose the ten papers like and if we asked yeah
yeah it is but i know i know uh th this is just a theory
yeah yeah yeah sure
exactly
but yeah those things are practically kind of really but i think this kind of things what you showed i mean what you said is really good
because
like if people start implementing like some people propose something in feature level some propose in something in model level but these two are really independent no
mm yeah
yes and i want to yeah
when really work combine these two or
right
and everybody's uh like uh using different training and testing data and then you don't know if like
yeah especially features like suppose if somebody come with different good features again people st again use m. f. c. c. s
yeah
they show it works for timit but then you try to use some different databases you see it doesn't work
it looks like
no no it it's not really sure also make suppose uh people you can't really force people to use same features
yeah sure
so so they wo they will be happy with their own features and their own scripts so their bit rate like tend to change features every time and it's
yeah yeah you can
mm
sorry
mm uh what it's a little bit what nist is trying to do no
yeah exactly yeah yeah yeah
yeah
hmm
so
nist evaluations
yeah
yeah bu
because to me it seems that everyone is still comparing to p. l. p. s or m. f. c. c. s
but even nist you can
and there are so many new systems and everything is new but it baseline is still uh t twenty years old and
yeah but nobody you know it's those new systems are still not general like you know
yeah
like those p. l. p. and m. f. c. c. s because everybody knows that di it worked somehow right for any kind of data
yeah yeah
yeah
that's why they're comparing to to that so
once somebody will come with something new okay he he's showing it works for some datas but still yeah yeah
uh yeah
then
so at lea especially l. v. c. s. r. in really big systems then people
no okay so
first it's difficult to to show that it works for all all the datas right because it's really and
yeah
yeah
because yeah it's it's again you don't know
so it should be every papers then should contain all the results from nist evaluation or some standard task then
oh
no then uh there will be only one conference in three years or something for speech because
otherwise
yeah but then we all optimise uh on the same task
uh uh that's the other yeah
yeah
so you cannot get anything new out of that after some time
but again like
okay so it could be you you would have to publish the results on this standard task
and then you could say well i also tried on this and this
yeah but then you run out of time
that's so you can publish only once in three years or
no i ideally you're correct uh but
yeah
you know but then then only it makes some progress this
yeah
but even people are doing suppose in interspeech there was uh some challenge for speech synthesis
so so what's is uh like it challenge was really good like sup they give the database so you have to work on that database
what technique t use is it's your choice like but that database and then the results analysis is they decide so
yeah that's your choice
even speech recognition also some tests are coming like for phone segmentation or something
people give some database and then you have to dis you can use whatever you want and you have to produce even for features also like features also i think
mm
mm-hmm
mm
yeah but can for for example can you use from some data from from the l. t. world
yeah yeah the they they designed the data such a way that it's it's really like really real uh data
for training say
yeah but they give you also training data or only the testing data
no no i just for
no no for s nay speech synthesis it's like they give you some data
oh i uh since this is only okay
so whether like you use for training or l you can you can do like data driven or like model based approach or whatever like
at the end then they will ask you to synthesise some sentence and you have to synthesise them and then you have to send them
okay so so they give you only the training or development data only
so yeah
your training data onl no development training no yeah training
yeah
mm-hmm
ho how how do they how do they evaluate
yeah
evaluate it's again subject to s uh because for speech synthes yeah
i just don't know
so they ask peop they ask people to sit and listen basically
yeah listen and yeah d yeah even uh they it's mostly they use native speakers only because they can really judge well so
i think so yeah probably mm
yeah
hmm
hmm
mm
okay
but they d they don't have any measure like you have an original speech you transcribe it and
yeah yeah yeah yeah
yeah yeah yeah
so even they propose some kind of word error rate
so you have the original speech so i the synthesised speech is there any words which are not matching
mm-hmm
so even speech synthesis they're also uh introduced this w. e. r. term so
okay
uh
but this was really quite successful like in this conference interspeech
mm-hmm
so a lot of people participated in uh i think even they're continuing this for uh next year and
ri i
hmm
it's just t. t. s. right text to speech
hmm
text to speech
right
but uh i heard like even for i. cassp next year there is some com uh like computation by martin krug sheffield
and on this feature extraction stuff and so at least if you make task simple focus
hmm
mm-hmm
then it may be good to compare these features and but if you s use some uh large vocabulary system
it takes t six months to build and at the end you don't know whether your features are really uh so
hmm
mm-hmm
right right
mm
mm
so maybe that's for like people are always using p. l. p. s or m. f. c. c. s
it's it's such a b like lot of time involved so you can't really check many thi
so maybe well but then well no if somebody like nist will have one recogniser and you just plug a different feature but uh it's dangerous
yeah yeah yeah yeah
but at least in idiap we have this numbers recogniser is almost kind of free so everybody is using so that's what we are doing no
right
almost almost like we are putting different features and i think yeah yeah
mm
numbers recogniser is not really different from like uh a f at least in idiap we have almost same
hmm
yeah
uh
yeah
al almost
but maybe you are using twenty nine that's for you it's different but one more
yeah
we are a couple of people at idiap and there are already two s two different setups
but at least i twenty seven
hem hemant is using difference
are they
for o. g. i. s
hemant and we're all using twenty seven so
for o. g. i. numbers
yeah
stories and numbers or
different setups
like some people use this setup and some people that
yeah
seems
yeah
uh i think we use di distinct train and test set even se the different sets of phonemes
no but the problem is you're using only digits so maybe that's how you
different
well i don't use only digits
my m. l. p. s are trained on everything and uh test set is digits yeah
no but test set is digits your m main task is digits k yeah
uh-huh
that's uh like but o. g. i. numbers are there like now we're little bit convulsed
like we're using twenty seven phones and before it was like twenty four twenty five
hmm
but it's better like once you have like whatever the back end
so you just
then you can put features like whether they're gammas or like spectral entropies or m. f. c. c. s or whatever
mm
yeah
would be mm would be nice for aurora maybe to have that
then at least you can see
uh
yeah yeah yeah
for for what
but aurora is
aur aurora
aurora task
ah
yeah
oh yeah
so but aurora is it really big database or i mean how much time it takes to set up system and then
no no but yeah yeah
no uh it's
it's fast no
i dunno i i've been working with that and
but the problem is aurora again these models are word based models no
yeah
right yeah yeah
mm
yeah so again here we use triphones and so but definitely
hmm
i d if we want to show noise setting it's you have to show on aurora also like aurora is real time
yeah
for noise conditions yeah it's pretty good
well th those f recognisers are are made there or just you just use them that's it
yeah
you don't have to play with it
hmm
she even is f it was forbidden in the time right so you have recogniser just use it
yeah
yeah you cannot play with that
don't play with it you just play with the features
yeah yeah yeah
because of the voices wouldn't be comparable then
but yeah
yeah right exactly
yeah at least i mean wha those studies i think people already did for even in i. c. i. c. s. l. p. two thousand two there is special session on features for aurora
so
yeah yeah
ri right
so yeah yeah i yeah yeah
yeah yeah i remember
with david pearce he was
this icsi features and this uh s uh s uh o. g. i. features and all this
yeah yeah exactly
uh
so there are already people but again like uh at the end like for l. v. c. s. r. people are using p. l. p. s or m. f. c. c. s or nothing of these fancy feature
hmm
because who is the one who makes who actually uses what we d try to do here
these are companies or because it's not scientists scientists just start from p. l. p. and then design the new features
new back end or new anything but they start from the old stuff
but who is the one who is using these results which we publish and try to make
yeah
new
but maybe my have a f for publishing another paper or something
we are using those results more or less
yeah but once you once you finish your p. h. d. you go and it's over
mm
but not everybody go
yeah
not everybody
many people stay so
and those who don't
they stay and publish another papers and they but they they don't turn into a life no
but maybe guillaume you can tell no
into life
like uh you worked i with these siemens people or no siemens or these daimler chrystler
yeah daimler yeah
what kind of features do you use like do you use um any you don't yeah you don't
i don't know
you know they're extremely secretive
ah ok okay
mm uh-huh
i had a hard time just to get the signals
okay
so i asked other questions but uh it's quite tough yeah
ah ok
yeah even s yeah
yeah
i didn't discuss anything with sunil also like i dunno technical discussions anything
yeah
because
these kind of things are a bit yeah
yeah they have to yeah
yeah yeah
i i won
but do you have any like feeling that whether they go for all these new features or they usually use only mm
yes
i wonder which level they are using out of what is there
they have yeah they have to do some test in their mercedes some speech recognition test mm but it seems now they mm at least daimler
maybe yeah
they mostly work on dialogue management uh but not much on features and recognition
mm-hmm
hmm
but even they don't believe like with one paper or two i guess because at least for them no p. l. p. s or m. f. c. c. s
hmm
no
yeah sure
they know that okay these things work on every task so okay we can pu put hands on these things yeah
but exactly
yeah
yeah
i d i mm
they grab
i doubt they are trying right now
hmm
huh
i doubt that at daimler they are trying right now but maybe other companies mm
yeah yeah yeah yeah
hmm
maybe like yeah f because sunil is working in nokia he's a expert in kind of features or yeah it l i think
uh
okay so we can hope that nokia will be using tandem tandem p. l. p. s
but yeah we're not sure even sunil won't tell us
no
yeah i cannot
well many people place with tandem right like m. i. t. or who is using that some not m. i. t. but somebody
no no n no this uh cohen you mean like uh uh
i dunno hynek told told us that somebody's using that um very actively like okay
it it works for them and and they are close to like industry like uh you know
hmm
there is it's a research group of i know i don't think it's icsi
oh ok
huh
so it's not related to icsi
huh
somebody else or i don't know somebody new uh s but i think some t somebody like a. t. and a. t. and t. or what
uh
but this was signal company no like
this voice signal company hy hynek always mentions uh cohen's company with what they're using you n yeah
cohen
oh qu yeah
jorda jordan cohen
you me i don't know he's even if qualcomm
voice no no voice signal
no
no no
they make uh recognition for these samsung phones and yeah
now y oh yeah yeah
for right right
no i don't know if it's
yeah but it was
uh they have like really s many recognisers i guess
mm
yeah i think so
maybe definitely they may be using p. l. p. s or you know
yeah definitely
maybe they are using p. l. p. s and but i th i believe that there is still some stuff up to yeah
yeah rasta or rasta or something you mean
for rasta or whatever else like all those decorrelations and transformations
mm
yeah because mm
hmm
i think it's there but more or less it's again based on m. f. c. c. s or something like that
hmm
hmm
because they grab whatever is certain to work and they they use it
yeah but again
or maybe traps
they don't use anything which is to uh too new which is not that safe
yeah too new is really definitely because like want to at least see i at least four
no more or less i think yeah
five years of results of some new features and some consistent results or
it's like a it's like a nasa you know they use four eight four eight six
machines to to to to put two n uh space ships because it's it's known to work perfectly well or pentium
ah
uh space or ah okay
right
not any p. four or whatever because it's safe it has been working for twenty years
and then only it safe to put well not twenty but it's always yeah yeah of course
yeah yeah yeah
that's true it's true
mm
but that's different situation because right
yeah
they need that it doesn't create that much yeah
of course
if something happened with the machine and uh i don't kn the alloc system it doesn't matter right
but yeah d
yeah uh another issue is like again the computational issues no
somebody will fix it and change it but
mm yeah
if they want to make on mobile they don't want really use some fancy really expensive computationally expensive features or all these
sure
mm
mm
hynek also told about this cohen ce cell phone which he was showing to to work l uh with the l. v. c. s. r.
yeah yeah it
yeah
he he was saying that there is something really really uh simple the decoder i mean not the features but he was mentioning something to the decoder
this is just there is almo
it's just phone recognition or something like
even even not viterbi just even something simpler
yeah something like no d. t. w. or something i don't know i'm not really sure but he mention that
yeah
yeah
but most of the time mobiles they use d d. t. w. kind of thing no like
all these uh so voice calling yeah voice calling and these thing because that's easy like
uh i don't know
do you think so
yeah
oh yeah yeah yeah yeah that's true
because they don't really need to put lot of uh memory and these things otherwise if they want to build a real
yeah sure
yeah
mm
but there you could send an s. m. s. i think or something like that
uh you could dictate text so
hmm
yeah yeah yeah
where where
that was impressive
even on the phone
mm
on a phone yeah
yeah yeah
n some new one or
the phone that uh cohen yeah voice signals
from that c cohen's
yeah cohen yeah yeah
yeah but it's that's a similar one to what herve has for example some he was showing it uh live on m. l. m. i. c last m. l. m. i. conference
oh uh-huh
yeah
and but which uh phone it is
you can look at the video and play it uh
it's samsung some some new really new phone like mm
f samsung something
it uh i'm not sure
where uh some but some which you can buy right
yes commercial phone
it's
yeah
but uh the software is always available or like
it and you can train it like only your speech or it's general uh it's quite interesting yeah
what do you mean always
no the software is again on top of mobile or like it comes with your mobile
i don't know that's
well they they just bought a mobile and based on the o. s. it's using they they they developed the software
no the thing is usually these kind of these kind of facilities are like no not normal so so they may charge more or like yeah yeah
no this is the development phone this is not the commercial stuff with the software
yeah
ah ok yeah definitely they may charge for more money f again some extra bill for this using this recognition engine or something
okay uh-huh
they just use the device
or you you can just buy that application right
yeah
yeah
i don't know like it's like you you've got some mobile phone
by by what
and then you can buy from another company some such application wh you can dictate your s. m. s. or whatever
yeah
i don't know if it's already the case right now
s i don't know if it is done now but like
yeah but maybe like if it can't really recognise you it will be really annoying it's better
but have you ever used like dictation system for windows
those uh there were many of them
yeah i have used once like this dragon that was kind of good like yeah
yeah drag the mouse there
and i heard that it worked very very well
because even in when i was working in uh like in edinburgh like one guy
um
he use i he got some problem with hands and then he was always using this n uh dictation even he used to write lot of c. plus plus code with the dictation like
alright
it's really good like so
but you ought to really train and then you're to kind of uh yeah
right newer speech okay
you had to get used to the system not the system to you
i get used to the system
yeah yeah it's really like you ought to get used to the system
okay
okay
like you how to say all the callings and this thing system how t but it's really funny like
how to say okay
he is able to use it for like like years i mean he used to write a lot of code and you know it's really great
mm-hmm
it's nice
hmm
by the way
you should be the one to ask is there anything if i'm just a p private person and i want for free any software which is able to read me a book in english
uh for example that festival am i able to put the text to the system and to in real time to listen to the output
yeah yeah you can listen festival
festival is able to to to read just a mm normal plain text in reasonable comprehensible english or so that i can understand it
read the like
mm yeah
i think yeah yeah definitely
yeah yeah fes yeah i think i think you can do the festival you can just call like uh this there are different kind of again
non native speaker
how you call the festival so you can just give the full there is an too
mm okay
so then you will get the all the caller and other things
if if you want to like read full text then you can say like the full text
yeah
like those syntax and then it will speak till it finishes the text
and it's in real time on a reasonable machine
yeah it's real it's yeah
it's based on the diphones diphones right
diphone yeah yeah
that's why it's real time like otherwise it's bit difficult and it's okay you can easily understand so it's intelligible so
yeah yeah
okay
yeah i think it's very good yeah
okay
uh festival is good like now it comes at all the linux boxes also so in so already in this
mm-hmm
'cause the the diphone that i was tried to install it and there there are the voices like cat voice and these voices this is not the one
no the there are so many voices like again
because uh i don't know which which um what i what is running where uh if it's diphone or which uh approach this is
which voice you want to use
no most of the the festival uh what you get on linux machines is diphone based only
yes
so it's uh just uh wha samples of the diphones and it choo chooses
so they supply few voices
yeah yeah yeah just uh concatenation of the no it's already there if you just put li festival
so you've got it installed in your machine here or
yeah on my on my laptop
it comes wi because it's comes with direct linux software and you know it is open source
or here
festival right
okay
festival is open
oh
yeah you can you can easily yes i d i've tried
a and have you have you tried it
it's
and
but there are some built in like easy voices which you can y uh there is a default one completely synthetic
so you can
which you cannot understand at all
and th then there is a diphone synthesis i think it is the diphone synthesis from the some like something like cat w voice and somethi this is so so
yeah cat voice like there are like they they have few
but it's this doesn't sound very nice and we were playing at the uh summer school with them actually with the authors
uh-huh
and they were playing us some other other approaches and it it sounded like a human it was great but
yeah new voices like yeah
yeah that's the difference that tha in views this unit selection
it's not diphones you have really large inventory of the speech
yeah
so this is not this is not for free or something
uh those voices they're not yet released
yeah
no no it's free they'll be releasing soon i guess
but it it's not here so far
so maybe you can just check no i it's it's here on the web then it won't come with your linux software
so you have to again download from uh their web page
okay i'm i'm fine with this but i can make it run on my machine
yeah you can download now
yeah yeah yeah
it the voices are called multisyn multisyn uh sl uh that's some voice
okay
okay
so you can download from the voice from the web festival
and and the engine is is in the festival itself
yeah yeah yeah yeah
so it's just a voice to to okay
yeah yeah yeah
so voice is like the database of the parallel speaker who speaks that this text so
okay
mm-hmm
it was really large database so it the voi the quality will be better because you can find similar yeah
so it's still still real time
it's more or less but not exactly like uh it's two times or one point five times or something
hmm
ah okay but but not much yeah
mm mm
but you can prune like how much you want because
yeah yeah
okay
so this is again like uh that's kind of my p. h. d. work how in this system like how you choose the units and how you concatenate
mm-hmm
so there are again cost functions and viterbi
hmm
yeah it's very difficult and
so you can you can always optimise you can put some thresholds and pruning and then you can make it real time
mm-hmm
yeah yeah
so then again compromise uh between the quality and yeah
alright
yeah yeah
hmm
but still it's good like now
th you can just check multisyn and then voices
okay
uh it's right i mean
uh yeah yeah it's really good
and you just uh have chosen some text
any text you just put in and
yeah i just s use the douglas adams uh uh that that book you know the mm how it's called
yeah yeah yeah yeah
but only sometimes like it can't really call this yeah
okay
just general english textbook i i cho i tried
and it can read uh how does it read from which um from which uh how to state it
uh is it uh possible to read p. d. f. s or just standard text
no the t. t. x. t.
uh standard text
whatever t. x. t. right files
yeah
yeah ascii file is
yeah ascii file basically
uh-huh
you have to but you can take a p. d. f. and convert p. d. f. to ascii
ascii and but only the problem's again acronyms and sometimes it expands sometimes it may not expand because it's not in their dictionary so yeah
yeah
well let's
yeah
it was a line with hashes and it was hash hash hash hash hash hash hash hash hash hash
oh really
it's not in the dictionary like if we again it's problem like so
but those things you can add like if you're really familiar with festival so you can add always these
uh i'm not then i don't want to go too much into details just a little bit
yeah
but at least these things okay like it won't really make mistakes so often like sometimes
mm well i can prepare s sorry
anyway who is the author of festival
alan black and paul taylor they started r festival in ninety six or something
these are the edinburgh people no
edinburgh c. s. t. r. yeah
edinburgh
and i thought it that's the guy from c. s. l. u. from portland who was there during f
uh f oh uh this ma this johann waters or like no they d what they did portland o. g. i. they did l. p. c. based synthesis
yeah but there was
the festival is alrea already like it's one first you start with th
no no but that that was the guy who's on a wheelchair now
he cannot m move even he's very in like indic how to say that
like he cannot have he just can speak only through some festival system or something like that
ah okay
mm
he was the auth no yeah h he was working i think in w o. g. i. even
from
he's very famous but i thought that he was the author no
i don't know
no no actually the b
it was developed for him like he was just first tester i think of the system
ah okay okay
something like that
yeah maybe because
like it's not t text to speech it's just the uh uh synthesis which means which is more or less the same but i dunno
ah ok
hmm
yeah first they started in c. s. t. r. with alan black and paul taylor then then it expand to many places
yeah
so it's somebody and simon king is playing with that right the t guy
because if somebody is fil no simon king is he's one of the others but rob clark is the man that you met um
mm-hmm yeah voice
uh uh already
okay okay
that i know
yeah
it's
um uh
i think that's enough
yeah
n uh
so anything uh more about lisbon or interspeech
no other papers it's just one paper and and festival
i it's enough yeah
from linux it's very im interesting
okay
okay
n uh
yeah
mm
oh my god
yeah still doesn't feel natural
yeah
i i wish you know the the the the room would just detect when an when a meeting's started it starting
voila cool
okay
so you better start
i should start
it was your idea
so
yeah
no so i thought that we might s t speak a little bit about speech coding because nobody is doing here speech coding and i would like to have some maybe feedback because except me
i've i've supposed to some speech coding stuff here with hynek uh but you know that little bit at least that uh based on some let's say hilbert transforms using a longer temporal context and deriving some parameters would be tranf transcs transmitted to a decoder and
so it's a little bit different than the stuff which people are using now which is like a l. p. c. based
and but we are at the beginning with everything more or less
so still um we can't uh d encode a speech
but of course there is there are many problems which we still didn't solve and the biggest one is quite similar to l. p. c. stuff where people still don't know how to exactly encode a carrier or the source signal
we know what to do with the envelope or how to approximate the envelope let's say
um when you have got
well maybe uh is is the white board working
or or not
oh you mean that it would be nice to plot at least s
um y maybe show us the general sort of outline
yeah at least on paper
um maybe i i can i can
you can write on the paper yeah
yeah
yeah at least you can write on the p
it's it's okay
you keep w okay you can just write it on the paper
so what we are doing now yeah you mean
yeah
okay i uh everybody knows l. p. c. stuff how it works
right
yeah celp
so i don't have to present anything mores
but it's uh m more or less very simple
we have let's say at the beginning there is some speech signal
what we are uh we might see it uh in very simple way that we are using some hilbert transform h at the beginning to create analytic signal
the analytic signal is the signal which is a complex which you can create from the uh real uh uh some sequence
yeah
right right
and if you get if you apply hilbert transform on this on such a speech signal like a real trajectory
then you get a complex signal and if you take just the amplitude then you get hilbert envelope code
so i well i i don't know
yeah let's say ups
so is this different from the original p. l. p. two stuff then is that
yeah it's u it's not p. l. p. at all d
uh 'cause that's what you started with wasn't it
hmm
mm
this this stuff that marius
no but marius is it's similar stuff
no he's it's pretty much the same
no marius is also using like hilbert transform and then
okay
uh you're lit i know what you mean with the pu p. l. p.
they are applying p. l. p. with some iteration with this this one approach
so they are doing some smoothing of a spectrogram in two ways
okay
yeah yeah
h he's parameterizing it both temporally and across the spectrum yep
one was right
both
right
but p. l. p. is using just the spectral uh direction
let's say you are doing uh for every twenty millisecond processing one one feature vector
yeah
here you are processing one spectral band frequency band right
yeah
yep okay
so it's different direction which we are w using
yep
but anyway this is very simple
so applying that uh absolute uh absolute operation you get a hilbert envelope
and of course then there is the phase
yeah
so it's just the complex operation
mm-hmm
and that's more or less all what we are doing
so now what we know what we know is how to approximate that hilbert envelope
we are ap we are applying that hilbert uh him what is the marius' uh stuff
yeah to that
so he knows how to encode uh the hilbert uh envelope using like l. s. f. s or l. p. c.
yep yep yep
uh is some kind of d. c. t. or again yeah
yeah ok
you are applying again to some linear prediction model after that
yeah
mm yeah but it's a it's a it's a different linear prediction model isn't it
but it's uh right it's in a it's a little bit difference in not applied in the frequency domain
yeah yeah
yeah
it's a complex linear prediction or whatever
so instead of classical l. p. c. domain where you have a spectrum let's say something like that
how c
and you are applying some linear prediction model which is trying to approximate the spectrum right
so this is frequency
yeah
in our case we are we are trying to approximate s kind of instantaneous energy
yeah
so if this is a time and you get one and add one frequency band you can see something like this
yeah
and we are trying to approximate that envelope which is
yeah
that hilbert envelope
yep
hmm
right
mm-hmm
so again we know what to more or less we know what to do with the hilbert envelope
okay
we know that we can apply linear prediction model and it works pretty well
okay
but i if you want to really construct the speech signal or the you need also the phase signal
you need the phase
yeah
ooh uh
which is in uh some sense quite simple for voiced speech signal say
because use linear phase or
but s uh the phase no you ac it's a phase or you can encode it like a carrier
well
yeah uh oh okay
so the carrier is if you know uh amplitude modulation right
you may see something like there is one cosine which is uh very would have quite a f right
yeah
yeah
same frequency
well it depends on how this i i mean you're talking b yeah just the carrier
okay so it's not necessarily phase but if you're using some sort of sinusoidal coding it's phase yeah
yeah
it's called like the phase
right right
yeah
exactly
so the this is the signal which you also have to somehow encode or transmit from a code of the decoder in order to re synthesize it right
okay
okay
w
what so what sort of bit rate do you get for the um encoding of the this the hilbert transform
so
the s the spectrogram
what do you mean
w what sort of coding do you get so far for the no no no no f f yeah
again
for this one
for the the linear prediction model
for l. s. f.
yeah
yeah yep
well it's uh just a linear prediction
classical way
i mean oh okay w well if you want to see it in more details i mean
uh wo well it's no no no but what sort of bit rate do you get
is it is it uh id do you have any sort of m idea of what sort of band widths
oh you mean uh yeah bit bit rate you mean
main bit rate
what is
yeah
okay yeah
good
sure sure
so whereas we are what we are now is let's say something like one point two kilo bits per second for uh that hilbert envelope
'cause
oh
okay and that's in that's with the fully optimised sort of compression scheme or that's just the raw data or
is
it's again a roughly estimated somehow
okay yeah
but we still know that we can go down and right
yeah
sure sure
you just cut out m bands and just use interpolation or whatever
exactly yeah
yeah
i don we are using like fifteen bands
t so that's one point okay that's with the full spectrum basically being used then
right
but they are first they are inter oh well integrated into fifteen bands using oh classical way like in m. f. c. c. s or in p. l. p.
you just apply some those uh triangular windows or something like that in order to to get a li really like just fifteen bands right
yeah
yep yep
ah okay
yep
yep
and each band is then processed independently
yeah yep
hmm
so for one band we more or less have w like w one hundred bits per second
okay that's quite good
okay
so and hynek was showing me how scalable it is in terms of um you can take half the bands away and still get decent performance
for hilbert envelope
right
right right
you take you take three quarters of them away it starts to degrade but it's still intelligible that sort of thing
you yeah you can just right
hmm
right
right
yeah
yep
okay
s
and that's without doing any sort of um prediction of what the missing bands might be right
you just leave them out
uh right that's what we did
i mean you you shou you could be able to do some sort of code missing data sort of bayes stuff yeah
yeah sure
yeah
sure sure
yeah
there are many things we would wouldn't at all
but yeah exactly
okay
but now what i r really trying to do is somehow approximate that uh carrier signal to do something with the carrier
okay
there are many simple things which you can do like uh quantization quantization for example
yeah
it it would be it would be nice to have a scalable scheme though wouldn't it
like because you've got a nice scalable scheme for the for for the the coding of the the smooth spectrum
hmm
right
it'd be nice to have some sort of scalable coding scheme for the for the voice signal as well right
you mean something like uh f uh that celp coding system where you're or wh wh wh what is no what is exactly scalable system
hmm
well i don't know i'm just
what you mean by that
well at different bit rates
so the actual uh excitation as well
oh yeah yeah sure
this was yeah
yeah yeah
because i mean it'd be nice uh l let's say if you had twelve hundred bits for the for the sp smooth spectrum and twelve hundred bits for the voice
for dif yeah right
right right
yeah
but i think this appr approach can do that because you really can split it into several bands
and then you could scale them both
yeah
sure sure sure
and you can decide how many bands you want more or less
yeah
so
i have a question
hmm
is the scale linear or is mel scale like in m. f. c. c.
yeah this is a bar scale we are using
is it bar scale like in like in sp yeah okay
yeah or mel mel scale so it's uh it's being uh more wider for higher frequencies and of course the s the spaces right
oh yeah type
the overlapping is different right
yep
yeah
hmm
mm
but what i w my sense is that it is not so much important still
s
i mean it doesn't matter if you're als use mel scale or bar scale
hmm
uh
but right yeah
no no
just long as it's some sort of non linear
but that's what we are using yeah
yep
okay and
uh actually we are using just gaussian windows here instead of those triangulars because they are more uh no
s so
oh okay
okay
m
smoothed
or like apply more
the place more emphasis on the
it's better than for decoding it's better to play with them because they they are not zero anywhere you know
hmm
ah
they are they are approaching or in they are in zero
yeah yeah yeah
hmm
but actually they are not
so d you don't have to care about some zero values here and but more or less it doesn't matter yeah
okay
we are using just gaus gaussian windows
yeah
okay
so after you're doing l. s. f. s so or like i mean how you're finally hand coding
hmm
okay so l those are that the hilbert envelope is um is approximated by linear prediction
ah
so you have l. p. c. coefficients which you can transcribe into l. l. l. s. f. s which are right exactly
oh
and then vector quantize or whatever
yeah
yeah
so first you apply these triangle filters and then do l. p. c. coding or like
yeah
right exactly
so first uh the approach is quite sim simple
yeah
so at the beginning we apply d. c. t. in order to get to frequency domain
yeah okay
yeah
then you apply those uh triangular or gaussian windows
filters
yeah
so this is done for one second eight thousand samples for eight kilo hertz sampling frequency right
hmm
oh okay
so for such d. c. t. trajectory you apply those uh gaussian windows
and then i so you split it in two frequency sub bands
hmm
and then each one f frequency sub band is more or less uh
you can do the l. p. analysis on each sub band yeah
right
right
exactly
uh uh
you just apply l. l. p. so auto correlation let's say or you can do power spectrum whatever
yeah m yeah ok
yeah
yeah
yeah
yeah so you for each one you get l. s. f. s here
yeah
hmm
yeah
mm-hmm
so how many l. s. f. s you're using and
uh well i'm using now like twenty l. s. f. s per one second per one frequency band
so times fifteen
oh okay
so but you how many bands you're using
twen that's t it's twenty times fifteen it's not
fifteen
if you're you're not skipping any bands or like oh ok fifteen into twenty then
no no
if i just keep all them so twenty l. s. f. s each one is um
like uh
hmm
is quantized by four or five bits
okay
so it's it's yeah it's three hundred
ah
of what
three hundred bits
it i mean it's it's total of three hundred sort of parameters per second
oh yeah
um
two
yeah yeah
yeah
but phase you're not encoding anything
yeah
exactly
phase you're directly transmitting that
you mean this phase the the hilbert carrier
uh no th yeah yeah yeah
or no of course we did
the phase of hilbert envelope
well y you're not you're not carrying transmitting that at all really at this point in time
yeah
i uh
you're not transmitting at all like
uh w well there are many things you can do
we don't well the first thing what you can really do is just to replace it by gaussian noise
yeah yeah is noise
so you can really use t like in uh l. p. c. system
fourier
and and you get whispering type synthesis yeah
yeah
right
exactly
or you can replace it by some cosine one cosine generated in a cen centre frequency of that gaussian window
yep
or one of these glottal pulse things
yeah
f and just use basic l. p. c. ten style
right
yeah which is which is probably i mean
yeah
if you're going to aim for like a very low rate code to below five hundred bits per second i guess
that's that's probably fine
it mi it mi yeah
so what is the celp standard now
but
like it's it's two kilo bits per second
uh the lowest standard is melp i think which is twenty four hundred the standard
or the
oh that two two kilo bits per t
it's been implemented at twelve hundred f bits per second using more more complicated quantization schemes and stuff like that i think
ah ok
ah
some
twelve hundred
yeah
i think so yeah
yeah it's possible some of it
i s i saw that they used matrix quantisation on the l. p. uh on the l. s. f. parameters or whatever
yeah
mm-hmm
yeah yeah
but
but i mean that's quite it becomes quite computationally intensive
r right
but i mean i imagine the same sort of approach could be taken with yours as well
well i'm just comparing with uh l. p. c. ten standard which is like classical l. p. c.
yeah
a little bit optimized
no
so there in the there is i think two point four kilo bits per second the bit rate for that
hmm
yeah that's the same
twenty melp's a lot better quality though
yeah definitely
yeah
yeah
but this is codec centred no
this is no uh i mean l. p. c. ten is just l. p. c.
you have code book
so
oh it's not codecs code book
no no no
there is not code book
no
oh ok
just noise or just those impulses
oh
yeah celp is
celp
no no
yeah it's it's it's around one kilo byte like
i think i think i think i think celp or celp or however you pronounce that
yeah there yeah yeah
it's about forty eight hundred i think
yeah
yeah yeah
yeah
four point eight or something
yeah that's a i think even g. s. m. and all this g. seven two nine
yeah
or based around that
yeah yeah
yeah
on based on celp
okay
right
at least it gives
it's not terribly interesting though really
but still they use a code book no
so that's really uh it's maybe better than like using just random noise or
yeah
so i'm
well you you've well i mean you've got a bunch of options haven't you
you can use like uh a codec sided or you could use a
yeah sure
yeah
yeah
well more or less what we didn't do is analysis by synthesis right
so that's what celp is doing right
yeah
sinusoidal based
mm-hmm
no
so yeah so this is what we do and uh that might help a lot of course
yeah yeah
sure sure sure
yeah
yeah but what's more interesting
but w yeah exactly
huh
i i mean 'cause c i i i suspect there somethings like um celp
that's that's the question
you're gonna get h lot higher band width aren't you
i mean it's a high band width standard
it will be
so yeah
yeah yeah
yeah sure
yeah
for example uh there what i also did was uh a simple peak peaking algorithm
so if you take a look on that spectrum of that of that carrier signal
which is more or less like the cosine if you really take a look on that
but it is kind of frequency shifted cosine or frequency modulated cosine
okay
right so it's th the frequency still to be changing
yeah yeah yeah
or of course the amplitude is just not constant all time
it should be theoretically
but practically it's not
ah okay
so what you can see for a one second signal you m more or less you already might see some like one
one uh impulse there or spectral line for
okay
but usually there are many others which are s quite small but they are quite important
if you don't transmit them then the signal is quite robotic or something like that
hmm
hmm
so if you're really transmitting just one spectral line
but this is what you can do
and you can understand pretty well
okay
the signal is audible
or if you're adjust uh th find one one line
okay
so i mean
but
how
one speaker and dom dom dominant one in the spectrum of that c uh carrier hil hilbert carrier and you just transmit this parameter
yep
hmm
yeah
'cause it's a bit tricky isn't it
that's it's not like a standard i'm just thinking i mean what sort of opt it's not like you can't just do standard um
you know inverse filtering for um signal reconstruction or anything like that can you
no n
it's even easier because what you have to do is just divide the you just multiply that hilbert envelope by the table carrier
that that's all
uh oh okay and then you just then you just do the inverse f. f. t. or whatever
yeah yeah
inverse yeah
yeah exactly
inverse hilbert
yeah
yeah
okay the oth i mean the other o
so so you just multiply that uh one hilbert carrier which is transcribed by l. s. f. s by that this one i. f. f. t. signal
mm yeah
so
but that's gonna be susceptible to having phase problems is that when you
oh f you mean the phase of that uh of that carrier
or output signal like
yeah yeah
of of course i try to play also with that
and uh i found that it doesn't matter so much which what is the phase because we are using just one second window right
yeah
okay
so of course there there might be uh some uh disturb uh disturbed uh when you concatenate those segments together
but then the phase might be important
yeah
but otherwise i mean i didn't find any anything important with the phase
like great keep the phase zero and it works
or
hmm
and now i mean there is there are um mm there is research uh um pu that's been published showing
you know speech reconstruction from the essentially the spectrogram without phase information
right
right right right
yeah
yeah
so
but it's again a little bit different because they are i they are doing this in a frequency domain
yes
but this is in time domain more or less
yeah
yes but i mean you can reconstruct the the f the th the entire
right
the spectrogram you mean
spectrogram from that can't you
yeah yeah yeah
so you could do it that way
yeah
cause i'm just saying there's a heaps of there heaps of options
like if y you be exactly the same as sinusoidal coding or something like that
right
all you need is the reconstruction of the spectrogram in order to estimate the harmonic amplitudes and
right
exactly
what we can also do very simple is just to get the magnitude spectrogram using this approximation without the carrier just hilbert envelope
and then yeah
yeah
but you just uh get it in in this way in in the way of rob's right
yeah
but you can also get the s short time fourier transform uh and keep it right
ye
yeah yeah
just by refitting
just classical uh frame by frame algorithm twenty milliseconds
yeah
uh but you keep just the phases instead of magnitudes
yeah yeah
mm-hmm
and you can put this together right
okay
hmm
and it works pretty well and then the signal is not uh just uh whispered
then you really hear that there is the voiceness in the signal
yeah okay
oh ok
but uh of course the quality is uh is not so good still
d it's th
but uh you can use it for like two three kilo bits per second and it works
hmm
yeah
hmm
but that's that's the big thing at the moment isn't it
if if you're mm if i if the if the exci if the if the encoding rate's two kilo bits per second for the the excitation component of the signal
like yeah
right
it doesn't matter how efficient your um encoding of the spectrogram is you're always gonna have a high relatively high bit rate
right
yeah sure
hmm
yeah
anyway
so um hmm m maybe it would be nice if you t if you tell us uh what you do with the speech coding 'cause i d i didn't see any of p. h. d. s of you
i think
so if you did something so maybe it would be interesting at least to
i have never done anything
nah
yeah yeah
yeah sure
well one could argue it's it's a field that's quite a sort of a niche these days isn't it
yeah
yeah sure
hmm
um
but yeah but it's more towards industry no
in standards and yeah
like the yeah because i worked in a industry for like a small time
it's true
but they're they used to implement all these coders g. s. m. and i. t. u. standards
so you were when when did you do that
no just before my p. h. d.
oh okay
for like few months
uh-huh
yeah but that's uh like industry it's really a big deal like
so they they they work on a lot of these standards
mm yeah
i think so yeah
well did you say uh who said
yeah
but mostly they're all based on celp like mainly
yeah
yeah
so
is it nokia's being sued in the u. s. for their tri band usage 'cause you know intellectual property
how
you mean using that uh c. d. m. a.
uh no no g g. s. m. because they don't have g. s. m. in the u. s.
or
tri band is g. s. m.
or i didn't have g. s. m. in the u. s.
yeah it's not g. s. m.
right it's uh kind of s no c. d. m. a. is uh another level i think
uh it's f uh okay
c. d. m. a.
no no but c. d. m. is there but now slowly they're introducing g. s. m. also now in u. s. like
no no n
uh well that's tri band s yeah
yeah g. s. m. tri band
yeah yeah
yeah tri band g. s. m. yeah
like the frequencies are different like very uh
yeah
different frequency
yeah exactly
yeah
yeah yep
mm-hmm
and apparently nokia's in a bit of trouble over that one but yeah
mm-hmm
ah
well it's interesting
yeah
now it's really big competition
i think there is a l lot of money in that like right
yeah
should've been a lawyer
yeah
like speech recognition of course it's very interesting but people don't use it so much as s just coding just telephoning right or just
well that's
but i mean coding is a much more sort of it's it's it well i mean it's it's uh it when it boils down to just mathematics to a large extent
standard maybe like established
right
yeah
doesn't it
they s yeah yeah
it's it's just uh sort of it's you know communications s sort of no
yeah
right
right
so where do you think your thing is useful
in c. d. m. a. or g. s. m.
no i i
i think maybe in c. d. m. a. it may be m c. d. m. a. is more like
well what we were what we were thinking about is oh c. d. m. a. i mean there is the b
more time domain
the they they are c doing only
well the problem is this in with this application
or it doesn't have to be problem but one constraint is that we are processing one second of the signal
you can go down of course
but then you are losing little bit of the bit rate let's say right
yeah
sure sure
yeah
so but there are many applications where you really can use it because you don't care about algorithmic delay one second algorithmic delay
like for i don't know if instead of s. m. s. you can really have some channel where you just right
yeah
yeah
sure sure
push to talk and stuff like that
yep
um so probably
and i mean as you say i mean that delay is i mean you can squash that delay to some extent right
right right
yeah
yeah
i n i think as far as the co you know c c delilah's coding goes
i don't think you can probably do much more than what's already been achieved
because to get higher compression you have to you know take advantage of redundancy over longer time spans
yeah
right
so
but you know really the these long line telephones they already have delay no
yep
at least half a second or yeah
yeah sure but i mean that's transmission delay not algorithmic delay
if you add those together you end up with a the nightmare scenario i guess
yeah
right
yeah
yeah
but mobile m
okay
what if s
we might have someone else joining our uh meeting soon
and this one is
oh yeah
i don't know i mean uh you'd be you tried sinusoidal coding based approaches didn't you
which one s oh
sinusoidal coding
well
but the sinusoidal coding is usually m when you s at least what i think or uh what i know is when you are doing sinusoidal coding it means you just take the speech signal at the beginning
right
and you are trying to find to uh yeah to find the harmonics in a temporal domain right for that
uh harmonics and the
yeah but sure
yeah m yeah tr yeah it's a yeah
yeah
but i mean the th the the thing is you'd need ti it part of the parameter set for that is uh the um uh the f uh the harmonic amplitudes
right
and then one way of compressing the harmonic amplitudes is just storing the smooth spectrum
and then you can uh and then you can interpolate yeah
oh
yeah
and then picking yeah
you can just pick the the um the harmonic amplitudes on that spectrum when you reconstruct on that smooth version of the spectrum when you reconstruct
right
more or less i did it maybe different way but kind of algorithm like okay
y yeah
yeah
well i was just saying
trying to find out the strongest or the the most dominant peaks in the spectrum which is more or less the same
yeah
yep
but maybe the bit rate is the problem no
like what david was doing
yeah well i i th it's high
like it's really uh yeah yeah yeah
but th
it's quite a high bit rate
but i mean once we it maybe it's something that's scalable
but you know the the f the interesting
yeah maybe you can just see how many how many harmonics
he was using twenty i think
like yeah maybe you can try to reduce
well it i mean you can use as many harmonics as you want
i m h uh he was just using the fundamental frequency
yeah
yeah
right
and if you smooth it doing a smooth spectrum representation of the harmonic amplitudes
then you only need to store the the the fundamental frequency and and the and the maximum voice frequency
and the f
right and that that's it
and then all this amplitude
and everything else can be yeah s yeah sure
and then you do multiples of right
ah
yeah yeah
yeah
yeah
so and then but then the tricky the only tricky thing that we hadn't figured out was the phase information
yeah
each again
yeah
um but y but uh you can still get a like you get th um basically if you do phase unwrapping and all of these other tricks
you end up with some sort of phase representation which is some sort of monotonically decreasing function
some kind of linear yeah
like it
if it is unwrap you mean
unwrap uh phase
yeah unwrapped yeah
yeah
yeah
so i mean it's something that you could conceivably represent in some sort of low sort of r you know low bit rate representation i guess
right
some function or like a
you l right yeah
and then maybe you'd need some sort of correction to um to correct minor phase discontinuities at some point in time
yeah yeah
i also play with that
and for example what i found i well in this case uh we are not trying to encode the speech signal
we are trying to encode some carrier which is much easier i would say because you can really im you can see that even
'cau
hmm
yeah yeah sure
yeah
yeah
yeah okay
so what i was trying to encode at the phases so i just found that uh two bits is enough for that and you really don't hear the difference
okay
so if you keep all the spectral lines as they were there but you were just uh quantizing with two bits or three bits for amplitude
yeah
yeah
two bits for for phase
so it's okay
okay
the problem is that you have to transmit many of them
yeah
oh
'cause there is not just one dominant component but usually more others which are quite small right
sure sure
yeah
yeah
yep
or what you have to do then you have to decrease the the the size of not one second
true
the size of the
but you have to go down because then you can get just voiced part and unvoiced part
you know one second it's usually mixed right somehow together
yeah yeah
hmm
but you don't do any voice un voice decision no
not now no
no and you uh you wanna avoid hard choices on voicing decision yeah
yeah the that's even advantage i think for this approach
i wi
yeah
yeah
uh uh we don't no want to do that yeah because it's quite tricky
yeah
sorta the modelling it's really another issue like
well that's one of the big problems with l. p. c. ten for instance
yeah
right
yeah
yeah yeah
yeah sure
i it stinks because this hard yeah
yeah
exactly
yeah
and then you have to combine all this harmonic model and noise model
right
so again you may end up some
but for example what we also found is that if you use just the hilbert envelope
'cause
that that one which is trying to approximate that energy in some low band
like ar around two hundred t uh hertz and you take a look on the signal
on the trajectory you can see that it works like kind of um voice detector
oh okay
yeah sure
mm
because uh for a low energies there is usually noise
yeah
for high energies there is kind of a harmonicity
the pe peak uh
yeah yep
so it works pretty well for that
so we might use this one information for that
but but that that two hundred this is what they use for like um st they they do use this for um for um pitch marking in speech
but
yeah i think so yeah
mm-hmm
so this is what alan black's code uses
yeah yeah
but it's very speaker dependent wh on what sort of band width you'd look at this hilbert envelope
yeah
right
uh-huh
yeah
depending on the pitch depending on the person y you'll get a different amount of smoothing and a certain sort of so i mean
mm-hmm
s
yeah
mm-hmm
yeah
you know if it's a female speaker for instance you yeah
that's true yeah
so it's sorta tricky
so that's a you have to tune lot of parameters like i am
yeah
yeah yeah
yeah
yeah that's that's a problem
but anyway you don't really need hard decisions no
sure
like voiced unvoiced
uh n no
uh f
so m maybe it may help you but it yeah
that would be nice n not to have anything yeah
y yeah but from memory that that basic script that they had wasn't wasn't very um effective
yeah
yeah yeah
i mean maybe if you did some sort of initial first p guess and then and then chose your smoothing factor based on that
yeah
right
'cause it it you know selecting at any particular point of what the what the pitch is at the may be inaccurate
yeah yeah
my
but if you estimated it over a second you should be able to get a decent estimate i'd i'd think
mm-hmm
right
exactly
but do you really really need it or like voiced unvoiced
well i don't know
maybe if you we uh really want to improve the the quality then we will need it i don't know still
yeah but yeah
yeah
but it's not really you need t you don't need to specify at each point it's voiced or yeah
n not now
yeah uh well i'm gonna t have a time next next month or in three weeks so i'll try to play some examples there for you and
yeah
huh
well it'd be nice to it would be nice to really see what this what you're a actually trying to reconstruct here
what we are trying to reconstr
this carrier signal what what it really looks l yeah
how does it look like or sure
and you did say it looks like a frequency modulated cosine
yeah more or less
hmm
it's kind of uh not frequency
let's say amplitude modulation when you have ju just the carrier and that modulation signal right
yeah
and then amplitude
but you're telling even frequency's also shifting no
yeah
like your delay
it would have to be 'cause pitch shifts yeah
yeah we yeah yeah yeah exactly
yeah
yeah yeah yeah
yeah
so then yeah then it's not exactly amplitude modulations or it's it's in between maybe
yeah
yeah yeah
it's in between exactly
yeah
so it's not this and that
s yeah
but still yeah
but anyway what also the other approach which is possible to use
so yeah
the other is one to keep the phase like this one like two spectrograms one the phase and one the magnitude
yeah
yeah
and well i can again play it and it works on two kilo bits per second
quite what uh no what uh he was doing he was using it for speech recognition
that's what marius did no like
but but he was keeping all the phase information
what i what i know but for speech coding no no no it was i don't know
no but even the his coded like he just he he didn't do anything he just transferred it that way
for speech coding you mean
he was aiming for he's not really kind of doing speech coding but he want to do it on music
so he doesn't really care about the band widths or he want to have the quality no like
i don't know
i don't know
yeah but even especially the audio series and the that that's what he was telling like
m maybe
yeah at least even ten k. bit
twenty kilo bits also is okay
right
so but he's uh he's not i think finished with all that thing
yeah
he's just transmitting all the phase and then but he's encoding the envelope yeah
mm-hmm
well for example this phase information right
yeah yeah
yeah
i think so
there are m more papers which are using this approach like trying to encode the magnitude spectrum or spectrogram
yeah
yeah
and then leaving the phase yeah
uh the phase or you just uh re can again the phase can be replaced by the noise which is pretty good
yeah
so that's uh the benefit uh variable approach
hmm
so if you really don't have a band width you just can replace it by noise and it works
hmm
yeah
of course then it doesn't sound as the original because it's more whispered or whatever
hmm
but you can understand well
mm
and for example uh if you mention this one approach with the that uh trajectory of the phase
of unwrap phase recre uh i also use because you can do it here when you get into uh this domain where you apply uh or you're trying to compute uh s power spectrum in in order t let's say that this kind of trajectory
yeah
yeah
yeah
it doesn't in fit the same frequency over time domain
but here you are trying to compute uh doing a to do linear prediction
so we are just doing f. f. t. right
yeah
mm-hmm
then applying uh power in order to get um to s to power domain and then i. f. f. t. right
yeah or
so you get the auto correlation coefficients
mm-hmm
auto correlation coefficient and
so before you're applying uh power spectrum
you can again get the you have got a complex f freq frequency or complex spectrum you can get the phase right
yeah they again give the phase
yeah again give the phase
hmm
yeah
and the phase look quite similar like this
so you might see it's is more less like a line
yeah it's like a yeah
oh
and it it does start to get a little bit n non linear towards the end
right
but normally that's that's when the components are not actually probably gonna be audible anyway in voiced speech right
yeah
hmm
so yeah
right
but this phase is different from your carrier no
yeah it's it is very different yeah
like yeah
because you're just doing on uh your uh yeah
then you are doing in different domain
i think this is in frequency domain this in time domain
and also like yeah
um it is quite it's quite sensible to any quantization what i found
yeah
and
yeah
really it looks like the lines
so you just say okay let's p let's put the line there
hmm
yeah
but it doesn't work
re well you can understand
but you can here that there are many artifacts which right exactly
yeah sure
c
c 'cause any sort of error in that in that line is is transmitted is realised in a net as a phase error right
right right
yeah
and the another problem is that uh it's not band width variable
so you cannot say that this part will be the just the noise which you can do in here in this this other approach
mm
so that's why i didn't play with that so m more because i found there are more uh disadvantages than the advantages this approach
okay
so that's why
mm yeah
tricky yeah
but even you can use as a can you use that phase directly
you mean this one
whereas the d yeah this one is direct
yeah if you take just the original phase and the
but this is phase of your d uh spectrum no
like it's not in time domain
right
yeah it's it's it's not a phase
so
of your signal
it's not so then it's bit tricky
yeah yeah yeah
it's the phase no you can again put the that envelope with this phase together because envelope is twe
like how
okay but still you get only the the magnitude of your hilbert envelope
yeah yeah yeah
y y y you have s five slices like n across that way i guess
you won't get the
no no
you g no you get the f
yeah you get the complex complex spectrum with this
no but you started with hil hilbert envelope no
like magnitude of hilbert envelope
no no i started with the d. c. t.
magnitude of uh no before d. c. t. your d oh
no after d. c. t. you are trying this is so kind of again a real trajectory right
and you're trying to first find that hilbert envelope
yeah
so uh let's well so this is a speech
ah ok so input to the d. c. t. is the speech or like your yeah okay
yeah
just you're starting with
no but here what i want to say is really that y it's not part of hilbert envelope it's part of the d. c. t. signal
ah
ah
ok ok ok
so it's not it's enough if you have just this phase and f and the hilbert envelope you can put it together
yeah maybe the then
yeah
ah okay
you don't need the carrier
i mean this is kind of a carrier signal but in different domain represented
yeah it's in frequency domain no
right right
hmm
so i what i think is that we already will need to apply s kind of analysis by synthesis approach mm uh in order to get something
yeah that makes sense 'cause it's a time domain sort of approach
right
um and i mean uh and and in in fact i mean it's what you're doing is so different to most approaches to speech coding that it doesn't matter that we don't know much about or haven't had much i it's i mean it's quite different to a lot of the traditional sort uh so uh voi um you know
what i
no
you mean ye
right
source filter type approaches or or whatever yeah
yeah definitely it's d
right right
yes that's true
so
but i mean that's maybe even the advantage here because you it's not speech d based which means we are not
but now i think people
it's just a matter of minimum distortion time
yeah
right
so you can when i tried and comparing with l. p. c. ten on a uh twice bigger or higher bit rate this work works better it seems to me
yeah
just for unvoiced speech
o i'm not mentioning uh voiceless because that's unvoiced which means whispered
sure
unvoiced unvoiced speech is very difficult to b sort of judge on quality compared to voiced i think
uh yeah but uh when you hear and try to use some examples with the music for example
plosives
yeah plosives are very important though i guess
yeah
right yeah
so maybe it does a better job of plosives
mm-hmm
that's true yeah
uh but anyway it seemed to me pretty good
i mean that there might be
okay
it'd be nice if we had some demos here
that's true yeah
well i suppose have to wait to your i guess
so when is your turn
uh
uh it should be uh thirteenth december i think
oh
oh okay
oh it's a little wa oh bugger
i mean just before
i just uh you won't be here
i won't be yeah
oh you
no
uh okay
you'll practice it before then won't you
no i just swapped it with uh mike perrot i think 'cause h he is not going to be here this time
yeah he's going to oz
and i was supposed to have it in uh in january
yep
so whatever
anyway
so but anyway i i wanted to hear something maybe from you what you are doing f with speech coding because you were you mentioned that
i did yeah
but we're d we're doing a more traditional s s frequency slices rather than temporal based stuff
by
but it was based on like you were using kind of recognizer there right
yeah
well that's w that was one of the approaches sure
yep
low bit rate
and the other approach was was this h. m. m. based stuff which is which is basically just a parameterization of the you know
the the the the um the source filter type parameters and then and then learning the you know training like a h speech recognition system
uh-huh
right
right
but that's not terribly that's got no relationship to this
yeah it's i'm i mean yeah it's different
i it's yeah
but uh it's speech coding at least
yeah sure
yes
speech coding
i i read some of the other techniques
um little standards
but um i mean i think i think you're on the right track with the analysis by synthesis but that doesn't tell you how what sort of bit rates you're going to achieve or um and because you have to do it separately for each um band
i think so
right
yeah sure
yeah
band you mean
right
it would be the i imagine that's the tricky part
um because it would be varying quite rapidly wouldn't it your um your uh code book
like w within each um when you go along the the the b the one second sort of segment of the band you
with different
i don't know
but maybe what we can already do is uh to decrease this uh this distance
we can do a hilbert envelope approximation with one second
hmm
but then we can split that signal into i don't know ten ten uh segments with the one hundred milliseconds or even less
hmm
yeah yeah
and we can apply some other technique for that you know
yeah
well i mean yeah
first you've gotta choose your approach and not worry about the band width
still
right
and then start thinking about how to given 'cause i mean i guess especially 'cause this is a this is a more of a commercial based project
exactly exactly
hmm
yeah
you've g c you've you've gotta i match the quality before you start worrying about other things right
i mean d d do they i mean what what what sort of uh
well th more less they don't care what's uh what will be the quality of the of the or the bit rate
they just want to get something new you know
uh-huh okay
so if you get the v very uh low bit rate with a reasonable quality or really high bit rate
oh okay
well that makes things uh
yeah
with
which is c again different but with uh high quality uh they would be happy with the both
yeah
they're happy
yeah yeah
okay
so you know on one side it's pretty good but on the other you don't know which way you should go 'cause there are many of them
cool
yeah you know the the
yeah
sure sure
and uh
and at the moment you're at sort of a point where maybe you have to make that choice a little bit
right right
yeah
yeah
mm-hmm
okay
well i i will
hmm
w uh do you want to mention your speech coding experiments
yeah
uh
no no no yeah
so you are saying that you're doing something i in india with uh
yeah
but it's mostly like this is uh s celp and these thing
so you know the sub mm like um more details
no i was t uh doing some uh like writing some code for testing and these things where i'm making some t standards for that
yeah
uh which is not
so so th th there are like li the thing these standards
how it works is like they give all the pseudo code kind of thing and then they put severe test conditions
yeah
so you have to pass those test conditions
like then j you can say okay we implemented d. seventy eight or d. se
oh yeah
okay
yeah
al although the standards depending on what standard you're dealing with sometimes it can be quite ambiguous right
yeah
i mean all the m. peg standards are basically this is the container we don't care how you do it right
yeah
yeah
yeah
yeah
yeah
but it's gotta fit inside this this sort of this sort of format
right right
yeah
so that's why it's really even the t standards they give the test signals also
you are t you can't really do it on whatever database you have
okay
so so you are to use the uh uh yeah
and then you have the v and then you have to do m. o. s. um testing and
uh it yeah it's more like uh they define
so i did for some even also
they're also they define all this the speech condition
everything they define
so you need to follow all those
okay
right
i see
yes this industry is again different like yeah
yeah but it's quite interesting with the even with th uh s current speech coding uh technologies
we are they are still trying to use k zap or those r. p. based approaches
yeah i think there isn't only se most yeah
there is nothing new more or less
well ho it
and if i when i was uh listening the uh the talk of uh milan jelinek uh he's the czech guy but he lives in uh in canada
i don't know the name of the university
but they they have uh the pattern i think for celp even
or
ah
okay
celp is from uh a. t. and t. no
um i don't know how it is exactly but they got very very famous for this for that celp
like a. t. and yeah yeah
it the all this l. p. c. stuff is
yeah
what they did exactly i don't know if something different a little bit or not
ah ok
or they just keep those patterns or i don't know how it is exactly
ah okay
mm
maybe hynek will know much more
yeah
but uh when i heard those that presentation they didn't do so much new
yeah yeah
yeah
well i th
i mean uh it was last year and uh i think hynek
no no no
he was asking wh so what's new that you are so famous with that and they n they said okay we we know exactly how to do that
i mean you know not to make any errors like in because everybody knows how to do that
yeah
the
but uh it's not so easy to implement it right
uh no no no
so uh there is nothing so much new really like
yep
yeah that's the main thing even
well the the what's what's new is in the transmission medium
yeah
like you know new like higher band width transmission or uh or like packet packetized based transmission
yeah
right
yeah
and then all th that sort of thing
right
the where th where they're they're not so much looking at the algorithm
but so much as how to incorporate the algorithm within a new transi mission sort of s medium
exactly
yeah
yeah like i
basically s like i mean if you d if you see a lot of papers on like um on uh voice over i. p. or whatever
voice over i. p. or yeah
the the publications are sort of like um how do we deal with packet loss
uh yeah
yeah
right
or or how was it affected by packet loss and and and things like that
right ri right exactly exactly
but then they are s still using like error signal which is going to be approximated by code book right
yeah sure
and a linear prediction which is use which is approximating just the spectrum of for for and everything that that's that's all
yeah
yeah
so still
yeah
and again lot of this stuff like whe even when i was working mostly that company was developing for voice over i. p.
so they're to put all these things on again d. s. p. s
and also it's mostly like how to how many l. p. c. s are yeah how many co yeah it's optimation and then it's even
right
yeah yeah
and optimization of the code and all that sorta stuff
yeah
but even that's less of a big deal now right because all the little um i. s yeah
yeah
again now now now even they're also becoming yeah
right
even the memories are not really yeah
not really
you could trow matlab on a mobile phone these days
yeah
yeah
yeah
well maybe not but
so even i think uh then you can have whatever band width is
yeah
it's short really
well i hope that we still have a a lot of time for that because uh
but no i think uh but still then that's what maybe people are going toward sign sort of modelling no
like i was before when the bandwidth conditions were really stringent then they were using all the p l. p. c. based source filter
i think yeah it's pretty interesting yeah
y yeah
for example when i was uh you know harmonic voice modelling that h. m. m. system which is using used for synthesis more less
yeah which david did yeah
yeah
it's pretty interesting
i mean it it works it works well
yeah
it's good yeah
yeah if you want you can look at his code and
yeah we've got all his code implemented
but only th yeah yeah
so uh it wasn't perfect
right
there was little bit of bugs with some of the matching
but it was pretty hard to tell that it was m not not perfect unless you heard the samples sort of next to one another
yeah
yeah
so that's not too bad
but definitely it's better than co coded speech no
right
different
oh sure
yeah it's really but uh how much you can get the compress these like what you're telling is you can do all these tricks like
and i mean it
yeah yeah it is
well th
yeah these yeah
the only trick is the phase
and we've got a student starting in january who's gonna start working on on how to actually efficiently parameterize the um the h. m. m. yeah yeah
you mean uh in sinusoidal uh modelling
in yeah
and i think i think we've got a number of ideas for the the spectrum
that's easily enough handled just using standard techniques
yeah
but the
and but anyway do you know exactly how it is done when you really have those m. f. c. c. coefficients
which means magnitude spectrum and then you are trying to reconstruct the speech
without phase
without a phase
i've got no idea
uh you reviewed a paper on a
because i i tried you know those th those papers
well yeah i read uh i reviewed one paper like yeah the that's that's from no
but s i'm little confused about it
i don't know how it works
yeah maybe you can look at dates from uh you know east of uh east uh yeah east anglia
but
uh steven cox isn't it
yeah
which one
yeah
uh this uh e east university of east anglia ben milner
university of east anglia
it's near c sort of it's it's near the sorta cambridge side of england i guess
yeah
i yeah it's yeah i can forward you that
they're doing lot of tricks
yeah that would be nice
they're like they're again training gaussian mixtures for different frequencies and then but they can they're following the yeah
oh
you know m but there are some algorithms which were quite uh
no the much more mathematical i think
yeah
yeah yeah yeah
yeah
yeah just basically doing a search through or or stuff stuff like that don't they
yeah
or
no no the those things are again based on l. p. c. no
like mainly like yeah
uh it seems to me yeah something like that
whereas like the pitch estimation in in the x. waves or these things they're all dynamic programming based on again l. p. c. analysis
like try
you know what you can do um maybe
yeah
what you can do is uh take just the minimum phase of which you can get from a linear prediction right
yeah
you know what i mean minimum phase signal
and then construct that
and it sounds quite uh reasonably the two
yeah
but of course they are li it's not original at all
so i don't know how they do that exactly
huh
no
no i've no idea
yeah again like uh no the problem is different for everybody
like these guys what they're doing for distributor speech recognition mainly this uh so
yeah yeah
right
true right
sure
where you've only got the m. f. c. c. s
uh yeah m. f. c. c. s
but th i think i think the i think it was to was it to do with aurora or something
so
no it's e. t. s. a. or something
the okay
european standard yeah hynek really n yeah even it's h kind of aurora framework
for n for aurora we didn't do anything with that
i was
so yeah
okay
yeah but we didn't do any speech recon re reconstruction
no but now it's bit
yeah
yeah now they're
yeah yeah sure
yeah but it w it was for say um say you've got someone who has you know
they wanna dispute that this is what they actually said by the recognition
right
and the recognition network was wrong and you owe me money or whatever
um and then they can say well we've we've reconstructed your speech from the speech recogni input to the speech recognizer
and then yeah m. f. c. s
hey voila it sounds like you uh uh i mean obviously there's a lot more to it than that
there's a lot of sort of well does the quality stand up to legal sort of requirements or whatever
right
right
right
but um
but even at distant point they're planning to use for j uh standard d. s. m. or d. s. it's not
or
oh no that there's a separate set of standards i think for speech recognition
yeah
e. uh e. t. s. a. i. yeah
y yeah yeah yeah
european yeah commission
yep
so
which uh i think requires you know that states the un the information they can send is this
m yeah
yeah
so i don't know whether you tack on any extra phase information or whatever
yeah
you have to deal with what you're given
yeah
so
yeah i yeah all these standards are really okay
yeah
i don't know
i i it would be interesting
you i mean maybe that's the best approach to look at to begin with is just pretend all you have got is
you mean with this phase uh sure
yeah
um because you can also interpolate the pitch information from the the spectrum as well
yeah
yeah
but
yeah they do some kind of reconstruction of speech
they do that
yeah
yeah
uh yeah
so i mean maybe try to see how good you can go without transmitting any of that information
right
that's true yeah
but the quality again problem no like
the pitch was really good i thought
i th didn't think you could really tell
no no
the the eu again european standard what this give us they give the m. f. c. c. s and they give the pitch
yeah
then you are to construct the thing
yeah
but if have m. f. c. c. s then like again you have to get the high order m. f. c. c. s and then yeah then you're have to
yeah but but the thing is if it's mel scaled if you have a mel scale
you get quite fine reconstruction of the spectrum at the lower frequencies it which is what you need for reconstruction of the pitch anyway
yeah
right
yeah
yeah
so i mean if you wanted to transmit with fewer bands you'd maybe still keep the lower bands or or maybe you could still transmit the pitch
so
yeah
the pitch isn't that big a deal
but it'd be nice if you didn't because then i mean that's well
yep
yep
i mean it's worth giving it a go and then men maybe seeing wh what information you can add to the data stream to improve performance
mm-hmm
mm-hmm
sure yeah
um
i don't know
yeah
okay
that that'd be cool
so how about you
so get coding
i've never done any coding in my life
so i just have one curiosity
so this is coding then s you code the speech then you're also supposed to transmit the speech right
th let's say in g. s. m. or something else
yeah
yeah
i remember when i was doing some image processing there were techniques for compressing and then coding
so adding channel information on the image at the same time in order to save sound bits
you see what i mean
you mean like channel and source coding together
exactly
or no
i d was just wondering if there's some s someone was doing it with speech as well
well i can imagine kind of like j. peg operations
which might be more less like it's source coding and then we also channel coding because we just smooth the or just i don't know
well actually when you compress yeah all like first you compress the signal right
i don't know
and then you al you add com some complexity to the signal in order to recover the error
right
right
right
r right right
so i was wondering if by any chance there was something like this in speech with the speech
i don't know
you don't know
hmm
okay
mm i think w
mm
i don't know so much about s channel coding like those huffman coding stuff and you know
ah well i mean huffman's easy enough
i mean it's just standard
yeah
yeah
well it's not the most difficult right
but but yeah sure
they're just standard techniques
but
uh that that's where i stop
run length encoding i'm out of here
but i think again it's different no
like these standards again all these g. s. m. standards
yeah exactly
maybe they have the compression standards and again coding stand but maybe uh i i read ah yeah
yeah yeah
sure sure
and and this was the problem actually because you were
i don't remember anything like yeah they're doing yeah combi yeah the even even g. even normal g. seventy nine normal speech coder
no not not in g. s. m. definitely definitely not
uh
so they have the speech coding standards again
okay
they are these channel coding
then th they some you know source
okay
so yeah
so it's mm
so yeah
yeah b
okay
just one
i mean i i th i think they do try to i mean obviously the the the techniques they they choose are supposed to be less
maybe
you know susceptible to coding errors let's say
yeah
yeah
you know i but i mean that's maybe the the limit to that
definitely
yeah
again yeah i
yeah
so okay
i think so
is it good
h yeah
yep
okay
end
th thank you then
okay
okay
okay thank you
okay
oh
thank you guys
uh if you find some good paper which you might
there was that fam fam waveform pro prototyping cor
with the lapel
so we i think we organise uh just to to discuss uh
sorry
i don't have my presentation
to discuss uh yeah the project alexandre and uh jean marc uh proposed
um
a about uh capturing uh audio video and slide uh in a synchronized way
and so we will start with uh an introduction
uh i think olivier prepared some slides about uh reviewing uh
yeah
current systems
and um
and then even if we don't have many things to to talk about
just to to start discussing about clearly the project and also um dealing with our kind of timing constraints
mm-hmm
and uh
so they're on my they're on a
the u. u. s. u. uh u. s. b. cord doesn't work
and you didn't put on the
no no
they are
maybe you can access through the network
if it's on your h.
yeah
or it's on uh your d. machine
no no
my d. machine
so maybe we wi we will be able to
yeah
okay
should work
just going
what
keep going
so um w yeah we had like five slides y uh presenting different systems
the show must go on
and mayb maybe you we can do that at the white board
mm-hmm
i it's a bit stupid
but uh y you know
i think you remember well the different uh parts
okay
and uh i'm sure uh we can do that at the white board
okay
so uh uh yeah
i will do something like that
yeah it would be great to use the white board
okay
so uh i would like just to review at the different project regarding acquisition system
so basically there are five systems
the first one is called smac which is developed by fribourg and cern
the second one i is your system
uh i would to say the cheap meeting room system
the third one yeah maybe i can share that with you
so the the the first one is uh smac
okay
the smac yeah
should i write
yeah maybe yeah
okay
just a review of current systems uh to introduce
yeah yeah
sure that's interest us
the first one is yeah i will call that a.
smac which is develop by fribourg and cern
the second one b.
which is uh i would like to che say uh cheap uh meeting room or i don't know
it's okay
it should
well cheap meeting room is the you know mm it's a conference room
but for the moment just for the purpose well f for the moment it's just to understand each other so we know we know that the uh
okay
you can say then you
or
it i th i thought it was called pas so i think just use this
yeah
yeah for with pas
pas
it's okay
alexandre
p. a. s.
pas
yeah good idea
pas
yeah yeah
yeah
okay p. a. s.
the third one is um
uh this sounds like alexandre pas
yeah that's not that
p pas project
okay
the third one is called uh the s um this is uh the smart meeting room develop at fribourg which is called the smart
smart mediat uh smart minutes but uh i thi diva
it's diva
n'est ce pas
something like this
yeah
because a sma yeah smart minute is all the process of capturing the minutes automatically
it's diva
okay
but it's diva we can say
the p diva
d. i. v. a. something like that
mm-hmm
the third one is call uh the third one is uh the project that i have to improve the current smart meeting room at idiap
uh for that we will use um uh
yeah a tape three uh okay let's call that
free
and the last one i would like just mention just to for the meeting and this is uh the fire wire
um i don't know if you saw my presentation during my turn
mm-hmm
you did you
yeah
uh okay
e. which is firewire
okay
so i will start just with the smac
so maybe i draw line here
so the smac
the smac project the smac project is a project which aims to do the acquisition of audio video and slide uh for presentation
yeah this project is done with fribourg and cern
but i'm just going to make a very short um graphic
in fact they use um
a card a video card which is call um i. v. c. mm yeah
mm
doesn't matter
yeah
i just write i. v. c.
in fact this is a video card with four um inputs
on these four inputs you can have only video
but uh they want to make also the slide acquisition
so on one input they put um a conversion box a converter which converts from slide
to video
so that mean that we decrease uh the the quality
we have a high quality in slide and we go to low quality to lower quality with uh video
um so this one is just for the smac
now i will just move
and this the three of those are the v the the video
d
yeah
these one are just for video and audio
you can use uh them
and this board does uh the divx compression on the fly
this is uh the box that we have on the table
mm-hmm
the the card that we have on the table
and uh i'd like to add that this c i think it's quite ambitious project because it's with uh the cern
and they w they uh already worked on uh a european project called indico where they they have uh release
deliver a full um kind of conference uh uh software
and uh to to manage uh all the the conference aspects uh uh we have in a conference automatically
and uh i know that at fribourg they installed uh already in in a in a big uh amphitheatre for students
and i guess it's currently working
ah no
either just to uh in parentheses uh we didn't choose that um that solution because they had no um the the slides were not captured very uh in a very uh precise way
that's the point
mm-hmm
mm
mm-hmm
okay
otherwise they uh it's fully automatic
or have have you discussed with them
did you discuss that
is it fully automatic
you don't know
i don't know
okay
well i suppose uh i suppose they can capture things right
uh i think
i mean don't s i don't see why you could not capture the videos i mean with a card like this
but the p i
but i i it all synchronize and i is it doing all what we want but without the slide uh precision
mm-hmm
i don't know
i mean i don't know
but l let be careful
okay yeah
there's one important point
the technical aspects of the way you acquire things should be driven by the kind of processing you want to have
so in our case we need to have a good processing of slides that in our case it means to transcribe with an o. c. r. and then make indexing
we need to have high resolution image
i guess that's what you mean by precision right
yeah
so in a sense that's the point
for us we need to have uh this sufficient resolution images of slides to do what we want to do
so that's why i guess we don't follow that solution
and uh okay
because apparently yeah
and we are su and we are sure that in that uh context of smac project with uh um fribourg working on document analysis uh there were not enough precision un enough resolution in the slides
mm-hmm
as far as i know so far uh they did similar works on meetings document centred meetings
they always worked on manual transcriptions of documents
mm yeah
so they never really took into account a possibility of actually performing processing on the document they talk about during the meeting during in this case the uh the talk
okay
talk conference
the conference the the th the presentation
as far as i know
as far as they published i kn i know the results they published uh so far
so essentially they n never took into account i mean the work at the high level which means basically we have the information coming from here and there
and we n created techniques that allow to starts from the text there and the things that are said and w if we find context
i mean they make some kind of processing
mm-hmm
but as they don't work on the low level so low level it means basically okay take the speech and extract the transcription
i take the image uh of the document and i take the transcription
they basically don't really care of this aspect as far as i understand mm
okay
well as far as i as far as i know i mean they do of course they can do of course slide detection
as far as i know
change slide change detections which uh of course what i understood is also they try to recover the layout somehow
mm-hmm
mm-hmm
i mean given the slides but they are in no case they are extracting the text from the slides
yeah
so with in uh in uh all the cases what i've seen
in all the cases i've seen i mean they s assume that at least you have like a p. d. f. version of the document or what
exactly
and basically they try to match what is displayed
to the document
so first they need to extract the information from the document which is not does not seem to be so trivial
okay
exactly
at least for uh because they're also working with uh maybe more complex documents with images and text and so on
yeah
maybe with slides it's ea it's easier to extract uh the information
i assume it's ea it's easier indeed
but they uh assume basically uh that they have this document
yeah
which is something somehow we would like to relax uh because uh people uh like in it's you may not want each time to ask the person
mm
maybe the person has a point point not the not a p. d. f. version
or maybe he's using excel to do a demonstration or something like this and we'll want to avoid this
mm-hmm
let's say that it makes uh less automatic in the sense that at point you need someone giving the file and putting the file upload in somewhere et cetera
to c to capture
mm
and it is a different kind of processing
mm-hmm
some way is always driven by w what you're able to do
yeah yeah
they work a lot on layout analysis
i know they match uh uh the layout in two x. m. l. files et cetera
mm
so it's a different way of approaching the problem which means a different way of capturing different exigencies in in capturing the the documents yeah
yeah different requirements
but but most you would say most most of the points for us i mean would be valid
i mean slide transition we would use slide uh need to do it slide transition
yep
yeah
yep
to some extent we would like to extract some elements of the layout to disting to have a more high analysis
yeah
mm-hmm
but we would like to do this more automatically and in particular for the text recognition to do to be able to do retrieval uh of slides or points
i mean of parts of presentation
we would like not to have to rely yeah to a first p. d. f. version or any version of the document
so yeah
okay
so the solution to that low quality is uh solved b by you project the pas project
uh uh i make a tick here and i clean up this is just to to solve that pro that problem regarding the slide and the slide resolution
so we remove uh that part
and we call that the pas
and in that case we use um a frame grabber here
and we go with the slide here
and um of course these two cards will be on the same machine
and uh we have to develop a solution here
the main critical point is here
the synchronisation between these two uh these two cards
and with that this is the card that we use in the smart meeting room and this is uh the card the um
so the c you have bought this card right
i mean you say this is a card
yeah these one no no
th uh this one is and this one the video card
no no
and this one this is uh the card that we have already at idiap for the sli
mm-hmm
yeah
but i mean this one is the i. v. c.
hmm
i it's the same as as you have in the picture yeah
yeah yeah
okay
so what i want to say is on this card there are four inputs right
yep
yeah
okay
yeah
not n so enough uh well yeah yeah
so
i was thinking to some extent nothing would would prevent us uh from also acquiring the slide but really the slide stream from from this card indeed
right
or
okay
yeah yeah
yeah
so we can have both
we can have the slide from the slide capture and we can just use uh a video signal to to capture that also
yeah
okay
to capture the slide
yeah
okay
to have two t uh mm you wants to ha do you have two quality h high quality and
well
i mean just because we cannot rec uh we can w something we cannot do with uh it seems for with the high q quality uh capture uh device is to have a stream
i mean the stream
right the full stream
yeah we can just take some snapshots
so we can tape snapshots
yeah
so basically it might be interesting to have still um uh the s uh the slide stream so that for instance if we detect there is a new video that is displayed also on
to some extent we could just cut this videos to keep it and to be able to replay it uh later on and so on
yeah
yeah
yeah
yeah
and maybe indeed if for instance the slide stream on the on the right is automatically synchronized with the other parts of the video
yeah
it may be easier to s to uh synchronize directly by some some matching process
the slides the high quality measures we have here we've directly yeah yeah
yeah
with um this one
so yeah you won't yeah
yeah
so you you would you c you can uh link like this
yeah
yeah
something like like say something like that
yeah exactly
mm-hmm mm-hmm
yeah
yeah
yep
so at least uh this is not at the electronic level
but you would say as a contents from the content level
doing an alignment from the slide stream and from the snap shots we would have on the other side w is something that might be possible
yeah
of course if we have some you know some constraints given by the electronic i mean it's that's better
uh because of course first the process is going to be easier and it may be just a few signals that we have to align on the other parts
yep
but i think i could see i could imagine that this could be a reasonable process to do
and it especially because this would solve some of the issues regarding i mean like the possibility of d of displaying videos after from from what we record
yeah yeah
ch yeah
video
yeah
yeah
yep
mm-hmm
definitely
so yeah
okay
so uh i was just talking about the pas project
maybe i would like just now to talk about the diva project
so i clean up
yeah
i
there
um did you read something regarding the diva project
well this is more or less what we just discussed right if i understand
in fa yeah uh we just remember that here we we still have only one machine to do uh the slide video and audio acquisition
mm-hmm
and the diva it was uh something different
fact we have a master machine that's um
we have a master machine here
and we have some slaves machine here
we have some connection and here we have some input
we have audio
usually we have audio
and
and the same for this one
and um basically on the slave machine we have two cards one for audio and one for video
so they develop something to synchronize these two cards together and th uh this is something which is it's more w which is call uh direct show
uh which allows you to to synchronize uh these two cards together
and but of course you want these two streams to be synchronize
but you want also these two streams to be synchronized
so they have a synchronization between two slaves which is done by the master
here we just use uh the et ethernet network to synchronize uh these two um these two device
mm-hmm
um i just write
internet something like that
and uh they do only audio and video
uh they don't do any slide
um
slide acquisition yeah
acquisition
mm-hmm
okay
so yves asked for the diva
i would like just to talk now regarding uh the the fire free smart meeting room at idiap
do you have any question
tape free
or uh
tape free
what yeah tape free sorry
tape free
d. v. tape free
tape free smart meeting room
so for that i
so like the diva project is a tape free already smart meeting room huh
yes
yeah
it's yeah
it's a tape free but also video
uh and the acquisition is done in raw video
so the file is huge and they really need uh um they have a long post processing to convert raw file to uh divx or to our own files
mm-hmm
okay
but this can be done automatically right
i mean is the okay
yeah but it takes time
it it's just just to mention that
uh so
i will write
and that's what you they use more or less in t. n. o. also
they didn't have uh tapes
but with different cards
yeah
so at t. n. o. they have something
yeah yeah
they had something
ah okay
okay
okay
for the ami project
so maybe first i will just describe the ma the smart meeting room that we have at idiap
yeah okay
no
no that's what i was thinking
in fact we have uh also a master slave architecture
hmm
um i clean a little bit
we have the master p. c. which take ks uh which takes care about the audio
i clean that
and we have the slave p. c. which take cares about the white board and the slides
now if we look at the video
if we look at the video in fact um yeah maybe first i should mention that
between the master and the slave we have um the mm a synchronization signal which is call time midi time code
yeah
i just write midi
and for the video we have the video input here
we re use the um midi signal
uh with um to insert the time code on each frame
and we save that to d. v. recorder
uh i i have video
okay
mm-hmm
uh we know the problem of that that uh this is that after each meeting somebody has to take care about the d. v. tapes and to t convert them into divx
so my idea is to d do something like that is to develop a s um
um uh a video slave machine
may i say something like that yeah a video slave machine uh which use the midi um which use also the midi time code
mm-hmm
no sorry
sorry i'm doing something wrong
we have the video here
we just have the time code inserter
so we take that signal here and we move to this uh machine here which is in fact just uh the i. v. c. video card
this just an acquisition card
mm-hmm
and we com and we s and we convert file directly to divx
and um so we will have here video
and also because we want to control that machine we use also the midi time code the midi time code to start and to stop the machine
this is just something uh that uh this just to remove the d. v. recordings
but um yeah
just uh this just an improvement of the smart meeting room
okay
uh do you have any question uh regarding uh that
yeah so currently because there is a time code uh video time code
you don't care about the frame dropping i mean because anyway in each in the video signal it is encoded the time right
yeah
we don't have to care about the synchronization in that case because the time code is ins serted here
and we take after the time code insertion we take the video signal and we pass through the machine
yeah
yeah
yeah yeah
yeah
mm
so uh this is uh a simple solution but um where we don't have to care about the synchronization
okay
because the synchronization problem comes from the the grabbing from the d. v. tape in in d in d. vix
co yeah
the synchronization is yeah
so it's afterwards
well but you don't i mean at this point you don't really care because
i mean in the signal you can extract the time
i mean the time stamp is i in the signal
mm
so if you drop some frame
which happens sometimes when you do compression or acquisition uh you you uh ev you will automatically find this in uh the signal right
yeah
i mean it's encoded in the in the image
so you can you can do it
yeah
otherwise uh if there is some frame dropping you have to rely on the number of frames you are counting more or less i suppose to to assess it
yeah
oh no it's impossible yeah
uh so you have you have some problems then yeah
okay
okay
so the f last one is uh the fire wire acquisition
uh i just
which i which was more or less t. n. o.
s problem
okay
with respect to frame dropping right
mm they didn't have too much fun grabbing
the problem is was that it was not synchronized
so the time code was wrong for for the different videos
they had the uh uh at the beginning of the video you if you saw the time code it was six hours ni uh fifty minutes
and h there four hours thirty two minutes
yeah
so it's it was a problem with the time code
well i think if it was not a problem of frame dropping the alignment would have been quite easy to to do
well that's what they did uh manually after the afterwards
and the
but they didn't have too much frame drops in fact
no they d yeah yeah yeah i'm sure
really
well so it was not such a difficult process then
because
well it's manual to to synchronize it the frame
yeah but if it's only to find uh one of set you have to find some exa some examples
yeah that's what they did
but i i had the feeling that they had also some frame dropping that was uh no
no no because uh we did the software here and it they didn't choo no our uh software
okay
okay
then that's fine
okay
um in fact the the major problem regarding acquisition system is always the synchronization
and for that fire wire is good
i mean fire wire was a project
now the project is uh stand by
uh we don't move to that project
i am but i am just going to talk about this one
um so with acquisition with acquisition systems uh the major problem the major problem is uh the synchronization
and fire wire gives you some um some way to be synchronize in fact
uh this is uh i just want to to describe here the bus
this uh yeah this is of the bus where you can send you can send some package
and any device we which wants to send a package a p a packet sorry should ask um there is a manager of that bus
packet
this just of the bus
any device which wants to send a packet has to r to r
uh require some uh band width on the bus on the bus
and so after that he will have that band width
and he will always have that band width
so um yeah he will always have that band width
and so we are sure that we will have a synchronize acquisition with fire wire
and so so that mean that um
and this is no no no
yeah
yeah
sorry sorry
uh yeah
and this is done at the um you have libraries
hardware
et et cetera to to choo well uh a all you you are saying about uh asking about band width et cetera
it th when y uh you use a system um hardware
it's i it's done by it's done by hardware
yeah yeah
it's done by hardware
so we don't have to code all the communication process et cetera
no no no no no
and in fact yeah
hmm
so just for explanation
i i as i mentioned before we have a bus manager and the bus manager send just a flag to say now it's time to give me you data
and all devices which have uh required some band width will send the data
so i'm just drawing something like that
this is this kind of signal that the th bus manager is sending
and just after that bus just after that uh signal all device will send uh the data
so we will have the data from a. from b. and from c. and so on
and after the next one we will have again the um
the data from a. b. and c. and so on and so on
and so with fire wire we are sure to have a um an acquisition system
now the major problem with fire wire is that that fire wire is just an kind of intelligent uh a smart pipe
a synchronized pipe
we can put what we want inside
so we can put raw data or we can send a divx data
or we can send also uh what i uh was presenting in my term presentation was a h. two six four
but in that case we need something uh hardware here to uncode raw data to a given format
of course uh the idea is to reduce um the band width on the bus also
and all data are sent through the master
do you have any quest
mm yeah
now basically we have all this kind of general view about all the systems maybe we can take this opportunity to come back to our system
because you know we had there are mm we had the long discussion and finally we decided for for one approach
yeah
mm-hmm
and maybe take the opportunity to look just a moment uh at what point we are and w when we plan basically to get something uh done and working
i can add to that list of project is something that jean marc and me we have found in the literature
there is f. x. that is doing something very similar to to what we do here basically
yes
a capture through the projector signal of the slides and they for the moment they just plan to use the slides as a as a way to index the presentations
but but uh roughly is is an idea that is very similar to to our idea
so well essentially now we have the material as far i'm as i'm understood
uh and it's up to you to tell us roughly when do you think uh we're gonna have something working
okay
yeah
so we need uh well this is will be done together t like in to to try to divide the time uh what do we do
um we we don't want today to to put deadlines you know
mm-hmm
but um what we have what we can do and how we will be able to do
i was thinking uh for instance uh in th in what we have um uh because i don't know a lot about um using uh like uh d. l. l.
m. f. c. uh uh microsoft software
but i'm very happy to to go with that
and uh so what we have until now is the software that darren did for the frame grabbing
mm-hmm
and and actually i c um i can start playing and uh looking at the this uh in detail
mm-hmm
so darren software
about um frame grabbing
sup i suppose m. f. c. c. no uh not m. f. c. c. but m. e m. f. c.
you heard of that
mm-hmm
and uh d. l. l. et cetera
the all the windows uh uh pro programming
issues yeah
um so this is one uh step
then um the audio video card um so so uh first uh we need to look at this
to look at the demos that are uh i with the what they call the s. d. k. uh software development kit
yeah
uh demos test
um testing the card with uh only one audio for instance and then only one video
mm-hmm
and e even uh testing with only the slides uh to capture all the uh like what you were saying the the s uh the video s uh stream
yeah
well slide stream
uh in fact the um slide card l sorry
the slide card and the video card are both s. d. k.
the frame
so what
you mean the frame grabbing card
yeah
yeah
both are s. d. k.
they have s. d. k. uh software development kit that is based on uh m. f. c. libraries and c. plus plus libraries
yeah
yeah y yeah
yeah this for that you uh i don't remember by how
okay
no
okay
but
so once you we've tested the individually the card we can test to synchronize the audio and the video together
or is it no it's synchronized
usually audio audio and video should be synchronized
or okay
because uh this just an on an audio video channel
okay
so uh they are synchronize
um so we can play with the video
we can play with the slide
uh and after that and the major point is to m combine both
okay
and the i th now we are
as you said uh what not now but uh the next point would be to use that card with the other card and to merge the slide signal with the
yep
well um the s uh yeah the synchronization signal coming from the frame grabbing card
it's uh it's it's not a synchronization signal it's a slide with a t
we we don't have synchronization
oui oui
yeah we will
we have to find a solution and for that might be we can use uh direct show
which is a syn which is a technique to synchronize different device
and is is it external to this card
it's external
no no
or it's i
this is just uh an application which i
so it's external
it's not in this uh card
no no no no no
no
this not on the card
this just an application that runs on the machine
and we don't have to buy that
or well uh to to uh at least the basic
um f i think direct show you can download for free
i'm i'm not sure
m i should check
okay
and that will will uh will be will help us to synchronize the this frame grabbing card and this video card
or
yeah it m yeah
so uh t yeah we need to do some tests
reading and yeah
okay
and then when we have okay
where do we do that
he we don't know yet with frank if we install this card maybe here
i think the best thing to do is to have a machine just which is only dedicated to to that
because uh if you if you if you if you use a machine which has been already used for something else sometimes you have plenty of libraries
okay and at idiap it's possible there
and so you you don't know exactly
okay
maybe it would be better to have just a dedicated machine just for that
mm careful because the uh i listened to frank and apparently don't want to buy a new machine before we show that this works
mm-hmm
just for
okay
so we have to use material that is already available
okay
yeah but maybe there are already some machines you know uh uh
maybe there is some free ma machine that is not
well on my machine his machine or this machine maybe
uh
okay s so it is possible to use other machines actually yeah
mm
yeah i mean just that you know if of course you don't want to have a c other libraries that may
you know conflict with the one you are trying to use
mm-hmm
at the same time yo see if you crash a machine i mean because you are doing some test
you may not want to have what's on your machine i mean to uh to be to be uh de erased or whats whatever
yeah
yeah
yeah
okay
so i think it's so maybe there is a machine i don't know whether for this you need you know a very powerful machine and so on
issue
mm
but maybe there is a possibility to use a current machine which is only u yeah that's is withdrawn from the network or yeah
yeah yeah
some of uh some other machine yeah
i i oui
because
because i think um the video is done the video compression is done on the on that card and uh i'm not hundred percent sure
the card
mm-hmm
but i think the j. peg the j. peg conversion for the slide capture is done also on the card
so we don't need
yeah
but still i mean even if it's done on the card you need to basic thing you need to check is um is a bus right
i mean the bus writing i mean the speed of uh the bus
ah yeah
yeah
but i mean yeah
i was just thinking about the the speed of the computer could be lower
yeah yeah
yeah yeah yeah
so c. p. u. itself may not be so
the access yeah
so mm in terms of time what we can think
so yeah
uh uh mm
when we can expect to see
so can we expect a christmas uh gift
yeah christmas two seven
uh
christmas gift or
early new year gift
no no
uh
um yeah that's good question
maybe a first so solution will be just to start w with
because we need to start with something
we have the slide capture from darren
we have um i will work on the video acquisition for the inpu the tape free smart meeting room
mm
so i will start with that to develop some knowledge regarding that board uh that video board and after that we can combine both
but the way of course i'm i i don't know exactly what uh the work involves
yeah alexandre did not care too much about the way uh you i no no no but uh you are more in research
so is this uh no that's not that i don't care
but uh i d i don't understand some way exactly
i think the the the real point is when
mm-hmm
okay i said at the beginning of the meeting that mm uh well we're not d doing deadlines
roughly
i mean i i don't say well no no no
but uh yeah
i don't wanna put a deadline
mm yeah
uh but uh given the current uh material we have um mm given your activities because i know that you both are involve in many other things
no no
yeah yeah yeah
mm-hmm
mm-hmm
mm-hmm
so it's something that you yeah as jean marc said is christmas and uh so we're happy with the christmas gift
or is something that you say is christmas two thousand six
so i i i definitely just want to know something very rough on when you expect to finish this
for instance i mean the test of looking at their entry goes point by point
yeah
so looking at their code i mean uh so you said you would look at this right
or is it okay
ye well we would look both at
because we are also both uh quite busy with other projects of course
uh e h. f. e. s. database uh with j. ferret uh
that's problem
uh that's that's a problem
i mean do you think it's something for the very next months
do you think it's something for the end of next year
do you think sp
okay this is between both
no
for not for no no
this not for end of next year
it's too long
yeah of course yeah
mm
and it it's uh it's too long it's too long
so is for so half next year
so june june june two thousand six
for myself i would like to say uh april may
april may we should have results
re results what does it mean
the end of this
so it works it doesn't work
uh no no no
uh i mean the um
uh not al almost uh the uh the the uh the complete application
ready to be used
maybe some minor will appears
you know for for me what is important is when it is ready to be use
yeah
so when i can say start collecting data uh i start using
so uh
data
i start playing with this
basically the process is ready and we can start having our demo
and also because there is a risk that uh we submitted a project maybe it will be rejected we don't know
but potentially we are going to have a student supposed to work in this
it will be no not before april two thousand six anyway
mm-hmm
but uh you know mm some way we we we we cannot have a students and make him wait one year before he has uh the material to work
yeah we yeah
yeah
yeah
mm-hmm
yeah
so my point is when
'kay
reasonably
uh roughly i don't don't don't wanna have and it's not a deadlines oui
mm-hmm
well uh
but when do you expect to have the system ready to work uh working
mm-hmm
because i mean i mean the i. v. c. system
yep
i mean it's uh i so my feeling is that i mean people have expertise in this like in fribourg also
yeah yeah
so i mean i don't think it should take a lot of time i mean just to look at this right
uh they have
i mean at least one month seems to be uh quite enough for this right
yeah th it's a yeah
but we start with the i. v. c.
we start with the data path
uh the the slide frame grabber
yeah
yeah
and after that is and the question is how to synchroni to to to make both card working together
mm-hmm
together
so this seems to be the main problem as far as as i understand
yeah
yeah
so yeah
let's see
from fro for checking darren's code et cetera we can expect until uh
and yeah for o one months or so then uh the uh the i uh i. v. c. uh w with the people at fribourg have uh yeah
yeah
uh i. v. c. i. v. c. should go faster
okay so uh at fribourg we we have
yeah
because anyway this is what you are working on right
is the i. v. c. but using the signals that are coming i mean so basically it's using the i. v. c. okay
yeah
i will uh i'm not currently working on it
i will start to work on january on that point
mm-hmm
so uh but i think
okay
and then the direct show
mm-hmm
okay so currently you are not working on this
or yeah
no no
i'm not working
okay then we need
i schedule to to work on that from m
so we can say we try to to make something for april
yeah
but i have also a que
uh make something re that you are using very vague expression
but uh well i i want this to to work in the for the time uh in the mm-hmm
result make something
just just uh just tell me when it is ready
mayb
mm
and if you think it's it's not before uh but but must be reasonable i m i mean if you think it will be not before december two thousand six
mm
say december two thousand six
so don't try to tell me march or april i w if you already know that it is unrealistic to say that
mm-hmm
must be realistic
you say june two thousand six we know it is june two thousand six
but i would like to say uh there is many unknown in that project
uh i know
uh i mm-hmm
but i would like to say we can make uh uh a schedule of that project to just to track to just to see if we track the time table
the
sure
sure
mm-hmm
but
mm-hmm
if we don't we we asks for more people maybe h. e. v. s. people
mm-hmm
mm-hmm
to to to be slightly involved in that project to be to to respect the date
o one student or yeah
yeah
well but there is no day to respect
it's just to know i mean and if you can have early early warnings in the sense that if you see that there is a major uh problem somewhere
yeah
n
mm-hmm
but is just to know in the sense that really uh this p this mm thing has been stop now for quite a long time
yeah
mm-hmm
uh uh it n it took a long time to decide what kind of material
now we have it
it's something that uh is a pretty good idea
we see that other people are working et cetera
we are going to lose it some way if uh if we don't put some and very honestly yeah
yeah that that's that's so that's one of the issue i mean that uh maybe don't know w whether you realise
and we can ask help uh
mm-hmm
but of course if we have this in two years maybe okay it's good we have it
but of course it's it's on the it's too long i mean in terms of in term of research
i it's too late in terms of research uh mm
it's too long
i i it'll it'll not be
in terms uh maybe even in terms of innovation i mean if you think about this which is you know what uh they said
mm-hmm
no
i mean he was speaking about innovation
mm-hmm
this is probably one an innovation
this is innovation yeah
yeah
and the the i know i'm we we see quite well why is working on this right
mm
but in two years you know if we want to do if we want to build a c. t. i. or transfer technology and something like this
you know maybe you c of course okay people will say yeah
but there is already something that people have started to put on the market and so on
yeah yeah
yeah
so it maybe not the it's it's too late uh to to do it
so i think this is really so this is one of the points respect to research of course
it's i think it's going to appear more more and more and uh
uh you know in a sense i never tried for example eventually to ask for one person dedicated to this because i always had the feeling that you are very interested
hmm
you wanted to do it it's something you some way you uh i mean it seems to be something that is interesting to you
mm-hmm
mm-hmm
but uh if you have not the time and the possibility to do it because you you both are involved in many other things
mm-hmm
we can eventually try to ask to have one person to involve one person that will be dedicated strictly to this
hmm
we can try
i mean we can ask uh uh in the sense that if it is a priority for idiap so far we would get very good signals from that point of view
yeah
mm-hmm
i i don't know
but uh please if you think you don't have the time or the energy to do it
mm-hmm
uh or it involves too many things that you cannot keep under control given the other things you have to do
uh don't think that okay something nice we we can wait or sooner or later it will happen
no no no no
we understand that you we cannot wait uh we were here one year ago uh i don't know
uh yeah
and also when it's was uh going uh the idea was appearing and
exactly
so i think it's the moment uh for you to really realise try to to have a realistic uh date
mm-hmm
and if you think there are too many things that you risk to lose control uh tell it now
and we can try to say well we want to do it but uh basically mael and olivier were the person mm-hmm
mm-hmm
mm-hmm
mm-hmm
mm
okay
personally i want to be involve in that project
a acquisi uh some mm
no no
but but you can be involve in a different way
i mean you can eventually have uh a supervision role in the sense that you think that i i know how to do it
mm
i like to do it but i have no time
mm-hmm
because at a certain point it's a matter of time
mm-hmm
mm-hmm
we can try to to ask
uh but uh please just don't keep this as a kind of thing
yeah i like to do it i like it it's nice et cetera
yeah yeah
yeah
yeah
because when when you say here now no i'm not going to start to working on this before january
for me this surprises me to some extent you know i'm uh i thought i mean you would you would be working on this
yeah
so if you say okay now it's uh yeah
yeah
but uh at the same time i have some other project i i want to finish uh those project first
yeah bu but but here you have to take a responsibility
you can't say i like to do it and but then ah but i will do it when i can
no uh oui
no
i mean the point is that olivier will r you have i mean s since one year uh you have always been saying that you want to be involved in this and so on
mm
so it seems that it has never been a priority
so that that's uh that's the point
exactly
so if you have no time to put priority at some points and this seems to have been the case during one year on this project
i mean you need to say it now
i mean that's the point now
but for example i have uh i receive some new project
mm
i said that i have no time yet
i say i have no time gi now currently i um i say some for some project you say that you don't have time
mm-hmm
uh yeah yeah yeah
mm-hmm
okay this is yeah
but people will stay will continue to say no no you will find time just to do that project
no no
okay so now is your responsibility to say i cannot find time
mm-hmm
the
so this is franck
if you can't find time you have to say it now
and this is also for you
at least uh say this to us and we'll see uh with franck
hmm
i mean i it's not an accusation
we we are all in the same condition
and again i mean this is a question
so now you are saying you have no time
so now you say to us
so now we understand and we are maybe after
when we if we discuss with franck uh franck crittin or uh uh frank uh formaz and we'll see okay and go and try to see
mm-hmm
okay apparently uh he has no time to to work on this
so we think it's important and we'd like to to do something
so what kind of solution as alexandre mentions i do we need to take somebody
exactly
do we want to do we need to take some intern to work on this uh and so on and so on
mm-hmm
do we take to have uh somebody uh for contract even if it's not an intern but take somebody for six months to work on this
mm-hmm
mm-hmm
i mean but so this a point
i mean uh y i don't know about the other projects you have to do
i don't know with who you are discussing about the time you are you can s uh s spend on each of the project
mm-hmm
mm-hmm
but if y because now you are just telling us you have no time indeed to work on this right
yeah
okay so so okay
mm-hmm
s s
currently but uh up to december i don't have time to work on it
yeah but i mean c it's yeah but
but i plan already
i i um with i. m. two i i i did uh i mention that i will have from january two thousand six i will have time for that
with i. m. two i. p. one
mm-hmm
uh i have a
fifty percent on on i. m. two that's it
no i will work fully on that on this point
from january two thousand six i wi
it's fifty percent no
on i. m. two i. p. one
okay maybe in fifty percent uh on that
so let me pose the question very broadly
do you think that we have a person that has this will help you
mm-hmm
we can ask we can try to ask maybe if some person for six months so that your role is simply to help and advise
mm-hmm
we can try to ask
why this was yeah mo yeah w i don't want to talk too much maybe
uh but uh with sebastien sorry this was maybe uh his concern
and yeah bastien is busy with uh annotations plus all kind of things
uh maybe we can in the process we can ask for
i mean
someone more
maybe a good thing will be to make a plan to to we say we we won't set the deadline here
to work on that
well uh uh that's what i i was
s
we are here
we split that part in different segments
y
that's what i was trying to do and i before coming here i just tried to to make uh uh a plan
uh y
i'm sorry but you still don't answer to my my question
but i don't answer yeah
you are not answering my question
w well the let's say uh april o. six and uh we do uh our best with uh trying to keep you inform with the advancements
yeah
yeah
and if we see early that clearly uh there i
let me pose again the question very clearly
if i go to herve i can try and say we are in this situation apparently
mm-hmm
why don't we take one person three months six months four months that directly advised by olivier and uh and we can speed up
and it should be someone with experience in c. plus plus m. f. c.
uh
consider that it can be difficult of course to find them et cetera and so on
yeah
well i mean uh i mean you have people that are aware of uh m. f. c.
or a student
do you think it's an option
mm-hmm
i mean i mean people uh i suppose at h. u. v. there are some people uh where i was in le mans in the u. b. uh i mean there uh would be obviously some some students uh that would be aware of and that could be able to handle this
mm-hmm
at each
yeah i think there are people yeah
yeah the yeah
mm-hmm
i mean they are working with software and hard both our software and hardware
mm-hmm
mm-hmm
do you think it's a reasonable option
uh i'm i'm sure the s se
do you think it's something that uh can help you
because that's just a matter of responsibility for you guys to but there is nothing bad if you say you have other things to do
because we are all uh full of work
this is something that is added on the top
mm-hmm
uh if you don't have time you don't have time guys
i mean this is uh but please just tell me
we will find the time however
so april o. six you will have your system
or no we are not sure
we don't really know
uh it can happen that we don't
we don't know what you are going to find on the way
maybe we think it takes one week and then it takes one month
uh w we don't know
mm-hmm
uh maybe we will s we wi will not able to be continuous
because one of the wrongest thing is to work one week then one month no et cetera
mm-hmm
mm-hmm
that's it's something that breaks
i mean difficult huh
mm so that's the point
so that which doesn't mean you are excluded f from the thing in the sense that in any case someone will ask will have to advise the person eventually
no no no
mm-hmm
and it can't be him it can't be me
it can be you that basically follow advise helps
but at least the mass of the work will be done by someone else that can spend a hundred percent of time on that
now it's not even guaranteed in the sense that i can ask this
mm-hmm
i can say that well this is the situation and uh you are
hmm
or eventually yeah someone can say okay now this become your priority
forget about everything else and go with that
i don't know
or will tell you okay uh january two thousand six but from january two thousand six you do nothing else than this
you know w we can find the time whether it is your time whether it is the time of someone else
no
but uh i really would like to stop with this because this has been for several months that you say we like we want
and i'm sure i believe you
but then it is always something that must be done outside uh the uh normal activity
no no no
yeah
yeah
which is really bad
yeah
i i understand exactly
um i'm uh i'm sorry
yeah yeah yeah
yeah
but but uh otherwise i mean as you say to do it in two years p
no i understand
mm-hmm
yeah
yeah yeah
so what do you think
what
you like that i try to to to solve this problem and try to say that there is a time problem and you don't have the time to do it
because uh so so olivier says it's not before january on his side
so i'm not sure about uh on your side whe what's your yeah
well i would like to to to work on p kind of part time uh uh w o yeah
like what
one day a week uh something like this
yeah
and one full day a week
and i would okay
maybe you won't like my answer but i would say that um we ch we we start but we h we really have to start on working wi uh reading all the code from darren
then this um card with the code i. v. c. card and to to try this
then we try a little bit direct show to see um uh to to have an idea of how how long uh that could be
and then at the moment we can say okay we need someone to help us
okay
but that can be
yeah
but i think yeah that will be good just to have a plan and to have some deadline in that plan
but
but uh
and as soon as we we we as soon as we we we are not in time we we we con
well w uh let's do that
let's do that
okay
fo
because uh because there are there are several issues i would say
like if there would be a machine like this with the two cards separated as i mention
i mean if we record le the flow of the video for instance and the snap shots from the slides to some extent there is some possibility of doing some automatic alignment without having a special
you know
synchron so this means that to some extent we could have a device which would not yet be fully synchronized and
i don't know we've uh you know very well done uh code in terms of sending signals and so on
but that might be sufficient because i mean it synchronize up to don't know five seconds
yeah
yeah
yeah
and you would say five seconds may seem a lot for audio and video
but maybe f respect to slides and the rest is not is something that may be tolerable
it can be tolerable yeah
yeah
so still we would be able to start doing some recordings and maybe uh doing even the automatic alignment or at least we would have an idea about
exactly
you know what are the problems in terms of alignments
uh do do because it's not like with microphone arrays where you would need micro second alignments of course
yeah
uh or even maybe with we want video where it may be one or two frames i don't know
so this is really some somehow i mean the uh the the issue i mean i'm sure that there are plenty of possibilities to do things
it's a very good idea yeah
and the goal would be that indeed we could start uh rec doing some of the recordings of the time so that indeed we would already we uh we would have uh something where uh we could uh start getting the data
yeah and to improve the system like
mm-hmm
mm-hmm
because after i mean even if it there we cannot put all the times in one week right
i mean so and uh so i mean this is uh this is one of the issue as well
yeah
mm-hmm
which is to have it so that we can play and we can make a nice demo and so on with the full uh thing and something
mm-hmm
so f the other part is to have a system which from which we can already record data and with some approximation
and i have the feeling given the descriptions that you made
yeah
that to have such a system wouldn't require a six months of work because basically their own code is there to some extent and uh the i. v. c. is something quite standard from which we could ask i mean even we could even pay maybe pro some people from fribourg
i don't know
i mean to come here and to and to help us with the installation on a computer and uh and uh to to to get the so i have more the feeling that this is something that could be done almost in one month
yeah
mm-hmm
mm-hmm yeah
to
again i'm not speaking about the synchronization i mean as
so without direct show you mean the frame grabbing signal and time alignment
yep
yeah i mean the two yeah yeah
uh wi that would be done uh in like in common software that we have uh afterwards
yeah
and we
yeah the for instance a simple question maybe you can are we sure that it can work on a single computer
i don't know
i don't know
i mean is there any uh issues with respect to this
okay th and this point is about testing and uh yeah
uh i no
so this is yeah
okay
let me
so it doesn't require it it's more testing it does not require so for this we i mean if you put the two cards on the computer
you put the two then you you basically you say play on the both sides and you look whether at the end you have uh a recorded signals which is is is uh the time that it should uh be and uh or whether i mean the fact that whenever i mean the slides is doing some uh processing uh it there is some and there is some frame drops or things like this
yeah
yeah
so you could say okay let's for christmas let's try this without the all the synchronization
so this is uh
uh with direct show issue
okay oh yeah you are you cannot or o l uh by doing one one day a week mm you know just i think the cards
yeah
that seems to me clear
until january is uh is busy
yeah
uh if i if i say until january this is just to finish
so
uh i want to have the deadline at end of december to finish all my project
i want to finish all these project when everything is finished
okay
ah
so yeah
just to go to a conclusion because apparently yeah
after that i can move to another one
mm-hmm
but i don't want to
so it can't work uh yeah exactly
anyway the recording is finished i think
yeah
can't work uh until january
yeah
no
no
so i try my best until january
so it's up to you
it's up to you to evaluate yeah
and um and i try to do what jean marc uh described to give you a first feedback on the different cards
mm-hmm
uh and uh and from there it would m yeah
and then we d make a decision in the sense whether you continue working or we try to find the time in a different way or we try to eliminate your other priorities you're under
yeah
yeah
mm-hmm
hmm
i'm i'm wondering whether still we could ask for to get an intern for this
yep
uh i i don't know regarding h. e. v. s.
i mean uh
i don't know if this is uh still in time
but you can have you can ask for a student a d a diploma work
yeah this is uh still uh even even the non diploma work
i mean the things we could ask uh but i would yeah
i think that's that's a different problem
the problem is really up to you guys whether you think it's good to have one person
yeah
try to have that because uh i cannot say we have tried to have
i would say uh let's let's yeah let's try to have one uh students uh to help us on that
yeah
i don't know
mm
that is very well we have to choose whether the students it's too it'd be stupid
well you
w exactly it wi but better no person than a bad person anyway
yeah that's that's the issue
but uh uh the the student should have knowledge about m. f. c. with oh okay
yeah
well but yeah
yeah
yeah
yeah
mm-hmm
okay
okay
doesn't mean that we d we have to to stop talking yet
i think it's
but uh the recording has finished
uh
okay we start waiting for people coming late and uh i can say this because in this moment you cannot answer because you don't have the microphone
thanks
yeah
yeah sorry about that matthew is still on the way
so i can say whatever and you cannot reply
yeah
so yeah
okay hang on reply coming
yeah it's okay
u oh i hate these things
voila
okay
so
um we can maybe get a head start
um have you been talking to matthew about what you've been doing
or
um a little bit but uh i'm m i'm not sure he knows uh everything
so uh basically uh well
first we tried to um explain why in this uh resc uh n. best list re scoring uh from the slides to enhance the speech recognition on the meetings data is not working
yeah
yeah yeah
so um uh that's one thing
and uh so what we did with alessandro is uh um ch t uh performing some statistical tests to see whatever r if the if the words uh the the appearance of the words during the meeting is uh in independent of the ap appearances of the different slides
yeah
so the in the case if it is dependent that would mean that certain words tend to appear during certain slides and that there is a correlation and uh then there will be uh a reason like for believing that uh this will work
yeah which was the intuitive feeling
yeah
yeah
and is and the r result was no
the resu the result was no
but uh bu but the question is if is that result no because it's no or is it also just because there's not really enough data to be sure about anything
ye
in my opinion it is no because of the nature of the language
i mean intuitively of course you tend to use more the words that are on the slide
sure
but the mass of the words actually you use are words that are common
yeah okay
just think that fifty percent of the words on average whatever corpus you take are stop words articles et cetera
yeah
yeah
so in terms of recognition fifty percent goes away
yeah
of the rest uh remaining fifty percent i mean are all words that appear one two three times
it's not gonna yeah
so in any case even if actually and they tend to be uh related or a statistically related to a single slide in any case in terms of uh recognition do not help at all or help a very little
yeah
so uh that's the kind of thing uh i mean that's the kind of measure the ind statistical independence is not on single words
yeah yeah
this is so sort of a feeling that we had but hadn't shown
i think i mean i in uh from uh from an application point of view it might be interesting to make sure that your vocabulary contains all the words on the slides
hmm
but from a research perspective it's not interesting
you know
even if actually i remember i just made some measure uh saying okay l let's look at how many words i don't have in the dictionary and are in the slides
there'd be very few
yeah true
it was two percent
yeah almost nothing
well this is h this is how the dictionary's calculated
it calculated such that if you don't have the word it doesn't affect to a great degree the the the word error rate
yeah
mm-hmm
exactly
exactly
so
exactly
so some in some sense it intuitively it sounds very good
mm-hmm
but in practical terms in terms of recognition uh here we we we have to be clear
if you want to improve the recognition that im improves very slightly
yeah
sure
yep
uh it is different if you want to have other tasks where the only words that all are words
m like yeah
yeah
in that case even the slight improvements uh he gets at that point they can make the difference
yeah
but th yeah
but does the recognition
no
well this is yeah
that's yeah
and some way the statistical independence i think it can be a good explanation to show why it is happen even if it is counterintuitive
yeah
but that's that's what happens basically
huh
so matthew we were uh yeah
could you ju just quickly rewind
yeah
it's uh we were talking that we did some experiments to see if the word during meeting the words appear independently of the slides in a sense that uh if certain words tend to appear during certain slides or no
oh sorry about that
yeah
yeah
okay
oh
okay
and uh the answer is uh no
okay
and uh so we did a statistical test for that
and i will add also that we did that on the uh w the words after filtering them from the removing the the stop words
oh
of course
yeah yeah
yeah so uh so uh bec s because yeah
yep
okay
'cause it's not gonna make any difference
mm-hmm
yep
with the stop words okay th there would be a reason for uh in independence because there is uh such a huge mess of them
but uh even uh after removing them uh there it it remains uh independent
and actually uh so when i was doing the re scoring experiments i was doing that on uh one meeting that i selected as being like the best looking one
uh it ha it had the m the most uh slides
and now i did the same uh on uh the other meetings which were available where well it's only three meetings because well here there are four of them which are from the test set uh from the ami recogniser w but only three of them have uh slides
mm-hmm
yep
so it's total of three meetings and for the others the tendency and i c 'cause you know i was when i was doing re scoring
i was uh taking into account the for one given slide also the n neighbouring slides
and as i was in increasing the number of slides which were affecting the the utterance i was re scoring um the performance was improving sli s uh slightly
mm-hmm
very very little
but uh
no no
wait wait
it's going very fast for me actually
yeah
thing actually
it's very fast
so wha first point the first thing you told me that you took the slides and you was and you had a l big dictionary and you are seeing uh what what are the inside the slide
right
uh what the 'cause i first statement i could not understand
uh the the first thing we are talking about ex the experiment to see the uh if it's dependent or independent
uh when you said the the st uh uh the s uh the w yeah
so we what's so yeah so could you please tell me little bit more in detail
how we did it
yeah
uh so we used the pearson uh chi square uh test no
no no no don't go that
i i want the no
i want to understand what did you mean by the wo uh the te uh thing like saying that i took a dictionary and then a word from the slide and what you are looking for
i could not understand clearly clearly that
ah okay
it was to to see if uh certain words have a tendency to appear during uh uh they if they are more likely to appear during certain slides
mm mm-hmm
okay but do how do why do you want certain words
w
like wha how do you expect that certain words
be be b be careful it's not exactly this because for sure there are words that tend to be
so the point is you want to verify whether you can improve the recognition rate by using as an information the words that uh are contain in the slides
yeah
so basically the idea is that uh in the moment you are in the slide somewhere your language change accordingly to the slide
exactly
so the fact of having that information somewhere can help you to improve the recognition
exactly
but actually it's not what happens
yeah
and this does not happen for many reason
first for example fifty percent of the words in any kind of text are stop words
so are everywhere
yeah
and the remaining a appear so little that in the case cannot really improve that much
most of the words we use actually whatever we talk about are common uh words
okay
so how to verify this
i mean this is something that has been measured et cetera but still is a bit qualitative
to have a quantitative measure mm-hmm we simply did uh a measure of statistical independence between the words in general
mm-hmm
okay
mm-hmm
so not some words the words in general
otherwise you can see that if a words appear once basically it is one hundred percent related to one slide huh
mm
yeah
but you have to i if you want to consider in terms of recognition have to make it overall
hmm
mm-hmm
i mean what is important is not the word that appear once it's the word that appear
yeah
it appears in almost uh uh it is if it appears in all the slides it says a hundred percent correlation for me
if uh i exactly
if if there is one word that appear once all over the meeting
one percent well
yeah
it appears in correspondence of one slide then of course it seems to be very related
yeah
yeah
but very few words uh they represent a very little part of the word mass mm
are like that
mm-hmm
okay
hmm
so we simply used a very old test statistical test
okay
that basically measure the hypothesis that some way the probability of having one word in correspondence of a certain slide is simply the product of the probability of the word for the probability of the
mm-hmm
mm-hmm
okay it's independent of each other
okay
that's it
so that's what we did
okay fine that's fine that's uh uh uh s certain words it should
but is in general the language and not certain words
mm-hmm
because certain words for sure have a strong dependency on the slides
yeah
you have to
okay
but there are l few
yeah
yeah
yeah
hmm
fine
now i'm uh okay
i'm into the loop
yeah
and the answer to that was no
mm-hmm
mm-hmm
and s so when extending the those experiments to the other meetings uh when while i was observing an improvement on the first meeting i was using
uh so i was r observing an improvement as i was increasing um like the um the context
context
yeah
uh
but it is implemented on the a. s. r.
or uh where
on the on the recognition yeah
okay
so there was uh the improvement was also increasing as i was increasing the context
okay
while on the other meetings it's um it's it's it's really fluctuating and uh i it it uh it looks more like um uh ps uh well
what's the word for that
statistical um um fluctuation
fluctuations
oh okay
so uh
i mean the it's probably very dependent on the speaker as well
yeah
some people have a habit of just reading what they've got on their slides and some people are com are are well
else interpolate extrapolate
or or or quite purposefully talk about different things so that they've sort of got multi modality of you know
mm-hmm
yeah
yeah
mm-hmm
uh yeah
but so i mean i guess that's not a surprising result then
the um
yeah
it is not in terms i mean for me for example it was not in the sense that uh after working a little bit on language you realise that this kind of thing do not help simply because most of the words uh have nothing to do specifically with the subject you use
yeah
yeah
uh most of the words we use uh that's strange but are simply necessary to build a sentence
s
yeah
yeah
there are very few uh content uh words
yeah
but it is true that intuitively uh as we are driven in our attention uh i mean in in our understanding we're pretty much driven by attention
that we tend to spot only those words
yeah sure
we s go straight to the semantics of the yep
exactly and in some sense intuitively it seems that it can happen
i mean this is not the first attempt to do things like this and it never works actually i in terms of recognition
hmm
for other task it can be uh it can be uh helpful
yes
maybe
okay
so you mea so uh you mean to say that um like when one case you were saying that if you include the context and all those thing it helps in your a. s. r. improvement
oh okay
but it doesn't which more subjective i think this whole
well i mean uh it just comes down to the to the mere fact that word error rate is just take the words
how many of them did you get right
yeah
take plus or minus two or three or five or ten words doesn't really make any difference
uh-huh
yes
yeah
yeah
huh
so yeah
even if those words at the end of the day would be quite important in any sort of search of the transcript
yep
mm-hmm
mm
exactly
but at the end of the day why wouldn't you just use the slides to search the transcript
mm yeah you can do that yeah
i if you have th slides then yeah
or it could
so that's why um uh if we look on the relationship that uh exists between the speech and the slides uh the task of improving the recognition
uh the overall um sp uh speech recognition using the slides uh seems to be uh uh not very uh um good
no
y you'd ju i mean the uh i mean it so i mean have you been doing other things then
i mean um we cannot expect much from from it
mm
have you have you been thinking about what you would like to to do in in in place of this
or or or leading on from this given what you've learnt
mm well for now the uh most effort was uh on uh um showing why i it's i it's it will not work
especially those experiments and these uh statistical tests
mm-hmm
but uh we w were thinking for example of a task like um trying to uh see if uh where a speaker is talking i mean if the speech is actually correlated with the slides uh where the slides uh which happen during the not correlated
but if the
be careful
correlate is a dangerous word in statistic
'cause ours is strict
yeah
it seems to be the opposite as before
yeah
uh well if the um
associated
if the speaker is actually talking about what is in the slides or not
the
mm-hmm
okay
or roughly
basically uh one thing it can't be done
and and here uh on the contrary for example the few words that are mm how may i say it recognized more can really make the difference
yeah
it isn't the case if you want to see if uh i mean what if seen in the meeting and that okay
there are presentation
then yeah still the slide is there
but actually the people talk about other things
sure
or not really other things but the slide is no longer uh a support for the discussion huh
the focus
yeah okay
there are moment that actually this is the support because the people describe et cetera
and there are moment where it is not
is a just a background uh thing
and we rough estimated very quickly
yep
but it was one third of the time
at least in in the meeting we have seen
the slide were just there i mean but they were no longer use as a support
it was a discussion rather between people
okay
so in that case the presence or the absence and especially the frequence with which you observe the words that are on the slides can be an excellent uh uh clue
indicator
huh
indication a clear indication whether actually does it support of the discussion or not
m meeting action sort of focus
uh it can be this
it can be interpreted as a kind of focus of interest
it can be simply interpreted in the sense of saying uh okay i mean you have this channel open there
yep
do i have to p taken into account or not
hmm
or also in terms of action
yeah uh when you see that s the discussion is completely m disconnected with respect to this some way uh it means that it's happen in something different than before
yeah
yep
so i mean it's a kind of feature that in my opinion can be easy to detect it and um that can
yeah uh f can be interesting to do
yeah
relatively easy to do
and uh in that case for example the few words mm that you that you get more can make the difference
yeah sure
yeah
oh so is that mm double way to to show how some way dependent on the task
so you so you so okay
so maybe like it can be uh something like in a meeting it can be like an unusual scenario for you in a presentation with a slide
w
and the unusual scenario that you're not using the uh slide at all
yeah or for example uh what happened for example in one of the meetings is that p people were um summarizing the the results of the previous meeting
well
yeah
you know
mm-hmm
so in the beginning so the meeting started with the summary of what happened uh previous time and this was not related to what was on the slides
yeah
what are the other slide yeah
ye yeah okay
so i mean uh you could begin with s saying the a um the simple task of just determining whether or not the speech is related to the slide content
and which is sort of building upon what you know dong and others have worked on in terms of
you know is it discussion monologue from the original m. four data collection
uh a y are are you also considering that you could actually look at the relationship between meetings for instance
um well okay
what do you mean exactly
well i mean it if if if these similar sort of phrases or words were discussed in this meeting and were also discussed in the previous meeting
mm-hmm
then you sort of have a a link between meetings for instance
link uh
yeah
some way well there are f yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
i don't know i don't know how this you have to ches the check the statistics
but this is one yeah
but i i mean 'cause obviously you've gotta think towards what you know
yeah
this this won't occupy ab ab you know won't occupy you for three years or whatever just on this i guess
mm-hmm hmm
but have to look at all the future and so just a s
huh
yeah i know this we are s s talking about today short term if you want
yeah yeah
mm-hmm
uh things just to the use the things
i mean all the work they that has done basically which is a huge work
okay
yeah it was recycling uh kind of
and the data we have then uh enough for the for a thesis of course it must be much better
yeah
but of course the there's only two two different kinds of words
some of them you can do it on a single meeting
so this kind of feature extraction because basically that's what it is saying yes no this channel is good
now is background
now is foreground et cetera
you can put it in that in that way
yeah okay
this you do it on a single meeting
and then there are corpus um based um how may i say it works so yeah that is one possibility for example finding the connection between different meetings
yeah
and yep
task
yep
then i don't know
i mean at that point it becomes pretty much crucial the kind of uh data you have in the sense that for the way we have collected the data some way i don't know if it can be at the same time too easy in the sense that some way you have little groups of meetings extremely correlated
yeah
well y yeah
sure
so i mean it it makes it easier
i mean i don't know how much significant can be at that level
yeah
yeah
it can be
i mean uh it's it's and because we don't have all the data collected or annotated yet it's it's very difficult to know isn't it
i in a sense
if you want uh this kind of words become interesting when the corpus is really big uh uh when when you when you consider each meeting as a single item
yeah
yep yep yep
so it's interesting when you have tens hundreds thousands of meetings which is not the case
hmm
but i mean you can do other work if you consider in terms of speaker turns or in terms of slides and that is immediately multiply
yeah sure
or b or as you say back channel versus yeah
yeah
yep yep
that is another
'cause i th think that's quite interesting
huh
i mean 'cause it's an awful lot of speech activity which is yeah
huh
even summarization
or
so it can be one more feature that helps in but it is very short term
i mean just uh well it is ju just few few few times we talk together and it was just
sure
mm-hmm
mm yeah
mean the very quick thing you can can have uh like this
okay
okay
so i mean as far as that you've got everything to do that i presume
um you don't need any extra stuff from us in the immediate future
uh no
or i mean that's good
we have plenty of things to do
that's good
no
but i mean it it
but for the other thing you know uh uh the alternative measures
or maybe we should finish with this first
what track
uh i mean uh
uh yeah i wouldn't get too distracted i guess on d d if you've got two tracks i'd like to
yeah this uh this would be a f uh another subject i would like to discuss
s but uh w but uh uh basically ju just you know if we finish uh discussing this first
yeah
go on
yeah it's no problem
okay
yeah
um
so uh well so ultimately now the next step what is that
because i want like kind of a uh so at first you said that okay now you did this
this correlation studies
and they show that there's a very less correlation or in fact no correlation kind of thing
mm-hmm
mm-hmm
and uh um uh so uh so what next in on top of it what you are going to build i mean is the question now
but i think in a sense in my opinion well there are two things
when this uh statistical test it can be we have made an experiment we get a result somewhat counter intuitive we give an explanation
mm
yeah
yeah
and uh that's it
i mean that's that's something that some way closes here
so when it gives you the kind of answer you get is that okay to go in that in that direction maybe is not the best thing
mm-hmm
maybe to improve the recognition that way is not uh something you can expect
so it gives the possibility to decide to go uh in a different direction that can be more on this uh let's say
yeah so t i mean to the different direction now that's what i mean to say
what you like to take from there
this is not clearly defined yet
uh it's not defined yet okay
this is
hmm
but uh um something um using this relationship uh between the slides uh and other even other tek textual support and the uh and the speech
mm-hmm
hmm
but what kind of problem
we need a definition of some kind of uh problem right
but i
and uh the k and the question is also are there other sort of more sensible ways of doing it
uh yeah
for instance um gaze tracking
yeah
i mean if if people are looking at the slides
mm-hmm hmm
well uh i think the advantage eventually w i mean the advantage with this kind of things is that are much easier
gaze tracking is still
yeah sure
and it has specific to the environment and all that sort of thing
no no no
just with the environment is a difficult thing
yeah
i mean it requires cameras with pretty good quality et cetera
yeah
no but
uh but i think his question is more uh general
yeah
a and it says so i mean based on this work do you figure out uh a direction if they guess correctly
yeah direction
yeah that's that is a thing
uh a domain a direction for your thesis for your exactly
huh
we go on to the next direction
it should not that i it should not happen that you're doing so many things and ultimately it doesn't goes into a thesis
exactly
exactly
exactly
mm-hmm
the that's that should not the problem
exactly
your thesis should be w in one direction
one problem
mm-hmm
and uh should go uh in one or uh one d yeah
one domain yeah
not a collection of little uh things completely unrelated
it it doesn't make sense
but uh
uh the it may be good as a c. v. for you but then as a thesis you will have problems uh defending it and all those things
that's very
mm-hmm
yeah sure
so what is that uh what would be the next possible direction you want to take
uh
well this is um the
question i'm working on
mm
uh but i mean for instance it should be linked to the other stuff that you've been doing on um call routing for instance
and and um you know uh error merit err error measures yes
error measure
i mean i think i mean i i think that it's possible to draw some sort of relationship between the two as we were saying
mm-hmm
i mean maybe if you you don't measure things in terms of word error rate maybe this sort of information does actually mean something
mm-hmm
mm yeah
given that fifty percent of the words are not actually interesting
mm-hmm
yeah
um so i mean
w
yeah that that could be interesting to try to merge those two uh things
well w uh w no it doesn't solve the problem but it's f what is it
m but still doesn't solve the problem of saying what i yeah yeah sure sure
uh yeah
it's yeah
yeah
yeah
what i what you are going to do for your thesis
mm-hmm
i mean as herve said i mean basically if you have to explain in four lines
yeah exactly
what will be the topic of my thesis the subject of my thesis
mm-hmm
and it is something that is not just saying i'm going to do uh this this this and that
yeah
mm
i mean because this we actually don't know
but yeah in a very broad sense i mean w what you're going to investigate what kind of uh
yeah and i um uh
s see that is going to tell us uh something like uh wha the thing is that i uh it it see you can totally go into the text domain and be there
if i interpret correctly
you know
it can be s no problem
but as long as uh it is okay
but if you want to do with uh s like certain something with the speed and all those things together then it's a different scenario
hmm
uh you may not want to work on all the problems
someone may work on some other problem
but then you you make use of that to extend your work in some
and uh and as i also t it depends like also like i think if uh boss is interested in working in both speech and text
you can understand very well
that part is also there
sure
are they are interested in that or no
no the boss
like have a it's like instead of saying like you should like work on both side you know the text and the speech aspect of it
so yeah
then uh one basic thing i suggested even thinking about i mean is exactly this stru all these scenarios that can be a meeting
that can be presentation where you have a s a relationship between speech between things that are said and uh some textual documents some way
yeah
why not try to to to to study this relationship to improve this relationship to use this relationship for um mm whatever it is
mm-hmm
yeah
indexing or annotation or whatever meta data extraction
and if you want for example this little work uh about seeing when the slide channel is background and foreground is not beginning of this kind of thing
mm
yeah
so a relationship between two channel that provide some kind of information
yeah
yeah
i think i think it's maybe an interesting test scenario and we know that you're sort of basing something around speech and and text
mm-hmm
i think there needs to be one sort of extra higher goal above that so that you can motivate future research
mm-hmm yep
mm-hmm
sure
yeah that's what what is missing
sure
sure sure sure sure
uh w one thing interesting is what we came up in the discussion also you about telling that uh detecting such scenarios where there is no relation between the slide and the person talking
mm-hmm
that may be one good starting point for you actually
mm-hmm
and then at that point y uh you detect something like that and then you show something like uh what you are saying that i if there is uh if uh there i if it is out of discussion
the words are no way are going to help your recognition anyway a. s. r.
but if it is more on the um the slide information is not going to help you
but uh if it is uh if it is related to the sli what he is giving a presentation on the slide then you show the your a. s. r. if you detect this even then you can show that how where you can really help or not help
because you say there's no correlation now
mm-hmm
but then here it comes that there at some point there might be a correlation there
no no be careful
for the recognition in general there is no correlation in the sense that even if you're talking about what is on the slide
mm-hmm
most of the words you use most of the words you use are not really correlated to that
hmm
mm-hmm
are simply words
yeah
and consider also that we all speak english here
yeah
and apart of uh native english speakers we have a very limited vocabulary in general
yeah
yeah this was
so we tend to use always the same words
but on average you know linguistic research shows that on average the people use five hundred words
that's what we have a disposition
so okay
yeah
and we say everything uh yeah
for english it's especially low
yeah
we say everything with that
and probably we not a native english speaker we use even less
so that's gives an idea of why basically in terms of recognition it doesn't really help because you always use anyway the same words
yeah
mm-hmm
and a few occurrences of words that are there in terms of recognition make one two percent
mm
so maybe it's not enough to justify uh an effort to improve the recognition
oh
speci
mm-hmm
then you can change of task and use a task the task we were mentioning about the back channel or foreground channel
okay
mm-hmm
in that case the only words that really are important are those words that appear on both slides
mm-hmm
the th sides and the talk
yeah
at that point i mean a little improvement of that it becomes a big improvement
i mean maybe in terms of recognition it's zero point five percent
yeah
yeah
but in terms of that task is maybe twenty percent
yeah
okay
well another thing you have to remember is these models have been tuned to include ami data
yeah
so i mean perhaps if you had slides and and presentations to do with something that was off topic
you didn't have you hadn't seen any prior data then you might see a bigger contribution as well
like another mic
yeah
mm-hmm
but i mean essentially you've actually sort of included the information from the slides in the language model
yeah
that's another interesting point
i mean we are using data that are fake
any uh in any case they are simulation no real data
yeah
and especially the slides
i think i've seen those slides
i mean they are pretty much artificial
okay
okay they're pre pre prepared
exactly
th yeah most of the most of the time you have the title to do no
mm-hmm
but but not pre prepare
okay
but
the ami dat the ami data what that like that only most of the time you knew they had the word
yeah but
the word you are going to present
everyone is presenting the same set of slide
yeah i yeah i mean uh everything is pretty much artificial
uh-huh
that that's what i mean
so you mention for example this uh fact that sometimes uh speakers tend to read
yeah
this is especially true when you have bullet list huh
yeah yeah
sometimes people really go through
it didn't happen in the data simply because uh uh it was not the same people prepa uh exactly
it's not there
okay
ah
so for example it will be possible in any case because the herve's infrastructure is ready and now we are going to collect the presentation
there maybe we can see
what about m. l. m. i.
w the one we collected last year
y the audio quality though
the audio is is is very bad
yeah
audio is very bad right
yeah
yeah
i i thing is really
uh one single channel or at least a closed channel collection no
you know that was collected m a little bit like this without uh too much care
it was it was uh a personal effort of mael that decided to do it
okay okay okay
it was really good to do it
it was good
tha tha tha that
was good to yeah
it was very good
but basically it was made without any specific know without thinking we want to recognize just to have them
uh okay
so the especially the audio channel is absolutely awful
yeah
so they are is there are still using that uh desktop microphone or what over there
ah
or
yeah they had like uh y uh y they you know they had this set up with the uh the microphones
so someone every it there was one microphone shared between every two people
uh
ah
but they had deals with people forgetting to turn the microphone on forgetting to turn it off
uh f it was it was meant i think they they chose that lecture theatre possibly with the idea that it would be good for collecting data
i mean i uh i'm sure they could have probably had university of edinburgh host it or whatever
mm-hmm
but i th i think the you know the h. c. i. part of it didn't quite work out to how they planned
yeah
okay
okay
so ap
that's fine yeah
uh that's uh that's that is one of the reason for example why which uh mark we point pretty much on slides as a mean of indexing
because at that point there is no interaction between humans and capture
yeah
because whenever you have microphones that you have to move it's it's it becomes complete uh really
it's a
yeah it's a
yeah
um it is i mean it's same as us putting on a the headphones and whatever
i mean even that minor thing
i mean any any audio captured during that period is i is rubbish
but there's no sort of system that's really built to d to be able to say when you're you're capturing that
yeah
yeah i understand
okay so now there be uh would be some time wh what is we should be getting a time recording system right
that uh uh uh so
we are building this slowly
i mean it's it's unfortunate
i mean is is is taking time for the material and so on
okay
mm
but yeah
the
there will be this
okay
uh what will that incorporate
will it incorporate like uh an s. m. a. and uh
uh it will be one camera pointing very general but just for display purposes essentially
yep
one uh microphone
and we are thinking to use uh lapel microphone you know this this thing
lapel
okay
and so that potentially helpful hopefully helpful to to do recognition
should be okay
yeah
and to slides through the projector
okay
okay
so no no uh microphone arrays or anything like that
i guess that's quite a that's a quite a bi big deal for setting up the recordings i guess
wo
let's say that uh in any case uh w well there are two reason
no it it's it's uh quite a bit yeah problem to do that kind of thing
first of all we are trying to do something that can be easily the the the idea is really it's something that you take you bring somewhere else and it works
yeah
so it must be as easy as possible
yeah
yep
but in any case i mean the device we are doing has input channels
so some way you can add as many input as we want
as you want yep
so we are dealing now with three
but there are other input uh lines open
mm
okay
yeah but probably we were the f you know the post uh the the thing is somewhere projector
suppose there's like the the white board or whatever the presentation is over there the speaker is more probably is going to this way or that way
so probably you you may not need a very big microphone either
probably one or two
yeah but let's pretend that it's not going to happen in any foreseeable future
uh uh ye uh yeah
uh yeah
wh uh the i mean i'm just thinking from practical perspectives
you'd you'd have to the the ami recognition system that we have now is either for these microphones or for the microphone array
mm-hmm
there's no lapel system trained for instance
mm-hmm
so i mean that in itself it would i mean you'd have some fun training some more speech recognition models
mm-hmm
although at that point we can use this
but
i mean i was mention the the lapel microphone mm just like this
but if you tell me this that's very interesting because at this point we can use this kind of things
yeah
hmm
yeah
yeah
but i don't why why not uh so there will be other data their test data
yeah that's
uh and especially for this kind of problem i think it can be a much more useful kind of data because there is real presentations
i mean is it's reality
sure
you know it's it's it's uh y n it it it it's exactly
yeah
it's what you should be using for this type of task
it's more realistic and um yeah probably it can help go in this direction of saying well let's see what happen between speech and slides
i think
uh
yeah
and every time we d we generate a new corpus and try to carry out new research we discover sort of areas that are too controlled you know
yeah yeah yeah
i mean the ami ones were a lot better in term of that than m. four or whatever
yeah
but still
mm-hmm
i mean es especially when you get into higher level sort of uh interpretation it's yeah
yeah
yeah yeah yeah yeah
oh well
i'm uh i'm just curious do the like the icsi meetings do they have anything other than the audio
yeah
do they have slides or anything along that i don't think they would
no the they the the the
no
okay i'm just thinking whether or not there an are any other sources i mean maybe chil data
chil may be interesting for you
but it's a l uh well yeah it may be interesting for your problem i think
y yeah
yeah
'cause it's i think it's gonna be more like the tam type situation
no no no
yeah
so
yeah it's more like tam
mm-hmm
but uh yeah
yep
the the their collection is much uh uh like they have uh r. t. n. s and all those thing
mm-hmm
people sitting and uh it's a lec it's a lecture uh a meeting collection
okay that is cool
yeah yeah
that's cool
and i uh is it through n n uh l. d. a. or something
i don't know
but i mean given that it's coming from the same basis as ami
i i expect there has to be some sort of relatively f liberal sort of distribution policy
uh yeah yeah
mm-hmm
yeah it's a it's a european project anyway
yeah
yeah
so i guess uh it must be available somewhere
so so probably we can yeah
chil may be interesting actually
yeah
you can look at it
yeah
the one thing about that and this is something that came up in the last nist evals was the fact that it's almost too uni modal
mm-hmm
you've just got one lecturer talking
so once again you don't see the the complex sort of levels of interaction
yeah
i mean uh y uh there's no way of getting around that
i mean you just have to think of a a task a challenge that is relevant to that type of recording
yeah
yeah
which might mm you might use the same methods as what we've been pr talking about today
mm-hmm
mm-hmm
but the actual sort of what you're trying to measure might need to be slightly slightly different i guess
mm-hmm
i don't yeah you know in terms of in terms of say measuring whether or not they're talking about the slides or off channel
m
yeah mm-hmm
i mean you might find ninety eight percent of your data is directly referring to your slides in a t in a tam
in the text
but only we're measuring one third
it's not
that is uh is in tams
at least in no i'm uh talking now about um the meeting
ami meeting
yeah but i'm i'm meaning if you move on to these corpora yeah
mm
how presentation of course
on presentation it it should be one hundred percent yeah
so you might wanna be doing something else basically yeah
yeah yeah yeah of course
no that is just something that in my opinion uh with the work that's been already done is something we can get pretty quickly
yeah
yep
it's an interesting task
it's more specific on uh meetings
yeah
certainly not for uh for presentation
yep
and it represent a nice task that can be measured that is clear and
yeah
and uh and at the s and at the same end of the day
you're probably going to be using or learning about the same techniques that you'll need for doing other things along these lines
mm yeah
yeah
mm-hmm
uh i in terms of actual recognition can of course uh help
mm yeah
so
so it's it's uh but of course not going to be it's not going to be a kind of thesis about this
okay
well but uh
no that doesn't make any sense
it well it's it's to make a proposal basically for your yep uh
i mean
it's a first step
s
that uh in a sense if you want i mean that that's at least the way i see the that list i have made for my own thesis
i mean uh you define that domain i mean which is uh large i mean which can be very general
this n
yep
so interaction between uh speech and slides cool
and then you see how all these things this two little works or the statistical independence
and detecting when it is uh are two little works that some way fit in that very general uh framework
hmm
okay
shown from this point of view it n that things mm there are other things
for example one that i really would like to do which is kind of fun
so when you have a bullet list can i click on one of the bullet and get the piece of speech where the guy was talking about that
yep
the sp
mm-hmm
yeah
mm-hmm
because sometimes people just read
sure
sometimes people uh im improve is more uh so for example that what that's another thing that fits in that kind of uh mm framework
hmm
sometimes it's a lot more
yeah
hmm
and that's interesting in terms of uh i mean first of all again is measurable in terms of browsing
yeah
in terms of retrieval in terms of indexing annotation meta data extraction
mm yeah
yeah
that can be applied in many
and we could uh do automatical uh speaker rating if there are good speakers or bad speakers depending if they just read uh
well you'd uh sure
that would be you know that uh that's uh that's something uh you're maybe joking now
that's that's a yeah
at l at at least spot if they forget to talk about something and it won't let them continue on to the next slide until they've gone through all the points
that's something that can uh be done for example
that that they have
mm-hmm
and uh some way there are parameters that can be measured that tell you that following certain uh criteria uh there is one very easy for example
yeah
mm-hmm
yeah
i had the the the sp there are speaker that never look at the audience
mm-hmm
those are bad speakers in general
yeah
it's very wrong
you have to look at the audience
mm-hmm
yeah
this is one
there is for example and this is something that eventually can be done
if you have a certain number of words on your slides you need a certain amount of time to read them
mm
the speakers that take a time which is too close to that they are not good speaker because some way uh um they're talking too fast
they're talking fast
mm-hmm
yeah
i had a problem i like find the answer for my own
well uh that that was just through sheer weight of content though
they are not uh
mm-hmm mm-hmm
yeah
yeah
yeah they are not giving you the time
and there is a certain number of things that can be uh some way detected and measured that tell you whether the speaker is actually respecting some form of uh uh
yeah
w
it's a bit uh of having difficult and uh i would not um go that much in that direction
b yeah
mm-hmm
i mean it's uh but you know you know uh
maybe possible someday
yeah
so what about the figure things
what happens if there's a figures coming on the slide
so what do you want to do with that
figure you know
as in five six you know number where where the graphemic yeah well i yeah
on the s uh-huh
either stop it
tables number
yeah
ah visual things
well that's for example with uh we submitted a project with j jean marc um to use that thing as meta data
okay
okay
and basically one thing for example we're trying to do and and again this is something that can fit huh
it will be not uh maybe
but but uh if you get the project et cetera in any case it's something that jean marc and me we want to do
uh based on the kind of graphic object you have so tables questions
okay
uh figures plots et cetera the side one for example it is a result
okay
try to get so that's again in terms of structuring browsing structure and retrieval okay when it is a result
okay
when it is an introduction
okay
yeah
when it is uh
although i remember discussing this like um 'cause uh when neville was working on his his stuff which was just based on the slides
okay
if um he he asked me all you know could i pre segment the slides for him uh
yeah
you know because you wanted to s you wanted to have the topic segmentation
yes yes yes yes yes yes
uh
and i said well just look at the the headings
yeah
because anybody generally who writes the slides yeah
um
usually in products and resources
it's not really true
it's not really it's not really true
it's not okay
it's true for me then
okay
yeah yeah it's not really true
mm-hmm
yeah that's o it's one of the most funny thing i mean you can see when you work in this thing
each one of us has an idea and then it's not true at all
i mean s some people actually are stick very carefully
if the p if they put in the outline uh let's say title one title two then you'll you find title one title two
yep
but many other people and i am one of those people for example are much more general
so my outline is something like introduction and experiments the results conclusions
okay
yeah
you don't find the same title in the slides
okay
okay
uh it yeah it depends yeah
it's it's really a different style of uh there are people that don't put for example outline
that's a stylistic thing as much as anything
yep
we were uh for example in the um corpus of m. l. m. e. so the one is on the demo
yeah
fifty percent of the presentation have no outline
hmm
in the corpus of the tam two thousand four tam presentation twenty five percent of the presentation have no outline at all
mm
yeah
which uh whether or not that's a good or a bad thing
that's that's uh what yeah uh w it is
it depends on the talk
yeah presentation yeah
and basically that's that's uh and again the outline is typical maybe in scientific presentation
yeah
well in that case that majority has
other kind of presentation probably no
yeah
i mean it's it's an habit we have
but um you but again uh
something we're taught at university from a very young age
i mean unfortunately th n there is nothing true
the structure
yeah yeah sure
it's all subjective
nothing true is is everything is chance pretty much
so uh that was on
hmm
okay
on possible work
okay
okay so what are you going to do between the data when you collect and this
what do you want to do now
by the time you get the data it's going to take another two months if i am right the whole capturing system when it is going to come
mm-hmm
so what is the next step
well uh did trying to really determine the um the um uh subject of something for my proposal i mean
yeah you have to submit it in like two months also again
yeah aro around february or march
yeah yeah to submit yeah
so really um
okay
it's one year right
yeah yeah
it's quite strictly imposed now
yeah
so to find something for that
uh also with the th thinking maybe turning this uh work into publication the one about the for sure
not maybe
for sure
for sure
you you need it bad
and uh also uh uh well that uh depends a little on on on you
but try to finish with the um measures and the call routing
call routing where
that's inte
ye
'cause i was talking with that uh about that to herve uh since i was uh i will recycle this poster for i. m. two
you know about uh about this
and uh that could be cool to to finish it
maybe fuse it with uh ian's work and uh do a journal paper he was suggesting
i think we should yeah
yeah
after the after the hard drive crash we took the time to actually rebuild the the the system and actually train 'cause originally we sort of had the idea of oh we'll use a recognizer that's been trained on a large amount of telephone speech data and that should give us a better result
this is yeah
uh h oh
yeah
i just as a contrast i trained one specifically on this data
results were almost identical um which says to me there's something wrong with the data rather than and it's nothing serious
yeah
it's simply that it hasn't been um chunked it or or segmented in a way that's typical of speech resources
mm yeah
in terms of um you can have like uh a two second utterance uh credit cards and then twenty seconds of silence coming after it
mm-hmm
mm yeah
i see
which in which when you f when you first think about it you just think oh silence whatever nothing will happen
uh uh
but a lot of the normalization that we use
i know
yeah yeah
i know i know i know
uh yeah c. m. s. c. c. v. n.
uh so w we need a decent end point detection system running before we can we can we can do that
uh yeah
i see
yeah
and we're converging on having one now just in in sort of tandem with this development of this web based recognizer
even if little bit of
oh
this
um but of course unfortunately all these things take time
uh ye yeah
um but i i think we should see a decent sort of improvement then
yeah
no no i think you yeah it's uh it's huge
yeah
not just in terms of no longer having recognition errors whenever silence appears
'cause you get that immediate benefit that you don't have any insertion errors
but also it should actually affect the recognition on the speech segments as well
and so essentially say well as there is this silence time which tend to be even more than than how it is
it it it's non determinist
th
the
so better to have a kind of silence detection
so something that really takes this and they recognize only that uh that part
yeah
yeah
this will improve the phoneme uh recognition rate
mm that's the hard p oh i might uh given the trouble we've had with this corpus i can't make any promises
yeah that's what we expect to
that's what it of of course of course of course
and at that point even the uh call router that uh jean jean yves has uh made can improve uh its performance
yeah
that's the intention yep
exa that's the intention there
and it can be used after uh tool for the measure work
uh
so so you're so what you are saying is that you you noticed that when you um tried other features and uh
sure sure
sure
mm ye
we trained the system just on this data
like there were there were six thousand utterances that weren't used for uh the call routing side of things
that we got
mm-hmm
i think they th there were thirteen thousand in the entire corpus
six t half of them roughly we've thrown away
mm-hmm
so use that for acoustic training
and the results from that were almost the same as what we got for the c. t. s. model
mm
because and initially it was a s nuance trained on nuance uh no
no no no no no
y yeah
it i
but one can imagine a commercial system uh that that that s steven cox used from nuance probably had all these things
or
built in end point detection et cetera et cetera
yeah
mm-hmm mm-hmm
so
surely they should they should have had that actually
mm-hmm
so maybe like we had to do this end point detection and probably a little bit of final filtering
mm
and then i think you should be pretty much converging to the system
yeah
but the still the reason with the the they had like what are the systems we train on databases are they are chop neatly
that there is not too much silence beginning not too much silence at the end
mm-hmm
sure sure
then oh yeah yeah yeah
i know
i know the problem
they are they are j they they chopped so neatly for the it like custom made database
but uh here it's not like that you know like uh-huh
yeah
i see
and there's also just things like tele uh receiver noise at the beginning and or at the end of the and i mean these these are things you can get rid of if it's a
i see
i see
yeah yeah yeah
yeah
yeah yeah
i see
there are the several things
i see the problem
like one thing is like we can do this begin and end detection as we said
mm
or you and he can uh we can try to use uh france telecom's uh approach actually
and that um uh uh they they have this front end which uh uh which which can do a spectral
yep
and plus it can give you a voice activity detection
mm okay this is f okay
part f part from basis it can give
okay
so somethi we can just yeah we can just run it quickly and see
we can just run some generic yeah
and probably you will have to run it
will give you the idea that is it okay like
well i don't mind running it
yeah
i've got all the scripts set up
no no no no
uh not running i mean to say p probably uh he should run it or uh like we can ge help him to run it actually
so
because at some point he has to get into
uh
i'm not not sure it's
well i'm not i'm not sure i see the point actually
i mean to say i i mean to say that it's okay
yeah
uh
i'm losi
we have all the scripts
but probably uh he should run it i mean to say
mm
i don't know
yeah
whatever i don't know thing th i don't know whether that a
it's a
run run run what exactly
the all these experiments probably
i don't know whether that's a
for the the the call routing itself or the recognition uh the phoneme recognition
uh the they are uh the scri because up to uh probably maybe we shall do mm it yeah
uh for to make it faster we should ru it run maybe
if we run f we ourself it it's very fast
we might as well
'cause i mean we've up until now uh you haven't been running any recognition on and neither did jean yves on that on that data
uh yeah
yeah
no
no
yeah
mm-hmm
i have all uh jean yves's uh scripts and uh programs for performing the call uh routing i think uh starting from the phoneme sequences
okay
mm okay
yeah
yeah
no but i mean to say that if you if you if you if you if you give him the scripts and ask him to run uh the
oh sure but i mean the scripts are so automated it's just a matter of sitting uh uh submitting a job to the cluster and
uh no
yeah
but it's uh
yeah i i know that i don't know how to use the cluster
i don't i don't see the point of that
i don't mind running it
yeah
that'd it'd be like uh half an hour's work in a day to run the recognition scripts
i mean i i i i know you're saying
artem should familiarise himself with the a. s. r. systems or whatever
yeah oh yeah
fine
but i don't uh i d i don't think this is a point that's worth sort of worrying about at this stage anyway
yeah
i mean
yeah if it's just running a script i don't know if it's
well 'cause i'm i'm sort of assuming that that we're gonna have so an end point detection regardless of this working on this nuance corpus
yeah that uh-huh
no no no no i the end point system is different thing no
so
that's and we need it for ami plus other thing
we need it for ami
and so but the i am to all saying yeah
we need it for um the online demo
for uh all these things yeah
i i am
but this is basically detecting speech and no non speech
it's it's a lot more difficult than you would think
it's n it uh no no no it's not speech non speech
yeah
it's this uh problem i hear every time on the speech meeting how do we detect speech and not speech
uh uh it's uh it's uh it's yeah
well it's speech and any and any other class of sound
ah and uh
that's the problem
yeah
or oh okay
it's
any anything nonsense or else it beeped
mm
and is
it's not just speech and silence
it's speech and and okay
and any other class yeah
it's not silent
it's uh you can say that's very yeah
if it was just silence it'd be easy
but uh um and in controlled places you can't just assume it's it's you know any energy below a certain threshold
mm-hmm
and this is what everybody sort of claimed the problem was solved with years ago
mm-hmm
but
but who really can do uh when somebody will really be able to do that
i mean detect the speech from non speech it will be a little revolution no in the
well i mean this is once again a
yeah sure
but i mean this is once again a very constrained task again
i mean it's it's it's you you're almost assured it's only gonna be a single speaker on the microphone
mm-hmm
so i mean the the only sorts of noise you're gonna have to deal with uh is is is hiss or impulsive i would say
and it can be it can be anything
yeah
or or that would be a good start
breathing
yeah
no anyway so we okay so we'll finish this call routing stuff
what do you say all thi this is okay with you right
so we'll k because i think uh it it it has not been even submitted outside also the work what jean yves did yet
no no
no no
basically because it was not at uh at a level that could be anyway
mm yeah not done that yet
tried
uh yeah he still yeah
so the idea was good
i think yeah with a better uh phoneme recognition rate definitely it could uh improve also the the call routing performance
yeah
yeah
it was showing that
um you haven't heard from him i take it either
nope
no
but we can we can find
uh uh
okay
well it'd be nice to get the thesis i think
there's a sort of just a research report sort of basis for this
yeah
yeah yeah
yeah yeah
yeah
but
but we can some way find a guy
i mean this should should be have all details
so it should be relatively easy to at least this is the last news i had and then i can try to get him back
okay
yeah
apply some pressure
uh
yeah
so yeah it it's pretty much good time also no
and he c he can and uh when do you intend to start writing the proposal
probably you should start i think
s slow
yeah well this is basically in my three uh main jobs uh proposal uh um this
little bit start thinking
no no you you should not wait till the end
that's what i mean to say
uh n no it should be looking towards the start of next year basically
ah yeah yeah
yeah but yeah
uh yes
ah yeah sure
because you
but uh uh uh shouldn't make it clearer before on the on the on what uh i i will write
the is it so i mean you should
because it
and even uh a first uh uh submission using this work um will make things clearer for me uh writing them down and f for it will help i think for that also
okay
yeah
no
going very pra pragmatic uh there is a submission uh deadline for example thirty one december for conference on multi media and expo where i think these two little works on
mm
mm
mm-hmm
uh
okay which is
yeah it can go there yeah
mm
yeah
so it can be
see
and it's nice to get some feedback on i mean that feedback will probably come after your proposal possibly
mm-hmm
no no no
but um
i think it's uh it's good if he submits his pr proposal
as a research report you put here submit it for the conference
it's quite good for the proposal directly
yeah
yeah yeah yeah
mm-hmm
exactly
it's as a proposal
yeah
yeah
because as far as i understand this work on the phoneme anyway still takes some development time in the sense that uh no
no
i think uh we we may have to like it can have a uh it's it's kind of like uh uh maybe take like uh uh two or three days
you know like to sit out and say uh one converge to one approach and then just do without that yeah
okay
n yeah sort out any bugs or whatever
i see
yeah
and probably yeah
so that is the thing
we have to sort out the bug kind of thing and see how reliable is this end point detection for us
mm-hmm
yeah
i i i'd prefer to go back to the c. t. s. models i think as well 'cause i think i think they did work a little bit better
and
yeah mm-hmm
yeah
uh yeah i think uh then we can go back to c. t. s. actually
anyway the good news is that there are results
so yeah
you are you have just to to decide uh yeah what what what uh what you want to work first and and and finalise
yep
mm-hmm
i think you can really start finalising mm-hmm
yeah
well i think uh first uh this submitted and this will help for the proposal
yeah
and since uh we cannot start immediately with the measures i think that's the best thing to do
mm-hmm
mm-hmm
okay
and uh yeah so that is this
so you wanted to talk something more than that
well we obstructed you with that
you wanted to talk something different also
mm well no
no
well for me it's i think we uh it's fine
or maybe another meeting
yeah it's okay
hayes is another one isn't it
and then i say i don't remember
oh okay sorry
i was like 'cause i saw you sli i saw you looking at your watch before and i like wow
no i was just looking this
gonna have to s have this ami corpus linked in no time
okay uh we are not out of time you know
yeah and i think uh that will be exactly one hour and uh uh fill the tape
yeah
so the tape is ta tape is at the end
uh the tape is sixty minutes
yeah yeah it's happened uh it happened with my friend
oh okay
ah so i was right
like uh he was taking pictures pictures pictures and it was going thirty seven thirty eight forty even
so i said there's some problem with yours uh your uh uh the way he uh put the roll inside
ah yeah
uh-huh
there is some problem it has got stuck somewhere
it can never go to forty one forty yeah i uh uh thirty seven thirty eight is fine
uh not normally yeah
it could go to thirty seven thirty eight
mm-hmm
yeah
forty forty one is but see he has already
mm-hmm
yeah we've been told
don't listen
yeah
okay
yeah
okay
fine
okay
or you get it
okay
no i don't think so it has to be like that yeah and you have to adjust the length
okay and then
so we uh we will wait for anna a few minutes
yeah s yeah um
mm
yours is well
i think you can put anywhere you want actually
yeah but the the mic should not
i thin
it's not a directional mic anyway
i think it should work like this
uh
so i will try to get my presentation running
yeah
yeah
mm
mm
can't help you with that
last
it's no matter
okay it's y yeah
no problem
ah yes
right
okay
then press uh al
okay
this
i don't know
you know
just try
'kay
on this normal
oh oh
alt f. five
good
doesn't appear on the screen here
right well
oh
wow
amazing
it's working
okay
thank you
uh
hold that
yes and you can put can clip it uh on your
okay
somewhere
okay
mm
so good morning everyone
um
welcome at uh at the kick off meeting of our uh latest project
i hope you all have been uh updated about it
yeah
good
so
yes
so w we will try to structure this uh meeting with an a with an agenda uh as presented here
um after the opening we will tr get acquainted to each other
see what our roles are in this project
so um
we have been provided with uh some uh w technical tools to uh
to communicate and to well learn from each other's plans uh as i can say um so w
we will also try to uh
to get acquainted to this tools so they are also new to me i don't know whether you worked with them before
um then we will come to the uh to the to the actual project plan
you all know i hope how it's about uh the uh new r remote control we are going going to design
mm-hmm
total
uh then we will uh discuss uh well how it should be and uh
wh what uh what our new product should look lite like
and uh well then uh after some twenty five minutes i hope uh we can end this meeting
so
um basically this is about a uh a new c remote control
um
we when you design a new product you of uh you of course want it to be original
be uh we want to be distinguished mm
people uh want to uh when they look at the shelf want to think well that's the product i i need
so it needs to be trendy
i mean trendy is what people want so then i w they will buy our product
but then uh it also should work uh user friendly and uh otherwise people uh uh well it will not be uh
be rated very well in consumer uh articles and like that
so the general outline of uh new project will be we first uh go through a functional design phase
um
you all get uh um certain task uh in this uh in this phase and uh
then we will meet again and uh discuss this functional design
and the same holds for the uh
ph two phases uh after this the conceptual design
and after that a a more detailed design in which the the final project should get its definite shape
alright but first we will do some uh tool training
in all in front of you uh you see uh the uh
notebooks and w uh n note blocks and we have here a
a a a white board
whitebo
mm-hmm
and um well it should work uh i've read it from my uh from some colleague that it should work with some kind of toolbar
i didn't find out yet how it work but maybe one of you did so
um
under documents in the shared folder
okay
yes
do do we have to say something about that
i i i'm not fully updated about this shared folder uh
yeah i guess we'll have a shared folder uh with documents that we can share
and uh yeah
yes well we will then find out ho how it works
yes
um
well this seems to me yes some computer program but i didn't find it yet
so we'll come to that later
so uh now we will try out the white board we have here
so
i would suggest uh
each of us is going
well yes um we uh we should try to t to draw on it and then well it should be smart some way
i i'm not really sure how this works but
okay shall i start
mm
yeah you can start it you know
yeah
yes a good idea mael
i think for us it's just like a normal whiteboard but they'll be recording what we write down
so i
no they will record through that
there's a sensor over there which is going to record the strokes that you make
mm
mm
but for us it's just like a normal whiteboard
okay
yeah
'kay
but it's
actually i think i cannot go with uh
you you
d doesn't it work
maybe someo maybe maybe anna maybe you can start
mm-hmm
yeah
then he can maybe find out to get his cord right
i have to draw
so um
l why don't you draw uh your favourite animal on on th on the white board
m my my favourite animal
sorry this is all tangled up here
oh i see uh
that's better
yeah
yeah
yes
mm
so draw it
we will try to guess what it is
mm-hmm
i'm a very bad drawer
weird
um
you're not gonna be able to guess from my drawing
i'm a bad drawer
okay
mm
they're ears by the way
's a cat
no
um close though
okay so like a pet animal
okay
like a cat
yeah
it's like a cat so i guess it's a cat
no not a cat though
what is this now
ah you forget about it
you're on the knife
yeah uh i think it's fine
i just don't want to carry it off
man this wires eh
we need a wireless microphone
you know
pro specially we should next project we should take l like that
so that's the cat
okay
so
it's not a cat it's a dog
oh
so
mael
it's a dog
yes
so but that's also kind of cat isn't it
oh the dog doesn't have a tail
it's got a tail then
b bo both predators
yeah sure yeah
yeah yeah
i thought so
the dogs have a tail
so thank you
so do cats
uh d did you uh work out cord
and you guessed cats without a tail
yeah
yeah i think i will go without without it right
okay
okay
it'll still not extend right
it's not up to that
okay there you go
so what favourite characteristics
uh
dogs are always friendly and loyal and fun
a horse
it's a horse
this is why you're the designer
and i'm marketing
yes
yes yes this is yes definitely a horse
yes
oh very good
so
ah
i suppose it
ah i think you can put that
mm-hmm
that's it
a blue and black zebra
yes
can you can meet them in africa i think
yes
very good
so
the very rare blue zebras
yes
i'll tell to get it off my
ma matthew
uh
mm-hmm
so
you got a lot of room here
maybe
you can probably reach
oh y it's not for that
no
no
i hope you have some space in your uh the horse of uh mael
okay
yeah
so what should i draw
mm
he has already to do cat
i took a dog
um
a mouse
this looks likes a cat who has been driven over
okay
yeah
and we should sum up its favourite charas characteristics right
mm-hmm
yes the moustache
so
that's that's definitely a cat
mm-hmm
uh yeah
and i th they like to sleep that's why you said you they are like this
it's quite you know relaxed situation
yeah
yes
mm-hmm
yes okay
she has the small legs
th thank you matthew
yeah
thank you matthew
it's a very big rat
perfect
or a very small cat
oh a rat okay
yes this is certain uh
some contribution to our project
and you
mm 'kay
your turn
so
let's see
which animal has not been drawn yet
so you've all drawn land animals so why not draw an animal from the water
a bird
okay in the water
ah i don't know what that is
it's a bit
mm
mm
it's a bit hard to guess
yeah
so
put it colours
maybe it would help us
yeah
yes
the cat is going to eat the fish or the rat
with different pen widths
mm-hmm
so
oh it's a shark now
ah it's a shark yeah
oh yes why not
good idea
ah it's a baby shark it looks to me you know it's going to eat the cat rather than the cat eating the fish no
mm
oh
now it's a swordfish
why not
you have some in in australia right
a swordfish
swordfish
yeah
um maybe
i dunno
i've never seen one no
oh well
yeah
i hope it still works
perfect
so
so i dunno if we need to spend time on that actually but uh
you should go for the next one it seems to me
w well this uh this tool seemed to work
yeah exactly yeah
mm-hmm
let's continue to uh to the real stuff
wow
um our project uh finance uh
thing
uh when we are and when w you are uh going to design w uh we must keep in mind that the selling price of the product uh will be about twenty five euros
so when
designing a project uh i also look at you uh mael keep in mind uh uh uh people uh
twenty four
yeah
want to get the feeling this is a twenty five euro project uh pr um
per remote control yeah
product
mm
per project
yes
okay
um more interesting for our company of course p uh profit aim about fifty million euro
so we have to sell uh quite a lot of this uh um things
uh we will try to uh
to get at a international market uh so um it will be i think mainly europe and uh northern america
ah yeah the sale man four million
maybe some uh asian countries
um also important for you all is um the the product uh production cost must be maximal uh twelve uh twelve euro and fifty cents
so it's half of the selling price if i am good in mathematics
yes of course
uh um i mean we still have to uh to make a profit huh
of course
they have to sell at least four million to make a profit
mm
you all have to be paid
mm
ah we have to make we have to sell at least four million to make our own profit
excuse me
oh you're g very good in mathematics
fifty mill
yes
yes indeed
four million
so uh well i think w when we are working on the international market
yeah
uh in principle it has enough customers uh so when we have a good product we uh we could uh meet this this aim i think
so that about finance
and uh now just let have some discussion about what is a good remote control and uh well keep in mind this this first point
it has to be original it has to be trendy it has to be user friendly
um maybe someone can mention some additional uh prerequisites for a good remote control
mm-hmm
of course it should have a on off button
mm-hmm
yes well i it should have the the the the expected functionality uh of a remote control
mm
yeah
yeah s and it depends what application you are using it for
mm
you might need uh
we wer we were thinking television
uh
mm
we are targ targeting the television set
so you need to record the channels
mm
yeah
mm-hmm
you need to browse the browse the channels in upward downward way
yes yes
mm
th th that's very handy i i always miss it and on some remote controls that you can go channel up or down ins instead of retyping the number
uh
and
mm
especially when you have a lot of channels
mm
uh and
and uh just before starting the detailed discussion maybe we you are the marketing guy
or th so you are the marketing
i'm marketing
marketing
yep
and you are in the u use user interface uh design
yeah
yes
so just yeah i wanted to to be sure
yeah
and i i'm the the industrial designer okay
sure
mm-hmm
yes
because i i don't know you very well actually but yeah
oh
i'm matthew
okay
you know
mael
matth s uh anna
happy to meet you
anna
okay
it's very uh
and um uh matthew yeah
a and i'm nanne
i thi think you know me yeah
so
uh so yeah uh just uh on your web page but uh yeah not uh not face to face
right yeah
yes
so
um
s
so mm
so
s s
mm
so i
are there some other very important things to to do well
so
to specify in this first phase of of the project
so the browse function as you m mentioned
mm
yeah
and uh
oth yeah
you'd need the usual ones like the changing the volume changing the the channel and then you uh today we have uh um teletext and all those things
yes
yeah
tomorrow you might have a some more functions which might come through that so
yes
mm
like what
like internet on the on t. v.
yeah i. p. o. or
mm
now we are looking for
television things or i. p.
for example personal video recorder and all those stuffs are coming up
yeah
mm
but we can't really design for something that hasn't been invented yet
yeah
ah it's it's it's it's coming up actually
the personal video recorder and all those things it is coming up
mm well uh i i think
actually yeah w
uh w y you two should should i think think this over uh w espec what what functionality
let's let's take
of course and first before um designing the func well thinking about the functionalities we need to know what are the user requirements
mm
yeah
um then if they need internet then we would be able to to p to propose something with uh uh t. v. over i. p.
mm-hmm
yeah
mm
yeah
but before
but
ninety percent of the time ninety nine percent of the time people will be using the main functions the volume the different channels
so we can have all the fancy things as well but the main controls need to be very obvious and very easy to use
mm mm mm
keep k keep in mind i it's a it's a twenty five euro unit so uh uh the the very fancy stuff uh
w we can leave that out i think
so twenty five euro you expect a quite well normal but good functioning user friendly remote control
mm
mm
oh in that case you can you always hook up with uh someone who is providing that and you know
you you sell their product as well as your product with them you know
mm
yeah but w w we want to design a new one
so try and get t. v. manufacturers to
yeah
no it's okay yeah i understand
mm
so we need some numbering buttons some teletext things and then um
yeah
the yeah the main is browsing
yes but but but ab about the spec the buttons the buttons uh that will be on it
yeah
yeah
i i think we can discuss that in the in the next meeting
yeah
uh i would like to get this wrapped up and go to an end of this meeting
okay
so
okay we are alread mm
okay
so you know now the basic the basic things
mm
yeah
mm-hmm
and
well just just for the next meeting um
l
well uh you wor yes work on a design
keep it general i mean so w we will be still fle flexible with maybe adding some functions
mm-hmm
so
um
you will be working on on
technical function design so
yeah sure
and uh you and you and uh uh uh well think about requirements eh
mm-hmm
does it need internet or or do do we stay at
stam
basic basic television uh interface
yeah
so uh
i think we should now all go work uh uh at this and uh you will be informed via email and other kind of communication
mm-hmm
yeah
okay
so next meeting will be in uh in thirty minutes uh
perfect
k keep it in mind
okay
so i see all everybody's here 'kay
mm-hmm
yep
and we can start meeting
okay
what's the agenda for this meeting
the i will uh
present here agenda with with with with slides
okay
to you
um
as you can see here
perfect
so first uh just to mention i will
take notes uh of this meeting and uh i will try to work them out and give them to you
mm-hmm
i've also made notes of the previous meeting and um i was about to send them you but then uh i had to go to this uh meeting so you will get them too uh
mm-hmm
next
um
so y you are the secretary also
yes
right
okay
indeed
um
then i hope you all have uh worked out some some uh some some presentations about uh about well you the the task given to you in the previous meeting
perfectly yeah yeah of course uh-huh
um
w we will uh in a minute we will uh start with them
um we will see in which order we will handle them of
um then i will uh bring in some some some new requirements i i got uh from the uh account manager
i try to work them out they were quite abstract and we can have maybe have com some discussion about it
mm-hmm
uh um about the functions and well in this meeting we should really try to reach a decision about the target group
mm
and the functionality of the
you mean the social target group who we wants to target
yes i mean well yes w who are we going to uh to well to sell this the customers indeed yes
mm
oh the customers okay
yeah
think that's that's important matter
that's the big question yeah
uh
so and then uh we will close this meeting uh and after this meeting we'll uh we'll have a lunch
good
um
maybe um
why uh anna can you c do you have a presentations
no i don't
you don't have presentation
i wasn't
no
uh you want a table to to uh
i c i can talk about it but i have no slides or anything
yes yes maybe maybe you can uh can just talk about it or maybe you can use the whiteboard if necessary um
mm-hmm
well i've just been um presented with some research we've done in a small focus group so a hundred people
just asked them about their remote control usage habits and what they want in a remote control
um
it's probably can't email this to you i've just got a web page with some data on it
um basically it's saying that
users generally dislike the look and feel of their remote controls
um seventy five u seventy five percent of users find most remote controls ugly
mm-hmm
um
eighty percent of users would spend more money when a remote control would look fancy
um
current remote controls do not match well the operating behaviour of the user
uh seventy five percent of users said they zap a lot so they use their remote control quite frequently while they're watching television
uh
fifty percent of users say that they only use ten percent of the buttons
so they've got a remote control with a lot of functionality but really most of the time they only use a small part of that
mm
um
do you do you have this uh information on the web page you said
i have an a web page yes
yes mayb maybe you can can send an email to me later uh
yep
yep sure
uh about this
mm-hmm
so basically um there's a breakdown of how much they use the different functions on a rem remote control
um power and volume selection are only used a few times within this uh per hour
um channel selection is used a hundred and sixty eight times um and then there's things like channel settings audio settings which are only used very infrequently
mm
um
teletext is used um fourteen times in the hour so it is used but not nearly as much as the channel selection is used
mm
um
an interesting thing that this report has brought up is that um fifty fifty percent of users report that the remote control gets lost a lot of the time in the room
yes yes i have that too
so some way of some way of locating the remote control would be very useful to a lot of users
um
thirty four percent said it takes too long to learn to use a remote control they want something that's easier to use straight away more intuitive perhaps
mm
um
it's it's easy to learn or how do you say it's
thirty four percent said it took too much time to learn to use a new one
okay too much time to learn
yep
okay
um
not enough
and thirty twenty six percent said remote controls are bad for r. s. i.
i don't know how we'd go about combating that
what do you mean there
for r. s. i.
respet repetitive strain injury
okay
mm
so
but
they think that or do their doctor the doctor says
mm
but it's it's the opinion of the uh of the users huh
yeah
that's what the report says yeah
so mm
um and then it's got a demographic breakdown on
maybe y y you cannot put this webpage online on the
uh i should be able to actually if i email it to you now
you can disconnect it there no
you can maybe just just
ah it's it okay it's a webpage on the c. it's a file okay
oh no yeah
yeah
o otherwise you yeah
um s hang on
then you can connect this one or this one yeah
you can connect this one
all to your computer
yeah
well
so these are important numbers that matthew and i need to take into account for our functional um
oh yeah
oh i need to muck around with this
it's probably easier if you put it on yours and then i'll just email it to you
hmm
it's just a web link
yeah
okay
yeah these numbers have have to be have to be taken into account
hmm
for the uh both yeah user interface and functional design
yeah
one thing it goes on to talk about which is interesting is the hang on a minute
because if there are many numbers and we need to select to to constraint uh our design based on what is more important
mm-hmm
mm-hmm
yep
um one thing is interesting is talking about
um speech recognition in a remote control
speech recognition in
and who would pay more for that and whether people would find it useful
d do you have numbers o o on that
ah okay
yes i'll just get this up
so that we don't do we not need any button on the remote control it would be all based on speech
well potentially yeah um
okay
i think even for interesti yeah i think that would not work so well
interesting idea
you wanna have both options
okay
well it would it would be a solution for uh when your
remote control is lost i mean when it has speech recognition then
mm-hmm
uh i then it doesn't matter where it is my well it's we should be in range
yeah
mm
or maybe it can respond and produce sound so say where it is
yeah
but the these are all quite fancy features i'm not sure whether
well it would be f
we will we can make this for for twelve euro fi and fifty cents
yeah
yeah
no you can't
and we don't know where the state of the art of speech recognition is maybe you know
oh
well it depends you know like
there is uh it's a very small vocabulary that you want to do the operations like you want to say on off
mm
one two
but it's quite noisy if there is the t. v. uh shouting
mm
twenty three yeah
yeah
it's it's going to be li it's not going to be s so easy but
yes that that that that's mm
u usually it's going to be more of an isolated
do you have some more important facts or
case but it's but i don't know with twenty fi
okay
um
can we go to the next presentation
so you had to to to summarise maybe the
well
this is now talking about um who would pay for speech recognition in a remote control who would pay more for it um
ninety percent of the fifteen to twenty five year old market said that they would pay more
it goes down from there seventy six percent for twenty five to thirty five
thirty five percent for thirty five to forty five um twenty two percent for forty five to fifty five and then eight percent for fifty five to sixty five
mm
okay it's uh decline
okay
yeah
mm-hmm
but we sh yeah it really depends where we're gonna be targeting this product um which we'll be talking about later i think
decline with age mm
mm
mm
yes
we will talk about it later
did you get the email
okay
yep that one
mm-hmm
just follow that link
i thi you us yeah yeah
it'll be in a different window yep
that's left that one
yep
okay perfect
mm
so that's the figure that i was just talking about there with the different demographics
okay
another thing it's talking about there is the l. c. d. screen but there's no figures apparently on that
mm
mm 'kay
okay
um
uh maybe uh mael c c can you give uh uh your presentation uh
yeah
mm i okay i stay
oh this is
now you can move i think yeah
i can move as far as
mm-hmm y y you can move uh
maybe i take your chair
i okay
yes
you can you can sa take my chair
it's a channel selection a module this and this function go to the
sorry
oh
yeah
so i think as everybody knows uh i'm the uh industrial designer
and uh in this presentation uh this group presentation um is gonna focus on the working design of the the remote control
um i'd like first to give a quick a very simple introduction how does it work
so that everybody knows even if you don't have a very uh technical background uh what is it because i think in the product it is important
mm
so basically um the basic function of a remote control is to send uh messages to another system that is fixed
mm-hmm
and so an energy source feeds an integrated circuit the chip that can compose messages
usually uh through a um infrared bit and uh the user interface controls the chip and accordingly the the messages alright
mm-hmm
so my method for um designing the yeah the work design uh yeah first the the main point is that i would wish to to make a really functional product
i would prefer to have very functional um capabilities rather than fancy stuff that in fact is not used and doesn't work
mm
mm-hmm
so for that yeah as it's important to take into account the user requirements from the marketing uh expert uh anna and um
mm-hmm
w to to we should agree on what are the technical functions uh for this remote control and i show you the the working design
so um basically uh here is a really large view of what we want
uh we want an on off button it can be uh it's simple but it's it's important
mm
and also uh the to both channels as well as other buttons that come after right
so the components i quickly draw here
is that in this part you have the remote control the the sender and on the other part the receiver so that's my method is um will be to well my aim would be to uh design the and choose the chips and the infrared um components to build the remote control right
mm-hmm
mm-hmm
so of course we need energy sources and uh uh the receiver a a receiver
this is very quick uh design uh you stop me or interrupt me if uh you don't agree on it on that
mm-hmm
and um so what i have found and after a lot of work actually i i draw this i draw for you this uh schema that can be maybe too technical for you but is very important for me you know
well
uh-huh
you drew it a long time ago
is huh
and uh that's it so i won't go into details about that but uh these are my preferences to use uh that kind of components
ninety one
overwhelming
no
and and why do you want these kind of component
so
i mean are they cheap or are they uh reliable
what were your
so the the main components you see here are the cheapest i have found and
yeah th you have always a compromise with uh reliability and uh i if it's expensive
mm
but uh this one was not this one also really uh reliable um so
yeah that's it for the working design
uh i hope you get clearer view on uh what what a remote control is uh in terms of uh technical components but maybe yeah
yes
it it
it's more clear now i think
so
but is it uh can you just buy it on the market and f plug it in or you want to ma
no no no no we we will uh this is a preference but we can always change uh
mm-hmm
what i w what i was thinking about uh the the the schema uh about uh the sender and the receiver
i mean can you can you get back to it
yeah
yeah uh the receiver is of course already in the television and we are not uh able to change it
of course yeah
so we we must adapt to the to the receiver
i i suppose there is a standard uh way of communicating to televisions uh
yeah
we will use uh infrared protocol uh using yeah infrared and uh
and of course we need to adapt to that protocol that already exists and but we what we can do is uh uh adapting the the chips inside uh to the best uh chips and uh infrared bubbles
mm-hmm
mm
mm
mm
mm
yes
okay
um
okay
thank you
well it to du it's just you had to change the frequencies
the frequencies
yeah yeah
yeah
of course yeah in the chip you have it yeah
but you should be careful people are sometime becoming problem
like a guy has recently designed a remote uh uh uh which could switch off any other t. v. s so basically through all the things
that can control o other things
yeah
mm
ah
so maybe we should think of yeah
of course yeah we should take that into account in the uh
yeah yes i i i
that's handy
so if the b t. v. in the next apartment's really loud you can just turn it off
yeah so you can just go on the street and then switch off everyone's t. v. and you can just walk away you don't have to be near the t. v. at all
yeah
i i feel i i i think m mael will will consider this uh th these things
i like that idea
maybe maybe we can go to to your presentation uh matthew
yeah so
i i i assume you were finished here
yes
uh okay
okay
so i can take i think mine now there
okay
okay so voila
hmm i can take mine it's okay voila mm so mm
okay
oh
i
uh sorry
i know where it is
it's on the desktop
it's uh
technical function
yes
okay
it's uh
like so
well
so um i'm going to talk a little bit about the technical function so wha what actually it's about what is the user going to do
i think my last presented what is going inside so what's the user is going to see from the outside and how he is going to use it
mm-hmm
yep
so well the approach is that uh
basically the idea is to send a message to the t. v. set as mael has pointed
and it will be decoded by the t. v. and usually we it is easier to have uh keys or buttons with which people can uh press and then um changing a button will basically uh change the message which is being sent to the t. v. and uh um a and basically it sends an internal signal and decoded by the receiver
mm-hmm
so p as um anna has said that this ki people are interested in things which are you don't need to k press the keys
people are can have a speech recognition but this is uh s a question which will we have to see later
but in the present scenario is that you have certain keys and you press it like your mobile phone and it sends a message to the t. v.
mm-hmm
mm
yep
and um so generally mm i don't have some figures sorry but um so there are two kinds of uh remote if you popularly in the household
actually so you have a standard t. v. remote where you have just a on off button and play
uh volume change and uh keys for the number and more than one digit option
and if you see for example righ right now uh uh even the one uh on more than one digit option is for two digit channel which is like ninety nine
but tomorrow you might have one fifty channels you know to browse or two hundred channels to browse who knows but uh uh
then there is uh this is the standard one with without any fancy thing you know like i it doesn't have teletext option
it can without any it's a very simple thing um which which you can vouch
and then you have uh what's the v video remote file which is like usually it has almost all the keys over there and
but it then it has other options like stop uh and then you play the movie or uh or fo fast forward the movie or something like that so i it has those so these are the standard uh commonly found remote controls in the uh market
mm-hmm
and then whi which is generally used by the people
and then well personal preferences i would uh basically think of having a kind of aim for the next generation thing where the we could have both the uh the f a t. v. and the remote video remote control because uh some of the keys in the video's remote control and the t. v. they could be integrated together so that uh we could um aim for the like in the f coming future um that type of uh applications with
okay
how would that work
so you've got say maybe a v. c. r. and a t. v. which are separate
so you on my one at home i've got a v. c. r. remote which then changes the channel on the v. c. r. and doesn't do anything on the t. v.
yeah
yeah
so is it gonna be like a switch on the remote that says t use the t. v. or use the v. c. r.
or does it know which one you want to use
um actually um you could you could think of um having s a y you can have a key which could tell y it could go to the video thing but um uh yo you you you still can't um in that case when it you use that the function should be able to take up the v. c. r. option and you could play it or you can also think about having like um
mm-hmm
mm-hmm
i in a few days you will be ha in in few ye coming years you might even have a system where you have a separate uh sitting setup box and uh you have uh um something like uh uh you do you do you suppose you are not able to watch some programme and actually it downloading all the time for you and uh you can just you know uh when you come back you could just switch on that thing and uh watch a program
mm-hmm
mm-hmm
mm
mm
in that case you want to browse faster browse slow you want to have those kind of functionalities
mm
mm mm mm mm mm
mm
these are kind of next generation functionalities
it's the next generation thing but it is going to come in couple of years
mm yes but i think it's i i it's already there i mean the hard disk uh recorders uh i i've seen them in the shop
mm
it's goi
yeah it's
mm
yeah
yeah
yeah
mm 'kay
so it's going to record your things and you and you you need basically the functionalities what you need in both uh uh video as well as in the standard t. v. thing
mm
yeah
that's fair enough
mm
but i don't think we're trying to make a universal remote here
no no we are not making a universal remote we are just looking at uh giving a scenario
that's yeah
i have a t. v. and tomorrow i am going to have set up box which is going to sit there and uh it's going to do that job for me
mm
mm
because y
w w w w we need to decide on on on on in how far we go to in this
mm-hmm
mean you can go pretty far i f i think with with with functions and possible uh future p uh prospects yes
mm
mm
yep
yeah
so
but it's good to keep in mind
mm
okay so that p ends my presentation
mm
very well
well
so we can always discuss about it for example uh the presently the video market actually uh this demand video over demand or what we call it as
mm-hmm
it's presently booming up actually so it i like people are providing like uh things like uh uh movies
mm
yeah
you can select actually so you want to watch a movie and uh your p your provider gives a list of movies and then you select those list
mm-hmm
yeah
and it basically you go off it downloads the movie it gives for you and then when you come you want to loo watch it on your t. v.
yeah
mm
and thi this is going to come
good
or even you don't need to download it it's streamed uh online uh yeah
yeah it can be streamed online for you and you can say what time i want to watch the movie and
yeah
yeah
mm
yeah so
um
yeah
so u um i have uh received some some some some well points of of thinking over of my account manager and uh i would like to share them with you
mm-hmm
um
mm-hmm
first thing is uh teletext is a well known feature of televisions but it's it's getting used less and less
mm-hmm
yeah
that's that's especially because of the internet of course
hmm
so we should think about it um
do we include it and do we give it a prominent uh prominent uh place on on on the on well huh
on the remote mot control itself
mm
uh as uh a in any case it's it's not used well very much but it's it is still used
mm
um
um
further yes we must think uh do we stay uh to to television only
the television as we as we all know it with with broadcasting signals and you can't go back uh-huh
or do we uh uh go further as matthew indicated by supporting uh uh recording uh devices
uh indeed indeed
so d. v. d. s and v. c. r. s
mm
and and and the hard disk recorders
um furthermore uh
w we need really need to interest uh y younger customers and then with younger customers i mean people uh below the age of forty
mm-hmm
and our our current customers are mainly forty plus uh which well forty
mm-hmm
fourteen or for o okay
so
so that's to that's i mean there's a market but uh they will grow older older and you'll al always need to have the the future with younger people
mm-hmm
um therefore
younger people like trendy trendy designs so that's w we should
make our our our r. c. as trendy as possible but
it should also be uh have a reliable image so when it looks too too spacey or too fancy people will think well does it work at all
hmm
mm
yeah it's uh well you you can follow the ideas how you want to keep the keys
you know right now if you take it you have like zero one two
three like a keys separately but suppose if you take the the present trend of mobile phones there are like big thick keys you press on the top
mm-hmm
mm
it takes one number you press on the bottom it takes another number
and uh basically uh uh so the space covered so that you don't see two separate keys there actually so it it is like uh um i i it is like uh
mm-hmm
mm
ma maybe maybe you can draw it on the on the board uh
mm
yeah so
but i think taking the idea of getting inspiration from mobile phones is interesting especially if we're going after a younger market
yeah
hmm
yes yes mo
because they are already used to that you know product
that's the the the mm the new and the funky things that's yeah
yes it's recognisable
yeah
there's lot there's lots of pretty mobile phones not too many pretty remote controls
mm mm
that's
and and they are skilled uh by using it
mm
so for example uh
well uh
mm-hmm
okay it works
fine
so for example you have uh presently uh keys like one two
mael can you hand me over this uh
yes
uh thank you
three like this actually and uh uh four five six like that and uh you can have keys like this in form like
mm-hmm
uh keys like that
okay
how much longer have we got for the meeting by the way
mm well i think fi five min mm-hmm
'cause we haven't talked about demographic at all and it's a very important issue
forty minutes
yeah so you you you can have uh keys like uh which are which are like so
too sorry so we basically don't change the uh original order of them but then the keys are more spacious
mm-hmm
they don't look uh so there there is a very sligh thing so if you press on the top it takes the one
mm
it takes the three uh four sorry four here uh five and six
mm
so the keys can be it looks you know not very much cluttered but it looks nice for you don't have too many keys but you can have a lot of options t if you press on the to
mm-hmm
mm
okay
'kay i i think now that the idea's clear
yep
yeah
mm
uh we should now uh try to decide um on our target group
yeah
which i think is quite tricky
yeah
um basically we're trying to get people to buy a remote control wouldn't they already have a remote control with their television when they buy one
of course they have already one
so our our our remote control has to be better
but it's not going to have more functionality 'cause it's only a low market it's a cheap end remote control
mm-hmm
we can't beat modern functionality we might we'll be able to beat them on th the look of it
th the design of it but that's not a big seller
if they're not just going to buy a new remote control just 'cause it looks pretty they have to actually need it as well
mm-hmm
so i'm not sure how we can get people to buy this thing
mm
i well i think many people said uh in your in in your research uh uh
mm
uh the appearance of the uh r. c. is is important when they are buying one but
yeah
but why are they buying one in the first place
indeed
so that will be about
functionality
mm
but if people are buying a new remote control for functionality they'll buy a universal remote
i've got friends who've got so many things they need a universal remote otherwise they're using five different remotes for their all their things
mm
mm-hmm
mm
in that case they wouldn't buy our product because it doesn't give them what they need in terms of functionality
so your you think we should go for a more u universal high performance
well we can't with the price range
we we're not building a universal remote we're not building a high end product
what do what do you think about what componen
yeah we have yeah twelve point five euros uh per uh per r. s r. c. and i think uh with this now you know that chips are very uh cheaps and uh we can include it in our control some new new features
mm
mm-hmm
yeah
mm
and um but yeah that's
but yeah
if we're getting into universal remote territory we're getting to l. c. d. screens and things like that which would drive the cost up a lot
i don't know
ye
i don't know whether that's necessary
is the l. c. d. screen
i don't think l. c. d. is not necessary well th for long term
for universal remotes
if you mm
i think thi this could be this could be a market because uh universal remote controls uh tend to be uh quite expensive
and quite complicated to use yes
s so we can try to go in between and offer a product which is not as expensive and not as
mm-hmm
complicated
not as flexible maybe yeah but s yeah
yeah
but but still but still people have the idea this is more functional than a normal uh uh
universal
r. c. because it has more uh it it is in some kind universal
yeah
mm-hmm
mm-hmm
but if we're going for the say fifteen to twenty five age group then not many of them would actually own t. v. s to use a remote control on
mm yes but w we're targeting i think on more on the on the twenty to forty group
okay
so they're yeah
people yes
who just have or already have a job and have the money but
mm-hmm
may not want to spend that much money on a on a universal universal control
mm-hmm
yep
i don't know really what the the price range for remote controls is
are we gonna be at the very bottom of the price range or are we kind of middle to bottom
i don't know
uh well
mm
i think uh when we think it over i thi i think we are trying to offer the a kind of universal control for for less money
mm
mm-hmm
yeah
so d do you agree
well
well i it's fine with me like the price as long as it is uh not too expensive
yeah because we have to take into account that we are gonna b we are gonna sell uh four aro around four million so when we speak about these numbers uh the price of a chip is uh price of a chip is very cheap
uh and it d uh
our provin
mm
mm
so i'm okay for designing um a ne uh less yeah a a kind of universal uh r. c. yeah
mm-hmm
you think it's possible for the twelve euro fifty
yeah
okay
um so
then we we decide on on on going to this more universal kind of control
uh yeah that's that's what we needed basically
mm-hmm
mm
mm
okay
uh that's needed right now
and uh basically you can look to the standards of other
yeah that's needed yeah
mm
and if we want to get the market we really need that
yeah
yeah
so i guess what i'd like from a universal remote is maybe choosing between three devices
actu
being able to switch between them there may be stereo v. c. r. and t. v.
yes
yeah
exactly
and just be able to s use them all from the same remote but not at the same time
yes
yeah you can also browse through all the standards you know where are the limit of standards for all of them and you can just browse through them
is that okay for you
yeah
mm mm mm mm
yeah
yeah
so given we are going for this uh
uh universal type uh m maybe it is good when you try to find out which components you therefore need and y you will try to get more specific uh user interface content and uh maybe you can look on on what trends are in this uh in this type of market
yes
mm
okay
okay
mm-hmm yep
voila
hmm
so anyone uh has a point to bring in or shall we no
so
well
oh i don't have anything right now
we can we'll we'll go and we'll i'm sure we'll up something good for the
oh that's that's fine then
okay
mm-hmm
w yes we uh we can have lunch now
yeah
mm-hmm
so um
yeah so we meet in well what are our
then th
th the next meeting will uh after lunch you have uh we have
uh thirty minutes of work and then we have the next meeting
but you will be informed via the computer
okay
okay
cool
okay perfect
so see you later
right first time this time
nu
there we go
it's not that complicated but i get it wrong every time
okay so we are just waiting for matthew
for matthew yep
mm
uh
so i suggest we start the meeting uh without matthew uh he's uh obviously late for some reason
mm-hmm
mm 'kay
good
um
today uh we will uh talk about uh conceptual design
i hope uh you both did some uh some work uh
mm-hmm
concerning a uh conceptual design
um this will be the uh agenda for
the meeting uh
uh i will
take some minutes uh again
mm-hmm
um we will have the presentations of y of you different team members and then try to come to decisions uh about the concepts uh you have presented
yep
yep
so and that uh will uh we have some uh forty minutes uh to complete this uh
mm-hmm
mm-hmm
so um who has the fir do you ha anna do you have your presentation ready
i have a presentation i'm just making this
yeah i think yeah the matthew it is it's important that matthew yeah is here because
okay
ah there is matthew
it's really a a team uh project with a team and if someone is not here then we cannot but it's okay it's good
sorry
okay i'll just email you this file my presentation
so
good
do presentation ready
mm-hmm i'm just emailing it to you
oh okay
so
so did you manage uh
yeah i sent you the slides you didn't see them
oh yes i see him good yes
okay
no
so
'kay
okay it should've gone through to you
okay mm yes i have it
mm-hmm
okay so this is just a presentation on uh the trends that we're gonna use to make the product stand out from the rest of the products out there at the moment
um can i just put this on
so we have to work out a way what we can do with our product to make it stand out and make it so people wanna buy it
um
this is to do this i will not remove my microphone
we basically used um some focus group surveys which i went through with you last time the main results of that
and um some research on the current design um and fashion trends that are out there at the moment um and as part of this
the important aspects that came out were things that we've already discussed really
the most important by far was the look and feel of it
it needs to be something that's very different from everything else out there
it needs to stand out
it needs to be not functional like the rest of the things out there at the moment
most people find remote controls boring at the moment we need to have something that looks interesting that looks exciting that will stand out
people will wanna buy it
um
that was twice as i important as the next item on here which is that it has to be technologically innovative has to have something else
apart from just the look of it
people have to then think about it and say got something there that i want
that's a really cool feature and it has to make them wanna buy it again
third on the list and again innovative was twice as important as this last um aspect it has to be easy to use
so they have to be able to be able to look at it and have some intuitive idea of how to use it um
drawing on the fashion trends at the moment uh fruit and vegetables um
this is basically talking about just the the feel of it so probably not the smell of it but the bright colours
um eye catching really bold designs and a spongy feel
mm
mm-hmm
mm
um i had a talk to the design people about this but having a remote that's tactile that feels different that would be really cool
that would make it stand out
hmm
um
so can you repeat and be more precise about what you just said
spongy feel
uh about the feeling yeah uh yo
you can
well ma make it not necessar sp spongy is the current thing
spongy is the current texture but basically there are no reports no remotes at the moment which are spongy or tactile at all
so if we make it like maybe furry or soft or something
okay
that'll be something that sets it apart rather than just bare plastic which they all are at the moment
mm
yeah
okay
so as far as the design goes the very most important aspect was the design to the customers
so going with the fruit and vegetable idea we've got the bright colours so makes it stand out
the oranges and the the bright yellows and the florescent colours part of the fruit and vegetables um
going back to the idea of taking inspiration from mobile phones
they've all got those a lot of them have the changeable covers so they can choose what colour the outside is
that's one way of looking at it um
textured feel we just talked about
maybe it's another way of doing that
mm-hmm
so if it's part of the the changeable covers then may maybe they can choose a different texture a spongy one or a soft one or something like that
so they can choose it li as they want to to maybe to fit in with their decor in their living room
yeah that's a very good idea yeah
or just what they like their sports team or whatever
yeah
um and yeah still taking the inspiration from the mobile phone design so
functionality the way the mobile phones work the way the keypad looks
also just the way that a lot of industrial design is going into mobile phones at the moment
they're big selling items
people put a lot of thought into that so we can leverage off that and we can start using some of their ideas
um back to technological in in innovation not quite as important but still a big issue
um we talked about having a way of finding a remote control if it's been lost uh that's one thing we could look at
there are other aspects like l. c. d. screens and speech recognition which weren't
i don't think in my personal opinion gonna be worth the extra expense and the extra effort that will go into them
mm-hmm
i think we're better doing something basic like this which is very important and very will be a really cool feature to put in
and
use
i had no real specific ideas for this maybe we just the basic idea of having your core functions big and at the top maybe
mm
by themselves and then yeah and then th th the finer details of buttons you don't use as much either hidden away or completely separate
yes well maybe matthew can can give some more information on the
yeah
mm
voila
yep and that's the presentation
okay good that's very clear
yeah very clear
yeah
'kay
um
so does anyone have any comments or ideas on that
uh
i think you
maybe we yes well we maybe can decide later on um the l the the look and feel of uh i've it was a good idea maybe to to
to let the people choose you mean
yes the the the there are changeable covers
yeah
but on the other hand i i don't know whether my superiors would be so glad with it because you have to introduce a complete uh uh new l line of uh of supplies uh it would be uh very complicated uh organisational
hmm
well we're selling so many units of this
this is gonna be a mass marketed product we can afford to have two or three different designs at least
hmm
mm-hmm
yeah a range of uh yeah a set of three four different aspects
yes
mm mm
mm-hmm
sure that fits the
yes and of course it will be a we we get a if it works we can get uh after sales i mean that would would be very good i mean those covers could go for for three
mm
yeah
five euro
mm
that's a very good idea um
and then uh
maybe uh we can go a th matthew's presentation because
yeah s then we could discuss later like we can put all ideas together
mm-hmm
the
together indeed uh because you ma might have some some information on the the easy to use what you were already mentioning
mm
yeah yeah i agree
it should be easier with that
yeah
mm-hmm yeah
yeah
and your part is very related to mine because when you suggest something then it has to be integrated inside
so
yeah
yeah so i'll i'll go with that actually so um
mm-hmm
okay so m so then the the idea of uh having a remote is generally you have uh different keys and uh different structures different forms
and uh they could be like buttons or like and um they could be of uh a varying sizes if you want to to uh basically emphasize a particular key more than the other
and uh maybe like you can have different colours for example having the r red for the on off switching on and off the button
so this this is the general trend to ha the method they do
yeah
mm-hmm
so what i have found was that uh currently uh the they are mostly that the t. v.
v. c. r. music system operated ones actually and they are very specific to each other
but there are some common keys for example if you want to follow the v. c. r. and if you want to follow the uh g uh s some uh soundtrack on the w w see they have the common thing actually you can have and uh
mm
there is also um a speech recognition to store channel information names like you can basically if you have a multiple functionality say t. v.
v. c. r. or something i say it to the t. v. and the t. v.
mm
and you can programme the keys if you want to certain keys are even the channel information
mm
i like the idea though of having speech recognition for like the n the name of a channel like b. b. c.
rather than having to remember the the number of it on the keypad
yeah yeah so you you you can just uh because uh as more and more channels come then you have more and more problems to remember the v v exact channel numbers ex exactly
that's a good idea
mm
yeah
even if you arrange it by however you arrange it you still have the problem to remember exactly which channel you want to
hmm
mm
yeah i really like that idea
so what functionalities do you suggest for that
for facing this problem
so it it it's like it limited one
in the present market i saw it that says something like they are looking for eighty word thing
eighty word which shouldn't be th that difficult to implement like eighty to hundred word
mm-hmm
basically you want you don't want to store all the channels in the remote control you want to st store your favourite channel
mm
maybe ten channels yeah at the most
yeah some ten twelve channel information
you know you don't want to st store all the hundred channel information into that
okay
mm
and uh basically uh it depends like the remote with l. c. d. display for browsing because you have multiple functionalities for example you are watching a movie
and uh uh you are having a universal remote control and you want to uh you don't know really which functionality is now
so i am using the t. v. so
every time i use it it could be like for example i can use a simple toggle switch
and a display so i press it so the display says okay i'm in t. v. or d. v. d. or whatever it is
mm-hmm
mm-hmm
instead of having three keys separately for four keys to model the functionalities will increase actually
oh yeah yeah yeah mm
mm
mm
and for you and you might want you don't want separate keys for all of them
mm
you can't
and uh well there can be children friendly where you can programme your remote so that they they are not allowed uh to browse certain channels which you can block them
and you can operate them
mm-hmm
so these are the things presently which are seen in the market scenarios at present
i personally would look at things like having a u universal remote is uh um is a good idea
like instead of having unusual ones for all of them you can think of having um with multiple functionality possibly with speech recognition
mm-hmm
i got a mail from the the coffee machine interface unit that uh they have uh integrated the s speech recognition into a into the coffee machine
and so if you say hello coffee machine it say hi joe or something like that you know and uh
mm b
but a coffee machine there's not too many words they'd be using with that it's a it's a small vocabulary
yeah you you won't be using it so it's a limited vocabulary mm thing and very isolated word and it's uh it is interesting
mm
mm
and basically storing the channel through voice or other ways of programming your keys
mm
on the display for the browsing which is again and maybe having something like a blinking thing
like uh it could indicate you're uh it it could indicate what is cal like the uh whether uh you you have enough battery in your in your uh remote
mm
yeah
the blinking
at the same time if it's a dark room it can be used to locate the remote also or
and you want okay for coming back to one point y you want to let the user to programming the keys
two thirty five supposed to finish
some of them
yeah you can let them to do that
and uh isn't that too difficult for the we want w i don't know if we still want the um r. c. to be easy to use that's the compromise
hmm
n no but the if you give it d depends on the easiness like the user how much effort he can put
yeah
hmm
like for example uh i would like to store in certain way
so if you want to give the full freedom to the user or you want to keep some constraints and let the user use it with that constraint
mm
yeah
yeah
mm
yeah
i think you can do it both ways
so it de
you can have it so it's easy they can pick it up and use it straight away without doing anythi without customizing it
a standard
yeah
or if they want to they have the option of using these extra features
um yes but but i do maybe you can give a hand to us because i i'm not sure whether that that we can implement that for twelve euro and fifty cents
so
yeah
so
i'm sorry to have
hmm
every time i have to come down on this price again to so this might be a little limiting for your creativity but it's it's it's the real
hmm
hmm
we have to consider it
s so do we think these ideas an and my uh sp speech recognition
yeah
i mean maybe it's possible for for twelve euro but then then it will be at cost of other functionality we might implement like the uh uh the the the furry uh uh case of the
mm
hmm
mm-hmm yeah like i would say that for programming uh keys you said
yeah
uh it could be uh easily uh done within the the package of twel twelve euros
mm
yeah
but for the a. s. r. system uh i'm not sure if it's feasible to have this or
we well we can still look at we can talk with the coffee unit and you can uh check how much how much they yeah yeah yeah
we
exactly yeah i if if it's a low vocabulary it's already implemented and w how much it's cost maybe with a f cheap chip
mm
maybe we can come we we can talk to them and we can come with that you know
mm mm
yeah
and also well you can think of having uh since you have a you know something maybe if you added little bit of display
you might need the to che keep checking the battery
so you really need a some kind of indicator so it could be a blinking option of l. e. d. it could actually be used to detect also
hmm
hmm
yeah
if it's in a dark room you can basically detect it also
mm
hmm
yeah
hmm
so
mm
i like the idea too of being able to use the remote in the dark
so either having the buttons so you can feel the difference between them or if they if they light up or something
no actually i if i it is like you know it tells you um it can be for two purposes
mm
like if you have an l. c. d. display and all those things it's not going to be the standard remote
mm
hmm
which is having uh which need just uh six six volt uh th sorry three volts um of d. c.
mm
it may need more actually so y you you may need to check your battery usage it and then you need that
mm
some functionality to indicate the battery limit
hmm
it's true
and then if the battery limit is indicated
if it could be ind indicated through a blinking something and it can change the colour depending on your uh how much is the battery
mm
well that is good enough to even locate even if you want to
mm-hmm
you know
'kay good
yeah so
i don't know how if if i have time to talk about the
mm yes um i would
you you have time some more
yep
yes yes you can you can still
okay
sure you can you know
we have time
so what i'm gonna present here is very uh um yeah basic knowledge about the all the the components that are inside a a r. c. a remote control
mm-hmm
and how is it manufactured h what is the process just to explain you
so the method is ther there is a a set of components in a in a remote control like
and uh what cost the the components in themself do not cost a lot but the the way to assemble everything costs obviously
and i will uh show you my preferences uh uh at the end
so there are two uh different types of uh um
nice
two different ways of using the the components for making a a remote control
hmm
uh the basic way is to use a an integrated circuit and some uh transistors with an that aims at communicating uh uh the message and to to send the message to the um to the led that will uh transmit to the receiver
and uh yeah the other components and the circuit board buttons infrared led etcetera for the components um
so you finding just to say that the chip can detect uh when a key is pressed and then it translate to the key
to a sequence something like morse code as you know uh with a different sequence for each key
mm-hmm
mm-hmm
and uh uh that's with the components we will use we will have different uh messages different sequences
and the chips sends that signal signal to the transistor that amplify to make it stronger um
so electronic parts are assembled onto uh printed boards uh because it's easier to mass produce and assemble
and uh so i think for our design we want some b uh programmable uh you know v. v. l. s. i. or f. p. g. a. uh high technology
yeah mm mm-hmm
and this is important and also we'll use uh yeah like in any uh high tech uh devices a chip of fi fibreglass to them and connect them
mm-hmm
so my personal design we need to find a solution what um what is the material of the cover we want to use
if it's plastic or you said that yeah you had some ideas uh like fruit veg or i dunno
mm
well well m m maybe m maybe we can give the uh the uh the case a very uh uh normal a v very normal case but
yes
yes
with the changeable covers to fancy it up
mm-hmm
so like a normal cheap plastic case which can be covered up in for instance a wooden case
mm-hmm
yeah
yes
i mean just what
mm just have a yeah
yeah like they do in with cars i think
yeah inside the car yeah
just the veneer on it yeah
so they also emailed me that uh they have available a bunch of different buttons a scroll wheels integrated push buttons s such as a computer mouse
yeah
and uh very cheap l. c. d. s so liquid crystal displays so i'm wondering i think we might be able to integrate l. c. d. into our r. c.
and the final point okay is um we have yeah there are some uh compromise to to do
hmm
so we have to know that the push button requires a simple chip
but the scroll wheel uh and that kind of higher high tech stuff needs more money um which is a higher price range alright
and the display requires an advanced chip which in turns is more expensive than the regular chip
but i think uh with twelve euros um and if it's uh uh made for mm four million uh items
mm-hmm
then i think w we could be able to handle that
so to to sum up um
we need yeah so i i just said that the components uh the list of components uh has to be uh yeah listed and um and um assembly is a an important process that has to be taken into account
and uh for the designing of the cove uh uh cover layout then it's better to to to maybe see that with uh the the u. r. exp u. r. i. expert so that we can it's really a team working uh
sorry
mm
mm
so i i cannot design something without your agreement right
yeah so of course for example uh i wanted to know like if you want to have a a fo if you want to have the l. c. d. display over there
no of course
yes
or if you want to store a programmes with a keys
what kind of things you'll need inside your thin inside
w wh what
yeah it's kind of um simple pro progra programmable device and we have to insert
w what
okay
i think we could insert one that could underlie several functions of
okay
okay so in that case you can even look at the technology what the mobile phone is trying to use with the card
exactly yeah for customizing and yeah
yeah where they do all the wi with with them actually
okay
how f cost effective it would be to put that car chip into it and do the programmable things
yeah
so
yeah good idea
so i f i think we we should come to some decisions now uh a about this
yeah
um so i understand uh when we want a display we need a expensive chip
but when we want a scrolling wheel w we also need the expensive chip so can we use same chip so with one expensive chip
we can uh implement several complicated uh or advanced features
exactly yeah that's a very good idea we could have uh one main chip uh that could handle uh it's called f. p. g. a. chip
yes
mm-hmm
mm-hmm
mm-hmm
that could handle both uh like scrolling wheels as well as uh l. c. d. and yeah
so when the more expensive chip you mentioned there is is possible in the in the given budget uh maybe we should go for for the more expensive chip
so all features uh which you mentioned can be implemented based on the same chip
yes
d well
do you think that's feasible
well i don't know if it'll fit into our cost of twelve point five euro you know
uh
you th you think it's possible
is it possible to fit in to that
yeah also thinking i think both uh if we had a budget of twenty twenty uh euros it will be okay but uh
sorry
hmm
well maybe we need specific costings then
actually do maybe two designs and then cost them out and see which one is gonna fit in our budget better
yeah that's an excellent idea
mm yes wh when you make a a design ca you can next meeting you can give an quite an exact cost price
yeah yeah
that w that would be a very good idea
mm
yeah because right now i don't have price in in head but for next meeting i'm sure yeah be able to do that
mm
good good
yeah that's uh that's something which i wanted to ask you also like what will be the each individually the cost of it
yeah
for example if f if you want to put wood i wouldn't suggest for wood uh 'cause it's i think it's m
okay
much easier to use a plastic or a rubber rather than wood
i agree on that
mm
yeah
it will be much ch much expensive th though it's the most natural thing but
yes but i can i think uh i think we can just use more cheap plastic for a kind of basic edition
and then people can fancy it up with with more expensive materials which which come with a with another price
yeah
hmm
yeah it's uh
yeah we we can give a preference to them
but it is but with plastic or the rubber or whatever it is it's much better with that rather than going for
do do you agree
yeah but i it's a detailed uh yeah yeah uh plastic versus uh wood
mm yeah sure
yeah
and we need maybe to centre our description on uh the the really the what buttons what uh functionality we want to offer to the user
yeah
and maybe with uh graphs or i don't know uh user interface designer you could maybe uh help us on that
ma i i think uh for next meeting we c you two can present a real design
yeah
yea
mm-hmm
okay
uh so drawing it on the board
perfect yeah
and then we now sh only have to t to decide the general function uh
so um
let let's say next meeting w you produce two designs one one
yeah sure
yeah we will uh
one less advanced and one more advanced and with the cost price
yeah
yeah
mm
uh furthermore we go for the for the uh basic plastic case which can be later uh fancied up with uh
uh
with addit uh additional uh how do you call them these like like mobile telephones you can put a cover over it
mm
yeah
but that that that that can be done later
yeah customized
we now can concentrate on the on the basic remote control
mm
um
okay
we can give them smooth keys you know
smooth keys
with bigger s uh
so that you know
the the problem most of the time we've seen the keys is that it's small
yeah
mm
and every time we have to be very but if i the if we if we go to a different ways of designing those keys
then you can merge them together to
so is there any of these that you're looking at particularly or is this just ideas
oh you can actually for example if you see they are they are they are quite small over here and uh now you can
mm-hmm
for example as i was if you make them big it may change the look of the thing also to the people
hmm
mm
at the same time it is m more uh like it would be more interesting for people who are having this r. s. i. and all problem
mm
mm-hmm
mm yeah
yes yes yes bi big keys is is good thing i think
uh big keys may better for them actually and uh
you see
i agree yeah and not too m too many keys of course yeah
yeah
no no
mm well one i've had before
yeah
a r r remote control we have at home is one that's actually got a cover on the bottom so the bottom bit is just
covers half the keys most of the time and then you can slide the cover back to get to the the more advanced keys
mm mm mm
mm w but then you have still have uh when you don't use it you have such a a an extent of your remote control which you don't use
yeah
mm
so maybe it's possible uh i don't know whether you can can indicate this
that you can elsewhere open your remote control and on the inside are uh buttons you don't use that much
yeah
mm
yeah
um yeah i've seen that before too
yeah
anoth another like b it flips up and then you've got another layer of buttons underneath
yes
yes
yeah so it's something like this the model here s you can put the keys
mm
mm
but i've seen also with keys and buttons on the top of here as well
that's what you mean
yes i i th that's what i mean so i mean something
yeah
yeah
like like a book
i like this one
i like the shape of this one
yeah
can we have can we think about maybe having a a non recta non non rectangular one so with not just the straight little box that's a maybe curved or something
yeah i like also this one
yeah
yeah mm
the point is w maybe we need to also to make a decision on how how how big we want to be and how many buttons like n we should dec decide numbers or
mm mm 'kay
we should make a
is this for the next meeting though
i think we might be out of time out of time for this meeting
mm
yeah that yeah next meeting we should be
okay
ju just make two designs
yeah that would depend upon us actually
yeah yeah yeah
and the we we can decide decide between th those designs
yep
yeah okay
i think that would be a good idea
perfect
so anyone uh any questions for now
no no
no
i don't have
so is this is there anything else i need to do from a marketing point of view for the next meeting
um yes i come to that uh uh
maybe it would be interesting if you could look um
for the cost inventories of other devices if you're using speech recognition or something like that
yes well m maybe uh i don't know whether that's possible maybe you can start evaluating uh their work somehow
mm
okay well is this me designing a way to evaluate it so
thinking about how to set up test groups and things
i don't know whether that's possible uh in the given time but a as far as possible
mm
okay
so uh you two will be together w working on a o on two prototypes
yep
exactly
mm
yeah
and further instructions will be uh will be sent to you by uh by email
two or three prototypes
two
two
two
one for like cost and the one with like higher end so that then we can be easily comparing them or you know find a compromise between both of them
i
okay
mm and then
mm
yeah and find maybe a compromise
hmm
hmm
yes okay
yeah that's how it is
perfect yeah
mm-hmm
yep
okay let's call this to an end
mm 'kay
okay
thanks guys
thanks
so we are done
for now
did you get my email with the slides
ah
tricky
i guess i have to change the pen otherwise
will be completely different
dunno
maybe they're supposed the pen's supposed to go over the seats
might be seat floor rather than person
yeah put it back
yeah
and do you think it's
yep
okay
yeah
jo's making faces at me
yeah
so
matthew is uh late again
mm-hmm
probably an important man
um
so well it is important for him to be here uh
yeah
so what can you
he he he
you did work together didn't you
yeah we will yeah so i will be able to to summarize uh our meeting
but still i think uh it would be in very important if the uh as um main designer
yes
i think we can put on the here
yes
yes
uh basically w yeah we we designed the two uh items
mm
um yes but w we
um can we have a phone can someone
yes maybe we should phone him
it's really w well designed
um well
mm
um when he is not here we will just we just have to continue
mm object tracking
um so just for record i i will take uh notes again
yeah
okay
and um
well first thing uh i was uh uh i got an email from uh from my superior again that we really should stay within the budget of the uh twelve euro and fifty cents
'kay
it's uh well he said to me well uh
when you stay in it's good when you don't stay in you have to redesign
there is no uh no negotiation uh possible in this matter
so we have to consider that
good
yep
um
so maybe anna you can have your presentation
well we can't no we can't do evaluation 'til we have a design
okay matthew
nice uh you are here
great
great
great
oh ma maybe then you can start now with mm presenting your uh your designs
yep
so i will start by the the basic one that uh
fits into uh eight euros actually right seven eight euros
mm-hmm
and uh well first for both they have um a special shape maybe the designer can uh explain better than me but uh it's like a surf board
and you you are supposed to surf to browse to surf t. v. maybe the web
mm 'kay
and uh it's kind of interesting shape because um unconsciously people want to s to surf when they see this stuff
or browse
and also it's not too far from um a mobile
mm
mm-hmm
so people are used to that kind of shape right
mm
mm-hmm
don't take care too much about the colour because w yeah we don't take yeah
now we are supposed to give some oper offers right now
so here would be basically the the the infrared uh uh led yeah l. a. l. a. l. e. d.
i yeah
eye
mm-hmm
l. e. d.
the on off button in red
mm-hmm
here would be the volume
oh yeah
on the on the left okay so easy to turn on t and off
uh-huh
mm-hmm hmm
yes
and um so this is a very cheap version so there are maybe you can carry on uh matthew
also so you have uh uh browsing the channels actually so you can go up and down the channels
mm-hmm
yeah
uh if you have a video or something you can forward back
how can you change from v. c. r. to uh t. v. by the way
oh no no no this is a single this this is a model with just the t. v. one
okay yeah
no no just sorry this is a standard t. v. one we are not talking about that
yeah yeah
ah okay
so and then we have usually there twelve keys but we know that we rel that we have only ten digits
mm-hmm
the extra two are for uh having or giving an option for uh having more than one channel
and the other one is for the teletext or something you want to browse through from that
yeah
mm-hmm
okay so it's it's t a very basic remote then it's only
actually
it's a very basic minimal thing which you can which is which is also available in the market
mm
yeah
yeah
yeah
actually that's what it that it i and would cost us to build it about eight euros
mm
mm
seven eight ei eight euros
exce except for the for the special shape the surfing board it has a quite a a conventional layout of buttons uh
yeah
yeah
yeah
so this one model and uh yeah
can i see
thanks
sure
okay i like the volume control that's good
th this is a magic one but i know we don't want to talk about that you know like uh i i i it is a very futuristic
it's like uh it's like a brain machine interface and all this stuff we are thinking about in the future it can come
uh-huh
yeah
so it doesn't actually have buttons
so that uh then what we look t yeah
did you wanna see
mm-hmm
yeah no you can carry on i just
this is a model yeah
look how it feels all
yes it really feels like like like a mobile phone
mm
yeah
yep
just i'm i really want to talk to it
yeah actually yeah
but
it won't talk back
so but but continue with your uh mm-hmm
uh so well then the this is the a more a little uh smooth and it gives a lot of functionality
uh in this way so all we have uh th you see there are only six keys
but don't worry they are ma they are doing the job of twelve keys actually here
right
mm
and so they have more space actually and uh it's easy to uh use this and uh you have um so this is a standard uh uh infrared eye
mm-hmm
and then you have a power button which l volume what you have
mm-hmm
and then other than that you have uh channel up and down and uh f slow pause or s slow lo yeah s pause or stop
play pause
and uh then uh you can uh you have a l. c. d. display
mm-hmm
here and uh y this is a functional thing which can change like it's a toggle switch which could change the function say y you press it
from d. v. d. player to television or something
yeah
exactly yeah
i really can change it so
yes
to audio and to video on demand
mm
instead of having many switches y
mm-hmm
yes and and and then you get feedback via the l. c. d. yeah
the l. c. d. can display what is that on that and uh well you can have a integrated microphone over here or in the button th here
yes
mm-hmm
this is the orange button the microphone
so which can uh basically you want to do a speech recognition and uh that channel a lot of information can be di displayed here directly on the um on your on your display
mm-hmm
an yeah
and here is a small l. e. d. which is like blinking one which tells you like uh are you running out of the battery
mm-hmm
and which is can be useful for the locating as i was talking earlier okay
yeah
mm-hmm
and uh well then we have a cover basically basically you don't need much of the time this
yeah
when you need you can use it and this gives additional functionality that tomorrow you want you can add a tactile thing
crazy dis designer okay
to this cover you know
mm
design enter
yeah but but but but uh i in there uh when this is closed will it also uh cover up the l. c. d. screen
yeah
yeah yeah yeah yeah
yeah
it's basically to do that
yeah
but but the l. c. d. screen i mean is a very uh
well an eye attracting feature which shouldn't be shouldn't be
actually when you are watching the t. v. when you are watching anything or listening to them you hardly care about what is getting displayed here you know
oh actually well
uh you want to uh and this gives a protection to the l. c. d. actually giving a cover to that actually
that th that's true
mm
gives a protection because when it falls down or something
it it is it is is is it gives a protec it's more robust that way
mm-hmm
mm-hmm
yes
yes more robust
yes okay
mm
uh yeah
and you have very good chances
it's low weight
you have to see yeah yeah the the components we put inside is very low weight
yeah
mm-hmm
yeah
so the the cost is actually a bit more it's uh it's it's sixteen francs
it
sixteen euros
sixteen euros sorry
okay
so it's well outside the budget then
then it's out of budget
but the the main point we we talk about that with our uh manufacturer
but w
and they say basically that the s. r. system would be uh something like three francs per item so three euros sorry
yeah
three euros
and um
that's on top of the sixteen or is it part of that
no no no part of that yeah
part of that
so that takes it down to thirteen euros without the speech recognition
yeah yeah
mm 'kay
yeah
hmm
mm-hmm
well uh if you we can have if you have new more ideas we can add new more uh some more keys if you want to you know
mm-hmm
well i think th th yeah we should stick with uh a number of keys because if we add too much then
mm
yeah it it should not be cluttering up everything
mm-hmm
it's too
what's this one on the side
ah that's for the it's kind of a l. e. d. for indicating your battery and as well as it's like a blinking one you know you can keep it aside
locati
location
ah okay
mm-hmm
yeah
mm 'kay
i like the shape of them i do like the
yeah
the size and the the shape
well well
mm
be before ta talking about the money and what's possible and what is not possible maybe anna you can uh give our uh give us your um
mm-hmm
okay
and maybe we run the evaluation on both of the products both of these two
yes
evalua evaluation and also the evaluation criteria so what what is important to look at
okay
basically this is what we've talked about already um from the marketing point of view
mm-hmm
we just wanna make sure that we've taken into account yep
well just
do it quickly if if we al already
so it's just a shortlist of criteria on um the things that we've identified as being important to selling the product
mm-hmm
um we just go through these and rate them as a group and then at the end we'll make an evaluation based on that
so just average the score of those items so
these are the things we identified as being important
um the three things were look and feel innovation and ease of use
mm-hmm
were the three important components um appealing to the correct demographic so using those things in the right way to appeal to our demographic
and then goin following the company motto following the fashion trends and putting that into the product as well
so well do you wanna go through and put through those on the the two products now or do we wanna discuss them further and then evaluate them
um n no why not why not discuss uh discuss it now
okay
so f just go through onto the whiteboard i guess
not sure how this is gonna come out
so the first one was really very far below budget
would you want to take the price down of the end product according to that or just have the high profit on it
'cause if we're only going to make it for eight euros then we have a
mm well my my personal view is uh w when when this one is eight euros we must think how can we improve it
mm-hmm
and then i mean w w w you must just see it we can still spend this four and a half euro and
mm-hmm
yep
to r because th th th the the selling price is already prite fik uh uh quite fixed on twenty five euros
mm-hmm
mm-hmm
so we just have to offer as much as as well value for the for the customer uh he can have for twenty five euro
functionality
okay so look and feel innovation
and now it easy to use
easy to use
mm
target
mm-hmm
and trends
oh you following the idea of using the um removable covers on these
is that part of both of them or
um well w w we can still discuss that
okay
so um
and together with evaluating this uh we we might come with new ideas i mean adding things or uh removing uh of options because they are too expensive but
mm-hmm
mm-hmm
um
i've received uh a framework which we can do this
i mean did you have this this excel sheet
mm-hmm
no
no
no okay this is these are the the the latest prices of our production uh uh production unit for several components
no
so we can uh see whether the the price is is within the twelve euro uh fifty cents uh
mm-hmm
okay
so maybe we can start with this uh calling this one
okay
yep
so it's the pink
th th this is the first design
and the other one's green
yes
okay so look and feel
where um one is i've broken the pen again
uh there is another pen
s yeah
get that one
um w one's bad and seven's the best
sorry one's true and seven's false
one's the best
okay
so on a scale of one to seven
'kay
okay
so
look and feel
well you already feel that uh pretty much i think
in i in my opinion
mm-hmm
purely feel is is is very good is very good in your hand so i i i would consider two or or may maybe even one for feel
mm-hmm yeah
mm-hmm
mm-hmm
but that's just half we should also consider look and then
mm-hmm
i it looks
quite conventional
mm
don't you agree
mm yeah
on the scale u it's between functional and fancy basically we're looking at so
so maybe two
hmm
hmm
ma ma ma ma maybe say say five
i it's my opinion but i don't know what what
well i will give it maybe we have anyways the way we have designed it's like the surf as you say you know
mm-hmm
yeah
it though the look is fine but uh still i will give four in that case you know
yeah
four maybe
four
four yeah that
four four
okay
now we th th then we settle on four
mm-hmm
yeah
i will gi yeah
uh
'kay
can you maybe fix the other
yeah
mm
if you press like this not like this then you
no that's the ink's dried
no
c can you get the batteries
no no the battery has fallen down that's i
battery's low isn't it the ink
the b that's the that that one
yeah
battery there
but
no no it's not that it's how to close a battery
okay
okay
now it should be
mm
no i think it's lost a battery
mm try it just try it
no it's it would still write but it wouldn't pick it up with the sensors
oh it will not ri mm mm
is there another battery there
oh yeah
you got a second
try a
well we won't be able to tell
yes it it has a mm
perfect
is that working
did it come out
good
okay
good
good
because we'll be able to see it still even if it wasn't working
it's just a normal whiteboard marker but it wouldn't be picked up on the the actual whiteboard
yeah yeah
yep
okay
so then then
and the other one
wow
ah
i think it's slightly better um
mm
it's hard to tell from just the plasticine but
i i
i
when we want to include i i i'm doubting about this this component
it it it it breaks in your
mm
'kay maybe
no actually this is this is not going to protrude actually it it's n i it is jus
mm
okay
it's not a button it's a led it's a
it's a led actually which which 'll be covering in a curve
ac actually yeah it should be embedded
mm yes i see mm okay
it's will be embedded there so it won't be really you know protruding or something
mm-hmm
yeah
yeah
oh you can push push it again you can push it
yeah
the other thing is is the left hand one protruding
yeah
'cause if people are left handed they want to use the other hand maybe it won't work so well
yeah
yeah
no you it it not protruding actually it will go in better into that
okay
well r r
i'd say two or three for that one personally
mm
probably more towards three than two
i think the look is better but the feel is is is worse
so so i would also say this is four
okay
but w w do you what do you think
uh it's fine i think
my just that um the feel is that um
you right now you you don't see the feel because right uh for example if you press it quite inside now like this now it's embedded one
yeah
mm
mm
yes
this is how embedded one will
yes it basically is the same shape
yeah
it's a bas basically the same thing actually
mm-hmm
you will be except that in this c
mm
and the l. c. d. makes it better
yeah
yeah
and you might have a slight thing for to forward and
yeah
yeah
mm okay
yeah
so i will say two
yeah it's d it's definitely more fancier than that one
yeah yeah
yes okay
i would say two three
okay
yeah
so consensus
two or three
two
mm
two
yep
two's good yes
looking like
um 'kay
innovation
the first one not really muc
basically there is no innovation in the first one compared to what exists in the market right
mm
yeah
no but except for the design of the surf
do we
yeah
the surf uh design
mm
mm
what what features are we actually including
you should be rea
are we including like a location kind of thing like trying to find it
uh no i think it's more of the feel
there's nothing like that
but th is there any there's no actual innovation in that at all it's just a straight out remote control
yeah yeah
yeah
mm-hmm
yeah
mm-hmm
okay
the only innova innovation is the shape
yeah
say about that
okay
s so that
so there's no this uh look and feel thing though that's not a technological innovation
yeah
yeah
you're right
so i'd be up for seven for innovation
yeah
and the
and the second one is really uh state of the art uh in terms of innovation
yep
mm
and um with many more functionalities and can open and close the the bottom part
yeah it gives it
yes
a and the l. c. d. screen is
yeah
that's that's that's well it's quite innovative
and all the scrolling uh buttons and menu and pro programmable device behind this
mm
uh could put it at one or two i would say
okay
yeah
personally
mm
yep
mm
mm
mm
so what is it what are the innovations with this
got the l. c. d. screen
uh
yeah automatic speech recognition
is that in this one though
is this 'cause this is the
no we ha
th th there were different options we discussed then we discussed the one that was in budget and the one that was out of budget
we just diske discuss it as you designed it and then we will will try to get it in the budget
okay
yeah
so the cost for these were what was the cost for the first one
so
eight euros
eight
eight
well actually we have yeah to check again yeah
yeah eight euros yeah
and this one was sixteen euros
yes
sixteen
sixteen euros
okay
so
innovation for this one is two
one
it's a two i would say two
two
w w un to be one what would do we nee actually yeah i don't see okay one would would be without buttons
two
why it is one
a man w w
mm
yeah
well the speech recognition is a very good innovation i believe it so
yes
bu
yeah
so maybe we can put one
this this is it w with the speech recognition
it's using speech recognition yeah
okay yeah
well
gi given that that it works then it's i think one
give it a one
yeah one yeah
yep
okay
ease of use
uh
so the first one is really standard so everybody i including our grandmothers can use it right
mm
he is used to it act
yeah
mm
they are used to it actually
yep
so that's maybe a a two for ease of use
yeah
here there may
um the other one is quite easy tho though
uh though it has more functionality i think it shouldn't be for the user to learn it actually
okay
hmm
it shouldn't be diffi
so maybe a three or a four
uh yeah actually in fact i think it will be yeah
one me um we hope maybe sometimes people get uh scared with the number of buttons
mm
yeah but y
and there is a like i would say three
or maybe four
okay
well we have reduced the keys actually you see
consensus
three or four
three i would
three is fine with me
yeah yeah because it's n uh it's not like a big one with uh one hundred buttons or so
three
three
okay
yeah it's a actually the user has to put some effort to do use that actually it's not so easy like this one the normal
no
mm-hmm
yeah
yes but then when when he is used to it i i it is quite easy
is quite easy yeah
so so i think th three is good
initially there there is a lot of effort yeah
yeah
okay
good
what's the next
so three's uh how well it goes to the target demographic
mm
so we're d we're still thinking twenty to forty year olds
so
twe twenty to forty yes that's
that's
this one would be uh for grandmothers
mm
oh no this would i i would i would give this model to the old people actually
no
yeah grandmothers yeah
yeah
mm-hmm
so sh completely changed our demographic there it's not part of the the funky young thing
and
well exce except for the surfing shape
yeah that's true
i mean that's that's something which which has an appeal on this group i think but
yeah
yeah
if it was the very bottom price range or it was like between this and another one we did the same thing then i can imagine it being applying to the the demographic yeah
yeah
that's it's still ye
mm w w w we after this we can can consider uh for instance making this more attractive to to the demographic
mm
'cause we have got room we've got some budget there to add a few things to it that's right
mm
but as it is now i w would say
mm six something
yeah
mm-hmm
oh yeah
do you agree
and
i well i think
yeah because it's so important it's i it was written that it really so important
the um the the look and uh taking care of its it targets the right range of people right
yeah
mm
uh yeah but but if you sell it in the market it's going to be cheap actually
yeah
but w
but it's going to be cheap whatever though it was set with i we've got a set price
so
and people can still decide to use the cheaper one
yeah
instead of a
but for us it's yeah we have a constraint that we need to sell at twenty five euros
mm yeah indeed
yeah
there's nothing that would make me spend an extra k few euros on that one rather than another one
th t t
yeah
ju just think twenty five euros i mean it's not going to be cheaper
okay
okay
so in that case well it's fine then
yeah
we can yeah
mm
okay
mm
okay
um and the demokraphi demographic of the second one
and the demographics of
it's got the got the the toys in it it's got the l. c. d. screen and
yeah tha tha tha tha tha that's i think it's better because of the l. c. d. screen which is really an appeal on the on the on the
mm
yeah
on the and on the
yeah
and if you want to target yeah if we we wish to to sell four millions of this i think for this audience we need absolutely the l. c. d. screen
mm-hmm
mm
so the l. c. d. screen uh attracts yes
yeah
because it
i think especially if we're gonna n have an l. c. d. screen on a low range product then that's good
yeah
mm ma maybe that's something to consider yes so
mm
okay
wh what what
i'd probably go with three again for that one
yeah i think it's uh it has more market actually
or even
even one and two
mm-hmm
y yeah you know two
no s say t two
or two
okay
so two yeah
two
yeah
two yeah
yeah two yeah
because tomorrow this will be more appealing because you can add lot of sophistication on that
mm-hmm
because then you you have it uh d you have lot of things which you can include for the people to
yeah
yep
and especially i guess 'cause this has the speech recognition as well and that makes it more appealing it's more of a a new fun toy
we have to practically test it
the field test will tell you how good
mm-hmm
yeah
okay
okay the final point trends
and following the trends
the trends
so the trends were the fruit and vegetables and the spongy feel
mm
mm
so as it is not really doing either of them
i think
spongy
uh that means that it goes in in the water
mm-hmm
well the spongy could be part of the the feel of the buttons as well
i know some have you tried the mobile phones that have got the kinda spongy buttons and not not exactly spongy but i'm thinking one of the nokias that's got like you ca it hasn't got individual buttons it's got just a one bit on it and so you can that feels kinda spongy
uh okay
mm
yeah i know
but this one includes this feature right
spongy buttons
yeah
we we we we we yeah it's the way they are going to be actually
so it's sort of yeah
mm
so
okay
mm
uh the maybe in the colour we can make it uh fruit and and veggie
but that's if you're using the covers
and the then we can al yes
yeah
or is it just one
we can we can consider uh uh is it possible do you think to to make a cover
for s such a phone
i mean
well they make it for mobiles it can't be that much more complicated
but why do you want to cover that actually
in that uh w in the mod
well just with the with the flexible plastic uh
so you got the option of having different colours or different textures
yeah
this is possible
i th i th i think
uh uh y are you sure
yeah i think yeah it should be possible like what we do with the mobile phone yeah
o o or just two things which can be put on each other
mm
yeah exactly like nokia phones
mm
yes exactly like it
yep
uh so
maybe we can but we have to decide it we can put the the the fancy f look of vegetables for instance
mm-hmm
to to these covers and s now try to invest in the in in the features
i think the if we do the cover that's really going with the company's philosophy of having the fashion in in electronics
it lets people have the latest fashion even next year when fruit and vegetables might be out
mm
you'll still be able to put a new cover on it and then it'll still be in fashion
mm mm mm mm mm
yeah
'cause sometimes look at this computer th this laptop it's all black and uh it's quite conventional
mm
and sometimes people don't like too much flashy colours like this one presented here
mm
mm
so maybe we could do like in the range the set of what we propose a black one
mm
yep
mm-hmm
very standard one that meets the the requirements of th such people that want really standard uh things
mm-hmm
yep
mm
mm
mm
and then you have the option of having the different colours different covers
yes
so so so that that would make the trends equal so we we we really have don't have
yeah
mm
there's n yeah
'cause that's the that's the feature that could be included in either of them
i mean
mm
although it is more with the spongy buttons on the um
yeah so a a point better for the for the number two
yes indeed
on the other one
okay
so
two and three or one and two
yes
yeah it's one
say say one and two
one and two
mm-hmm
okay
so le le let's see
so d this one has spongy but buttons
okay
yeah it says a
yeah the blue one uh spongy
mm i see yes okay
okay so the average of that is
good
three six nine divided by five so five
just add it
nine
you know
one point six one point
mm
three six seven
nine by five one point s eight
one point eight yeah
this one eleven thirteen nineteen twenty one divided by five is four point two yep
four point
uh four point two
very good
okay
but we still got a very different price for those two so they're not really comparable yet anyway
mm-hmm
we we must try to get them closer
yeah it's right yeah that's right
yep
both in i i or we just have to choose
wow
and adapt
because
yep
when we choose for this one we have to we have to make it more attractive and w when we to d for this one we have to make it more cheap
mm-hmm
well it's easier to just make that one cheaper by just taking the speech recognition out
that'll basically take us down to the budget
yes well
but i'm now did y did you work with the same prices that i have here
so i i give yeah i just give a call with the manufacturer uh and uh i explained them and they told me this could be possible for sixteen fr euros
mm
uh unfortunately we didn't see this chip uh matthew so maybe we have to recap with this one
yeah
yep
mm tha
maybe we ought to reconsider everything with this yeah
well yes well uh re reconsider it
so let's let's try to to model this this phone in this sheet uh what kind of energy source uh i i we didn't speak about that
mm-hmm
it's a it's a normal battery or
yeah it migh it it'll need uh more than a conventional one it won't be uh just maybe you might use a a. a. battery actually
what do you say mael
for this one it's a normal battery
yes
just so one battery
'kay
electronics
given speech recognition i think w you should go for the less fancy chip
yeah
uh sample speaker yeah
yeah yes or sample sensor yes
sample yeah this one
yes this one
okay
case
um
so
curved
double curved yeah right
i see i
it's uh
double curve
mm
yeah it's gonna be more than just the biggest case definitely
so which one are we talking to
mm
are you talking about this or that
well
either of them
oh yes we are talking about but they have the same shape but actually bu
mm-hmm
mm
yeah
they're both going to be not basic cases
so th th this would be double curves
mm-hmm
yeah
'kay
uh plastic would be the material
yeah
the basic one yep
is it zero franc
a special colour
uh special colour now we leave it to the covers
uh
so now we're either going button or l. c. d. s l. c. d. display
push
mm yes but
l. c. d. is
it's okay
just say l. c. d.
is that price per unit or for the whole
yeah th now this is per per unit this number of components
ah good
thing
so it would need twelve buttons
yeah we might need a scroll wheel right for that
no but for this one it's twelve euro
no for that one also
there are twelve
so one two three four five six seven eight nine t
yeah that's a scroll
yes
twelve i believe
so this comes to eighteen
mm
and that's without any special button supplements
yeah one scroll wheel you might need
so
so we'd have a special colour special form and special material on all of them
they're not just standard buttons
uh
so i think but th do you agree th that thi
wait a minute it's not it's not double curved it's single curved right
because it's there is no like
yes i
but i thought it would be curved on two it's like it's curved on the sides and curved on the top and bottom as well that's what i thought
yes i'm i'm no i'm no i'm not sh
sure
well it's you know this curve like this so it's w there is only
yes i kno undes i understand what you mean yes
is is is there is nothing like y you know in the other stuff there are yeah concave
you talking about concave curves
uh-huh
so i think we can put um
both
you think a single curved
the single curved in the sixteen
that makes uh seventeen
and what are just the bt buttons we have twelve buttons are you sure
yeah
mm
yes
uh
we have more we've got those the scroll wheel on the side and yeah
so i had a bad uh
bad estimate right
w d we have we haven't talk about a but that's no a is very exp inexpensive i believe but it is not in the list
the sc
bad estimation
mm
we've got a scroll wheel for the volume don't we or is it some other thing that's not on there
w ho h is this a scroll wheel or is this a a a sort of button which can be pressed on two sides uh so for higher and lower
no no no
'kay we've only got five minutes left guys so we need to wrap it up pretty fast
yes a kind of scroll wheel
so this is even more than the um
mm
than the cost you gave the sixteen euros
mm-hmm
okay so based on that yeah um where is the es okay sample speaker
that is the sample sensor and sample speaker
so um
but still yeah it
we just need that actually
we're
we need one
we
we could go for the for the for the for the for a simple chip but then we can't have the the speech recognition yes
yes
no we cannot yeah
so so w when we w a this would this would be cutting the speech recognition
so
s
but the um
yeah but if you have the near the l. c. d. you can um choose select between um you know like uni universal between audio
t. v. and v. c. r. and this needs a needs a advanced chip
transti
right matthew
oh i i it
or regular chip
i think it's going to be y y yeah it's th with the regular chip yeah
i think yeah regular today we you can do that with regular chip
say say it's regular regular chip and we still on fifteen so
yeah
okay
okay
yeah
so
and what about the number of buttons buttons uh
yes but that maybe
my matthew
well we can just say
uh
one
when you look at this w this u uh item
yeah
ca l we are just when we just want to uh to cut the number of buttons we have to make seven to to fit in in twelve twelve fifty
but
so is it possible
but that's seven basic buttons right seven buttons without any adds on without special colours or form or material
that'll be then we have uh have to ask the user to press it several times
mm-hmm
you cannot make a phone to your boss saying twelve fifty is really
no no he he he i i
really low no
well
so the l. c. d. display is is three francs sorry three euros by itself
mm-hmm
and uh we don't want to to change that right
we we really want a l. c. d. other otherwise we w wouldn not get the market
uh
mm-hmm
otherwise y you ha you have a s ve very normal uh thing like this
it's evident
yeah
mm
so twelve euro fifty we got two off of the battery we can't do anything about that
and i dunno
so ten fifty if we want an l. c. d. dispra display that's seven fifty
um so we've got seven fifty to use for the case and for the buttons
mm
and the chip
sorry the chip's up there already
mm-hmm mm-hmm
so we're gonna have to scale this down to get within budget there's no doubt about that
a
so wha what what each of us think about the because it's measure point the l. c. d. um
do you think it's important
or we could even replace them by buttons actually
because sometimes whe when you watch the t. v. in fact you have a big display and maybe you don't need one more in your hands
i dunno i'm just asking
a actually it depends it depends what kind of functionalities you want to add into it
mm
mm
yep
for example if you add two more functionalities then better you add two more buttons
or and you'll have l. c. d. display which is that is going to bring the cost by two two euros at least
mm
yeah
i think unless we can really drive these prices down we need to get rid of the l. c. d. display
okay so we can get rid of it and then add a couple of buttons
yeah it's true yeah
but uh do we want that
on the market point of view yeah
what do you think uh l. c. d. is a major feature or
mm
i
for the price it's gonna be what we can afford
and it's looking like we can't afford the l. c. d. display there's no way we can get it in there
i think we have to come to a decision now just i i think we we what we just do i is vote
mm
about the uh the l. c. d. uh display so
mm-hmm
you assume you want a democratic voyt vote right
yes
okay
yes
yes
okay
one man one vote
s so who thinks the the l. c. d. disply display should be i should be in it
i th i'd like t it to be in but i can't see it happening
i can't see it fitting in
mm
mm-hmm mm-hmm
i think but
we need to be
bu y you're a power voter uh veto anyway as project manager
mm-hmm i know but
yeah
yeah but the only thing is that what is the multiple functionalities you want to include with that
well we have to make a decision now that's it
yeah
yes
so uh uh having an l. c. d. s display is just uh uh have very very limited amount of buttons
is that acceptable
ca can i have can the functions be implement in an
yes
you've you you agree
w i i i just
so hav hav having seven buttons instead of twelve
yeah
so that wou would be cutting cutting suh say about these buttons
because one yeah th show me that uh actually we could in fact we move these three buttons and have three uh possibilities for each of the three here
mm
here one at the middle and at the
mm
bottom
i think then we we're really losing ease of use
okay
that will create another problem
for the people to use it
it's not going to be easy
okay
okay
mm
doing that
so um i i think we should we should cut the l. c. d. screen
that that's that's my opinion
no it's okay you uh cut the l. c. d. screen and introduce two more buttons
just
okay
so l. c. d. 's out is speech rec out now
we've
the speech recognition is out
yep
uh where l. c.
because of the budget yeah
yep
okay w we now we can just uh
so are we basically back to the original one now back to the first version
which turns out to be on budget exactly pretty much
yeah
with these new costings
yes
so just look at forget that one and look at that one now
yes
yeah
yes
i th i th i think w we just go for this one and that that now twelve euros is the
mm
yep
is is the price okay
okay
my m my supervisor will be glad that it's fifty cents cheaper than he expected
well that's that's
yep
actually yeah we we we will not need the really uh expert designers um because the amount yeah
so
mm
yeah
yep
okay
so w we can go back and l talk to the suppliers maybe and see if we can drive the prices down to add a few more things in but that's all we can do with the restrictions we have at the moment
okay good
then we the same
thank you
okay
that was it
mm-hmm
that's it
thanks
cool
okay
how do you wear this thing
hmm
mm mm mm
not too many cables and stuff
original
is recorded
okay
okay so welcome everyone
so we are here for the kickoff meeting of uh the process of designing a new remote control
so i will first start with a warm welcome opening stuff
then uh we will uh see what will be uh our product and what will be the different step we will have to design it
and uh then we will uh discuss if we have few ideas and we will uh end uh by uh dispatching the different task you will be you will have to fulfil to complete this process
so
uh
just one thing
uh you said twenty five minutes but i have something else to do uh
so gotta have another meeting uh soon so maybe you could hurry up a bit
sorry
it's true
i have another meeting so if you could uh
you have another meeting soon
yeah
so you have to be quick
yeah for the lawnmower project
okay
okay
so the the goal is to have a remote control so to have an advantage over our competitors we have to be original
we have to be trendy and we have to also try to be user friendly
so uh the design step will be divided in three uh main points
first it will be the functional design
third is the conceptual design and then is the desired design
so the functional design is to identify the main user needs the technical function the remote control should fulfil
and then we will move to f conceptual design where we'll specify the different component involved
what kind of user interf interface we want and what are the different uh trend in user interface and stuff like that
and then the desired devi design will consist in uh specifically implementing and detailing the choice we've uh made in the second point
so i will now ask you which is very important for the design of a new remote control for to uh each of us to to draw uh your favourite animal on the white board
what an original idea
do you have any idea of which animal you want to show us
orangutan
okay that's good
no no n
n n
can i give you the no
you should
but i don't have to say anything
when i'm drawing the orangutan
if you want to react uh about this wonderful drawing uh i'll let you uh comment
it's an abstract drawing of an orangutan
okay it's an abstract drawing
yes
i think it's nice and original
you should write y the name i think
i don't have a red colour
usually orangutans have red hair so this is a very important but i don't have red pen so
okay
yes
you want to draw something christine
okay uh sorry
you have to imagine a little bit um
this
of course your animal is recorded so it's not lost
sorry too uh
yes
i know
is this uh
wha what is this strange beast
is it beautiful
is it a monster
do you know
it's a cat
it's a cat
isn't it
i thought these things did not exist
yes yes is it like that
me ah yeah
is it better
ah yeah
ah okay it's pretty
yeah
okay
it's my cat
okay it's your cat
does have a name
yeah
the name is caramel
caramel
caramel
ah ha
yeah
okay
olivier do you want to
and you i think i'm too short for the cables
okay i go but next time you'll do something i'm sure
next time i concentrate
i'm a bit short on cable
okay
so what could i draw
maybe i can draw like
a very simplified cow
i don't know if it looks like a cow
he looks like a bong
like a what
okay
sorry
no
quite squarey
scary
i dunno it it looks more like a donkey in fact i would say
he also
i i think we will be finished this uh
mm
okay so i hope that it helps you uh in the process of designing a remote control
is it for uh for putting a for logos no
okay
that's
let's move on
so
here the uh financial objective of our project
that is to say to to have a production cost lower than twelve point five euros and have a selling price of twice that price t in order to target a profe profit of uh fifty uh million euros
i is there a matter for a new remote control
yeah if it's trendy original i d fulfil the user needs
is it uh a single device remote control or is it a multi device remote control
we have to discuss that point
ah this is not defined at all
on yeah you you can suggest points like this
ah okay
so what what so we have to decide for example if it can control one device or multiple
so what's what are your ideas about that
maybe i can have the your opinion from the marketing side
well uh do we sell other stuff
uh if if we bundle the remote control with something uh to sell then it could be a single device
otherwise it could be programmable one otherwise who would buy a remote control from us
okay so if it selled uh by its own i it it would rather be for multiple device
yeah
do you agree
mm-hmm
yeah
so maybe it should be for multiple devices
and uh do you have any ideas um of uh design ideas or any uh uh technical requirement we we should uh fulfil
i think we shouldn't have too many b for my part
no i couldn i cannot fi think of any requirements right now
i think
if we don't have so many buttons could be nice
few buttons
okay
and do you have it also to be to be lighted in order to be used in the dark
might be a good idea
yeah
okay
and do you have any um any uh idea of the trend the trend in domain what it shouldn't it should look like or things like that
something which is not squarey maybe uh not a box
mm
with rou okay
like for okay
something like that least fits in your hand
yeah
yeah
okay
the basic requirement
so
fit in your hand yeah
only a buck
and also it have i it may be it may be important for the remote control to be uh
to to resist to various shocks that can happen if it fall
mm-hmm
waterproof
water proof as well
and i think we should have a device
maybe it is original because you can uh use it in your uh in your bath whereas the others can't
maybe water proof would be very original
sorry
havin having a water proof remote control so that the people can uh use it in their bath
mm
that could be uh
b it seems uh so
but uh if you don't have an waterproof remote control it means you can just cover it with some plastic and you can sort of f
yeah but it is still something uh you have to buy and that is um not maybe very
and
and that's one of the that's one of the shock i mean there are people that have a remote control and they are worried that it's going to break and they put some extra plastic around it
yeah mayb
that's people they actually do it themselves
b
but maybe we can bulk it with uh already this plastic thing and uh the waterproof uh stuff as well
yeah
directly
i it will look a bulky in that case
yeah
yeah
maybe we can sell uh all that together so so plastic protection
and uh and a waterproof box as well
that might be good uh track to follow
like as an optional thing
optional or selled with it
and i i think we should have something most of the time i i lose my remote control
we should have s uh special bu button on the t. v. to make the remote control beeping
yeah
maybe we can have uh
but we don't design the t. v.
ah yeah
maybe we can have uh something you whistle and uh the remote control uh beep
yeah
barks
barks
yeah barks yeah
so we can uh have a whistle uh remote control
yeah
yeah whistle
i don't know whistle able
whistle tracking
th
whistle tracking yeah
whistle tracking remote control
that's a good idea that's very original and that's can uh improve
that's that's quite cool but uh of course we you don't normally need uh any audio uh recording stuff on your remote control right
yeah d d uh
so i it's just going to add t to the cost
yeah but s still we have to mm we have to have an advantage over our competitors
i think this is a good advantage
it's cool
i think i like the idea but i'm not sure about the what you who is giving who's giving who's giving our budget
yeah
we have to ask
who's
yeah
we have to ask the quest of that's uh design to the uh industrial um designer
yeah
yeah
yeah
which is you
'kay
yeah
okay so try to find that for next meeting
okay
okay
so next meeting is in thirty minutes or so uh
don't panic
don't pani
so so i will ask the industrial designer to find out more about this industrial design so any working any working function we have discussed
mm-hmm
so then i will ask the user interf interface designer to to think about the point we discussed like the number of buttons
the the fact that is lighted or not things like that and what would be convenient for the user
mm-hmm
and also um i will ask the market expert to uh try to find out what are the absolute requirements
what is absolutely needed in a remote control uh for the user
so
and then uh i will uh just ask you to think about that and uh look at your mail because you will receive uh some good advice soon
mm
so
thank you i think that's all for this point
good
mm-hmm
thank you
uh so we come back in five minutes
half an hour
anyway you will receive some messages
be careful
you eat it
does it move uh
okay but i don't know if it uh is still correctly uh
we'll see
ah
okay
okay everyone's ready
hello
so we are here for uh for uh functional design
okay
so we are here for the functional design meeting mm so first i will show the agenda so
we will uh i will take notes during this meeting so
i will try to summarise it and put that summary in the shared folder if you want to look at it afterwards
so then uh each of you will uh lead a presentation on the task that has been required last time so user requirement specification
technical function design and working design
then i will uh present you some new project requirements i received from uh the management board
then we will take uh the decision on on the remote control uh needed functions
and then i will assign you the task for the next part of the meeting
of the of the process
so uh who want to start the the presentation of what they did
mm
f do you want to start
make a start yeah
you can start
so
cable camera
you have uh powerpoint
should be in my in their folder no
ah yeah maybe there
up
okay
who are you
um at three i think
no
mm
ouch
and
okay
we have a technical problem uh
do we think w s in the in the wrong folder maybe
it is possible
you put it on
no
it was somewhere in something like this
i don't remember the name actually must be something like messenger ami or something
what do you have in short cut
go up
participant two
yeah go up
yeah
again
no
go back
you have no
uh maybe messenger ami
messenger
over
okay
no
there is nothing
there's no
we have a technical problem
let's go and check
yeah
i'll go and check
otherwise could you just describe
by hand
okay
with the the whiteboard
yeah
if you remember yeah but that's
yeah
so uh
basically what we want here is a remote control right
yeah
so um the question well first of all what to control
so most people want to have a a remote for their hi fi and t. v. and stuff like that
mm-hmm
and but other people want th also remotes for controlling uh and toys like robotic pets and little robots and stuff and other people also want to have remotes for controlling um whole house
mm-hmm
mm-hmm
yeah
yeah so there's a project i think called x. house or something like that that does that uh you can integrate your remote with uh computers stuff
mm-hmm
so there is one that is one thing
the other is the
the finder feature yeah by whistling or whatever
uh if you have the finder feature then you can also have
okay
uh at the same time as and general voice commands if you want yeah
mm-hmm
so i think it should be a package in that case
uh so the user interface will consist of two parts
one is the voice command part and on one is the actual buttons part
uh and th the buttons part would be uh a set of buttons for choosing devices a set of buttons for special navigation in space
mm-hmm
mm-hmm
a set of buttons for linear access of medium and a set of buttons for random access
okay
yeah
what do you mean by linear access then
like a video tape goes forward backwards uh fast and stuff yeah
ah
um
okay so special navigation linear access random access and there's a fourth one no
mm
so the better now for special navigation
yeah
for special navigation for example you might have a t. v. in the menu and you going to change yeah
okay
then linear access then random access
uh
mm
yeah and also parameter changing
ah yeah parameter okay
so if there are common parameters maybe we should put special buttons for that um or maybe we could have everything uh generic but uh there are a lot of uh remotes on the market right now and basically this is most of the almost everybody has this stuff
okay
okay
okay and and voice command did you uh
voice command w we could specify anything
we could assign any button a command to any button if we have enough processing power i guess so
okay
okay
yeah
okay
yeah
so that's uh that close your investigations
yeah
uh yeah i think so
okay
not so far
okay
maybe we can have a look at the user requirements with
yeah
um i dunno if you can open the uh m is not here
i dunno if i can open it
maybe you can s
it's
uh in
yeah okay
messenger no
no
in document
mm computer yeah
in which folder
where did you put it
here
here
short cut to ami shared folder
mm
but it's not
um
maybe you can send it to me by email
just to participant one
at ami
mm-hmm
yeah i can do that
i will try to show it to everyone that would be more comfortable
okay
um
you send it
it's participant one
yeah
uh this is this email
i'm designing the user interface
okay
you can uh
okay
so maybe i can switch slides when you whenever you ask that will be more convenient
yeah
so okay functional requirements
okay so you can you can go
okay so in our usability lab we observed the remote control use among one hundred subjects and the subjects also filled a questionnaire okay
mm
yeah
and here i have the results so you can see that um seventy five per cent of users find most remote controls ugly so we have to find something to make them more
more nice more kind
eighty per cents of users would spend more money when the remote control would look fancy
eighty hundred per cent of users would spend more money when the remote control would look oh to it's not good
so okay
so it's not in theory but i i can i can say yeah
we can just keep doing that
yeah
fifty f uh seventy five per cent of users say they s zap a lot
so mm we have to have a remote control uh very um out for that
uh the buttons have are to be um uh uh like you say resist resisting to to shocks
okay
um and fifty per cents of users say they only use uh ten per cents of but of the buttons in the in the remote control
okay
so all the buttons we we have to put are have to to have um a use a real use and not only or
okay
okay so fewer buttons maybe would be good
yeah
f not many buttons and uh and uh uh u useable buttons
okay
but what kind of remote controls did you look at
sorry
what kind of task was it
it was a t. v.
yeah
uh most for most is t. v.
yeah
yeah but in fact we it it seems that we are going to make a t. v. remote control according to new requirements i received from the management bo i will present them in the following
huh
uh-huh
ah good
'kay you can go so
okay
so there are other frustrations expressed by users
so they said uh they lost uh often the remote control in in the room so they want to have a way to to
yeah
to find it
to find it
yeah
um and um lot of the time they it takes too much time to learn how to use a new remote control
yeah
so they want something s really very simple and uh easy to use
mm-hmm
okay
and uh remote controls are bad for
what is her other side
r. s. i. um
i dunno
other side yeah yo wa your wrist
it i can become painful you can have tendonditis
oh yeah
yeah
i did not knew that
if you also up on a computer in a strange position
okay so you we have to make it uh more ergonomic yeah
ergonomic
but uh
have to say ha ha
yeah
it's your job oh
uh
uh sorry got a message from microsoft
okay um before that i i have some some some thing uh to say before um
yeah
yeah yeah
we know that uh the user use uh a lot their um remote control um to to change channel
yeah
um and um to to change uh volume selection of the and uh and not uh a lot for setting for setting the the channels and uh thing things like that
okay
yeah
mm-hmm
mm-hmm
okay
so it's better to put uh uh uh something very easy to set and uh and
yeah
this function should be very uh accessible
very accessible yes
yeah okay
that's right
this is the main function okay
so then we asked some questions to them and um we asked this question if they prefer an l. c. d. screen or on their remultific function remotes control and if they mm pay more for speech recognition in remote control and you can go we have here the results of
yeah
yeah
yeah
the first question
of the questions
so you know that um
for the younger it's very important
to have l. c. d. and voice
to have the s yes and speech recognition
and uh and the others is not so important but uh we know that uh uh people between fifteen and twenty five are people who watch a lot t. v. and uh who who wh can use a lot this uh
okay
so maybe we we can have a speech recognition in
yeah maybe this this is important
yeah
moreover th maybe those uh like those teenager customer could advice their parents to buy this equipment and so we can we have to take care of that point of view i think or so
mm
mm
yeah
okay and if there is th the conclusion now
so as we say before i think uh um a remote control lightening in the dark it's it's a good thing
okay
uh not to many mud buttons like we we said before
e easy to use uh a way to find it easily in the room and uh uh resistant to to shock and to to
yeah
mm-hmm
okay
an i s no yeah
okay these are the user requi
i dunno if you see something else important or
i'm just thinking of some thing
mm
yeah
um
we want to have a no i don't know if this is a good idea
we want to have a a general remote control for everything
no no no
we w it seems that we no want to have a t. v. remote control
okay
from the management board i receive an email
mm
yeah
cos it would be costly
uh and and also it it would take more time to develop to have a a general generic remote control
yeah
yeah yeah
yeah
mm i it's not true i think
the the second claim that you put
no no
that it would be too long to develop
yeah
i think that should be the same
oh yeah
because i received that email from management board and they seems to tell that that if we want to be on the market as early as possible we should uh focus on t. v. more where it seems that the market is more important
so maybe it's a good decision
i dunno
what's your opinion
i have uh i've no idea i mean i should know a bit more about how fast we can uh design it
i don't think
uh yeah
finish tonight
yeah
okay
but basically yeah maybe i can continue with my presentation it would be al you you but i think we have some technical problem or so
yeah
okay
yeah
yeah
so i'm just going to describe briefly what we do in the remote control
maybe you can go to the whiteboard if you have some drawings to do i don't know
if fact
yeah but
mm
do i have oh yeah
now i have enough cables
like a you feel a bit like a dog with this stuff
okay so i'm just going to describe in fact for for a remote control this is quite easy
we just have sorry i'm going
okay
are you okay
like that
i'm just going to describe
basically we have a a battery a power supply here
after that we just have um user interface
let's say that
um
something like that which could be um a l. c. d. let's say or um an array of push button something like that
push button or a l. c. d.
after that we we feed that into um
uh an electronic chip
so i say u. c. and i feed that to uh l. e. d. which is uh infrared um which is a an infrared um component
and so what we for for myself this for for us this is quite easy
u. c. is the central unit
yeah
okay yeah
y it's a it's this just a chip which does all the um numerical
computation
numerical computation according to your display
okay
and so for us uh this is quite easy
we just need to take to define what we want to do when the user interface um wants something and after that we just do the coding to s and send that to to to the not the to the television
okay
so for us this is quite easy
okay so this is quite easy
yeah
um we just have to define the processing power that we need uh especially if we want to do some uh speech recognition
there is not that much constraints
in that case that mean that we are going to use more for simple
this will think this will take more time to develop also
yeah of course of course
yeah
and um but for a standard one this is really easy
it's a question of one month and so on s
soon
to have a you s you speak about with voi voice control
no no no no i say yeah standard uh standard remote control takes maybe uh one month to to do that
standard button one
yeah
so the only time problem is the sp voice recognition
yeah
yeah
definitely
yeah
so do you have any idea of how long it would take to have voice recognition now
ten years
i would say
i would say uh about eight months to have the first results
okay so i it's a bit long yeah
yeah
i can
um
one month for the standard one with button
yeah
even if we have a l. c. d. display
yeah even
i mean that this is really standard devices now
um eight
for uh speech recognition
okay yeah
okay so we can take this into account
so who think it would be good to go for uh like speech recognition
but we don't have time to market
yeah it will
and also how much uh i think
i think we should contact management
during the kickoff meeting you say that we we shouldn't we shouldn't go up to twelve point five euro per unit so how many units should we sell to have a
euros
yeah yeah
well
well each unit is is sell uh twenty five euros
uh
yeah but how many yeah
how muc how much do you get how much do you if you buy one million units h no one hundred thousand units
eh chips
we're gonna need chips right
yeah
yeah
how much will it cost for one hundred thousand
usually this is less tha at two dollars per chip
okay
because we are
so you have any idea for a powerful one that has uh good enough for do speech recognition
yeah we can
yeah
okay
so
no it doesn't
it seems that that we want to sell like four million units from the first meeting
mm-hmm
okay
four million
okay
maybe we can uh we can look at the new requirement i receive from the management board and discus discuss all function we want to have
mm
um
i just had a question uh do you want to continue with your presenta
yeah i i will continue
is it
well ask your question if you want
um you say that i don't remember by heart but thirty per cent
mm
of the tested people say that's it's quite difficult to to to use the remote control
yeah
do they say that this is difficult but for the same reason or do they have other reason
oh
to to maybe to keep in mind maybe to access to that menu you should do something like that
would j
uh yeah w i i think they they say that it's uh difficult to learn how to use it but i when you know how to use it
mm-hmm
mm-hmm
it's it's okay
okay
and
but
it's not intuitive first
yeah
but yeah maybe and what about if we design a remote control which can be configure as you want
you say that i want i have six button
mh hmm
a a lot of people are uh if you have the l. c. d. screen if you can do it completely the way you want because the buttons also look the way you want them but it will be hard to configure i mean imagine i uh so it's really something for the expert user
yeah
yeah
yeah
but but also it seems that
yeah
yeah
okay
so
i mean there are markets and markets
i think the young people are th uh are uh christine here said uh you have a uh it is yeah
yeah
yeah
so for our young people uh it will be cool they can be able to use it
th maybe their parents will not but they will configure it
i guess
i don't know if there is study about that
yeah
mm-hmm
maybe it would be more complex to configure it to be simple than creating a simple product
mm
yeah
yeah
yeah
mm
mm
and there are another thing is that if we make something that's simple and easy to use that's bas to use immediately that means that it will be exactly the same as everything else
yeah
yeah
all right
yeah
otherwise if it's different then of course everybody has somebody has to learn to use it first
yeah
yeah
but also we we see that that most people find it find remote controls too complex because they have too many buttons and they mainly use only channels and volume buttons
mm
mm-hmm
so we may just uh make a very easy to use remote control with mainly those buttons and maybe also um
yeah
some lightning stuff too
because most people find also hard to to find the remote control
losed lose it etcetera
mm-hmm
these these are these two points are the main frustrations so maybe if we design something very simple and easy to uh find when lost it will uh add uh a serious competitive advantage
without making something too complex and too long to develop
mm
mm-hmm
so but le let us see first the new requirement
so we don't have to so this this uh is uh is um in the this is in the same direction as we were speaking so we don't have to make a very complex remote controls to access teletext and stuff like that
but teletext is just one button
yeah but then you have to you have to define the buttons to surf amongst pages and stuff
you you just write the write the numbers
yeah
so well
so will you add with the channel keys right
yeah
so
so anyway we don't have to include this feature because it's it's not used any more by users they prefer to s
i am
i'm sure that uh it don't like but uh i don't see just one button
yeah
so
i dunno
if i one button is still one more button
if if if we want to make it very simple we have to reduce number of buttons compared to th to our competitors
mm-hmm
well anyway i have this point
we can discuss
also um so as as i told before uh it would be better if it's only for the t. v. um
because we want to be quick on on the market
and then also we have to make very uh uh clear that this uh
this remote control is is part of of our products and show our corporate uh logo and and colours on the on the design as well so that uh they identify it as one of our product
so this is the the key point
so before uh finishing we can uh define uh what would be the characteristic of the o th of the control of the remote control and which button do we need which function do we want etcetera
capital
mm
so
do you um so so from from the the marketing expert i think
a key aspect is the easy to use aspect
it should be very simple and most button are never used only ten per cent of the button are are used often so i think we have to do something very simple and i think we all agree on that point
mm
mm-hmm
no
mm
well if it is going to be just a t. v. remote control it is going to be very simple
yeah okay
so yeah the key point here is simple
maybe
so few buttons channel
volume control
and what el what function do you see
well if it's going to be as simple as possible then just have the remote control there is no other function that i can see
in addition to that
really
yeah
maybe switch t. v. on and off
uh no you want to keep television on so that the advertising can revenue can come back to us
yeah
or something
yeah
volume maybe a mute button and then on off button
mm
and that's all
uh i know that som you say that many people are doing plenty of a lot of zapping
mm-hmm
mm
i know tha i discovered that when i did a quick look uh they do now som they do something which is quite nice now
you have a button you you press it and this is uh the previous channel which has come back
it's a memory yeah
okay
yeah this is cool
maybe we can include that also
previous previous channel button
so we have like channel button the previous channel button the volume button plus a mute button and uh just the the traditional on off button
mm-hmm
mm-hmm
mm-hmm
and uh and of course the channel changing buttons
yeah
i i talk about that yeah
how should they how should we implement that
because uh could be numerical only or could be also incremental
yeah
incremental definitely because zapping you you switch them
mm-hmm
let's say that we can do something like that
this is uh incremental but once you press it for a long time you go five by five
we go faster
to go fa to go faster
mm
mm
it's an interesting idea that if you press it for a long time it does something else in general
so if you you have your ten buttons for the for the numeric the numerical buttons and you have instead of having just one memory
yeah
you have if you press them for a long time
no
doesn't work does it
maybe we should have also a digit button
maybe we should have a complete keyboard and just type console commands
yeah
change channel to eight
maybe we have also to have digits or only incremental
no
i dunno bec because if you have the
well if it's useful like if if you want to change between three channels for example then you h you cannot you cannot cannot work with just memory being incremental
uh
yeah
because you have your previous channel button if you have incremental only it's not uh it isn't worth it because the previous channel is eith either minus one or plus one
yeah
yeah
yeah
so i think we need also digits
okay
maybe we we can make very obvious the channel and volume button button and smaller button down there with the the digits
yeah when you zap usually you will have to press the same button all the time and
yeah
or we can do something like that
we can design the remote control to have access
yeah
you know some remote control have uh protection and so you you y
mm-hmm
yeah
hey i just thought this thing there is a i mean you know there is are some with a wheel like this
you
instead of having the up down buttons for uh you can have the wheel
yeah
yeah a kind of joystick
yeah
yeah
maybe we can have a wheel for incremental
yeah
okay
so have a wheel for incremental have the digits uh on the lower side that can be closed so as you say protected
mm-hmm
mm-hmm
and uh yeah i think this is the basi
on the lower side i think it you have to turn it
no
and do we do we have a
if we do that
or a or a ball yeah not a a wheel but a ball and you say uh to
no a wheel is better
yeah
i would say the wheel is better
because of that
what is the expert of uh
yeah
because it's uh it's it's not like a volume which is smooth yeah
the channels change one by one
yeah
so you have to the user has to like to should feel the the the discrete sense a bit
yeah the yeah
okay
yeah
yeah
that's a good idea
well also we have to decide uh so it should be lightening in the dark i think because most people lost their remote control
's quite it's quite easy we do that w with back light on the on the wheel
okay
yeah
even if i l. e. d. uh or a if if it's the l. c. d. feature uh whatever yeah
a blue a blue l. e. d. and we sell that um
yeah and do we put an l. c. d. display
yeah
because it was important for young customers if you remember
i think it's only put on if cou have multi function
yeah
if you do not multi function then there is no p point in having l. c. d.
just increase the cost
okay
the user does not have an advantage really
so no l. c. d.
mm-hmm
hmm
and so no speech as well because it w it would delay too much the development process
okay
well if it's going to delay yeah but uh it will be cool
it would
because a user could say c. n. n. for example and it would go c. n. n.
mm-hmm
mm
yeah
that would be cool
but eight months is really long and
yeah
maybe we can just uh
ten years
okay
so um i i will uh i will so i we will move to next meeting so in after the lunch break uh here are the individual uh action uh you are required to do but you will be uh recalled to the actions by uh email i think but you can take notes if you if you want but well the instruction will be sent
mm-hmm
so
thank you for uh your suggestion and i i will make a summary of that meeting that i will put in the shared folder you can't see and uh and then you will um you will be able to to see what has been uh has been said on on this meeting and and what has been decided
okay
okay
okay
uh maybe for next meeting uh send me your presentation before by email so that we can see them uh altogether
yeah
that would be easier
mm
what is the folder that you put yours in
and did it it did work
no
no it did not work
no no
she send it to me by email
ah yeah
i dunno i dunno it
mm
okay
so maybe this is better to send it by email
okay what is your email
okay
so yeah i i'm it's in the first uh email so i'm participant one at ami uh where is that it's here
at participant one
okay
participant one at ami
okay
so see you after lunch break
'kay thank you
well during lunch break actually
so next time we should have a fight
how about uh management or something
who happens to be your friend
okay
mm-hmm
so we are here for the concept design meeting
so we will first start by summarizing the mm the previous meeting and the decision we've taken
uh i will take notes during this meeting so uh that you can uh look at my uh folder to see the summary of this meeting afterwards
so each of you will uh show us the various investigation they've done during uh previous uh hours
we'll then t take decision in concert and then uh uh we will uh define the nest next task to have to be done before the next meeting
so last time we decided to have a simple interface
we also decided to have a wheel to change channel previous channel button
channel digit uh buttons should be uh protected by plastic cover or something for the remote control to look very simple
we have also button for volume and to switch on off the t. v.
we have also uh the lightening feature for the remote control to be easy to find
and for fast development and low cost we have decided to have no l. c. d. no voice features
so now uh we will have three presentations
so the conceptual specification by industrial designer the specification of the u. i. by or u. i. okay
abdul al hasred is my name
and uh the last point is uh trend watching by market expert
so maybe we can start with uh industrial design
so this is the presentation
uh i. d. you want
maybe i can switch slide uh on your request
yeah
i only v have three slides so
i just look at the mm
um just this
on some web pages to find some documentation and i think a remote control is as i s mentioned previously
yeah
you just have a a very simple chip and the mm the user interface is just done usually by push button
and in our case we are using a um a wheel control
so uh uh i was looking basically for that chip
which is uh very very standard and uh i just looked for the wheel sensor and the standard push button
and um yeah we can change directly
yeah
in fact i have the number of that element which is very standard for remote control
the push button are usually extremely cheap but i just have one problem and this is related with the wheel sensor which seems to be quite expensive
okay
mm-hmm
and i think we if we could just talk about that if we really need a wheel sensor or if we can not if if we could combine something with the push button
okay
uh a wheel sensor is fifty time the price of a a a push button
yeah
but is it a significant price on the whole remote control
mm
because we can afford up to twelve euros for the price of the remote control
yeah
yeah i i th
so will will will this with uh including all possible things so buttons wheel and the chip be uh lower than twelve euros to produce
but i don't think that uh we should
we should talk about uh the design of the box also which needs some money
yeah
okay
also have to say did you receive the email about the voice recognition
but
um that's all yeah
no
you received something
i haven't chec
yeah
you we uh an email from the manufacturing division that they have basically a voice recognition chip already developed
hmm
says
yeah
it says that ri right now they just use it to uh to record uh answers to particular questions
but i guess it could be
and could it be adapted
i guess it's possible
i mean instead of recording the answers you can just uh record uh something simpler like a command
okay and there can uh recognize some commands and stuff
yeah you reco recognize commands and you can record new commands and stuff so if they already have it as uh as a chip
okay
yeah
then we we could use it
okay maybe we can just uh listen to this presentation and then take decision later on according to those news
okay
mm-hmm
yeah but i think it's yeah sorry i haven't written my personal references
um the i i just want to mention the the problem of the the r
wheels sensor which is much more expensive than any push button and if we could reduce that
okay
we we have already some good things uh with um um with the backlight of the push button
mm-hmm
i have a question about that actually
um what is the purpose of the light
just to to make something which is uh slightly more design that uh a squarey box with a rubber
is
you can easily find the button in the dark or so
but
but in th in the dark uh
yeah but is going to be always turned on the light
it will be turned on when the when the user move the remote control i think no
but if you move it then you have it you don't need to find it
hmm
you can see the buttons better of course
yeah
yeah
yeah
yeah
true
yeah
actually
but if you move it then you have to have some sensor to when you move it to detect your movement
as soon as you thought to move the the remote control you have the light
yeah but you need another sensor for that right
yeah
again
yeah no it's too expensive
i don't think that this is really expensive but at the end this is plenty of unexpen eh very cheap devices but uh the bill starts to be
okay
mm
extra
yeah okay
mm
yeah but i expected also the wheel would be cheap but you tell me that it is very expensive so yeah
first of all i was thinking to have a a continuous light and you w when t you you you you press the on button you have the light on your remote control
mm
when you want to turn off your device
mm-hmm
but it can be uh battery consuming no
to have the light always on
yeah a little bit
a little bit
mm
well we will discuss that after maybe
yeah
okay
the other presentations
so uh my one it uh should be in the shared folder
yeah
so
it was last time i saw it
and it is
okay
so just move to the next slide
okay
so basically want very simple right
that's the major idea as simple as possible
yeah
yeah
so i just look at some current designs uh on the web of usually more complicated remote controls
and let's look at two of them because uh th even though they have many buttons they look quite simple
and in our case we just uh reject the buttons what we don't need and it become even simpler
yeah
um
so
and also does it uh fit well in hand
because it was uh th your wrist problem with the usage
yeah
well this these uh these remotes are quite big so go to the next page so
we have all these buttons as you can see but most of them we just need the ones in the middle
yeah
yeah
yeah
so from the bottom or whatever is there uh the uh the numbers and then the top
yeah
uh until the ten also this middle part and on the left one is exactly the same
yeah
so it's basically more or less how we would like it with a big volume control big channel control and mute and power yeah
yeah
these are the basic thing
so it's only the central part
so basically w software we will build will look more or less the same as these two
yeah
with a maybe a more ergonomic design on on the bottom part
yeah if you have
for example i think that the volume and the buttons that are there on the top are not very easy to reach with your thumb
it could be on the right side for example
yeah
okay
yeah
because we don't have these input buttons and this other stuff that they have
and i think that the plastic cover is not very good uh idea because
okay
you open it it can break you ca you can do various things
uh you just need to put the channel numbers somewhere a bit out of the way
okay
s
okay
so that they're separate a bit yeah
will be down or okay
uh and it's easy to press the other the big buttons but uh it's not that difficult to press the the channel buttons either
mm
yeah i think that if you put the cover it will be even more difficult for the user
okay
alright you won't yeah
usually what i have noticed that people put the plastic cover on things that you normally don't mess with
like buttons for t uh tuning the channels and stuff like that
okay
yeah
that you want to protect a bit
and i think it's uh it's reasonable
okay
so i don't think
yeah this is just the the wheel
we could use the some wheels can be pushed down could use the push down of the wheel for the record if we want
mm
mm-hmm
uh so we could just basically use one just wheel and uh user could use just the wheel to do everything with the channels in that case
yeah
maybe the wheel will be a good advantage over our competitors
mm-hmm
because otherwise it's pretty standard apart the fact that it's very simple
so maybe it's worse to uh to have more expense on that's that aspect
to s
mm-hmm
yeah i guess the market researcher will tell us all about that
okay
so we can move to the is there any question
for
designer of user interface
or we can move to the next part maybe and discuss afterwards
okay
okay i can go
can i
yeah
so now the recent investigation we we have done fo of the remote control um
so the most important aspect for remote controls is to be fancy look and feel and not current functional look and feel
and um the second aspect is uh that the remote control should be uh technological innovative
and the third most important aspect is to to is that the co remote control should be easy to use
okay
so are things we are we have uh speak about before
mm-hmm
yeah
yeah
and um so you you can go
yeah
after
and there is a fashion watchers in paris and milan that have detected the following trends
uh fruits and vegetables will be the most important theme for clothes shoes and furnitures
so maybe if our remote control have to be a fruit form or vegetable form something like that or
okay
i support an apple
and the mm the material is expected to be spongy
uh i don't know which material can be spongy and if you
yeah
this is good also for
well wou wou i think we can certainly just put the electronics in a spongy thing it it would work right
yeah
yeah
mm-hmm
yeah
yeah
i think it is good also f to have a spongy material yeah
you can throw it to the television
yeah because it's robust
okay it's robust yeah
yeah
me too
hey that's a cool one
we could say that if you throw it you have a sensor and you throw it and hits the television and turns it off
when it d uh takes a shock
not good
yeah uh sorry
ah it's okay
i know that they do that for alarm clock also
an and and uh this uh you can yeah you can say that
yeah
you ca uh you can go uh before before yes
no
yeah
before
and you know here the more iz important aspect is the fancy look and feel after is uh technological innovative and after the easy to use
yeah
yeah
yeah
i think it's innovative to use the mm the wheel because i think no one else has
yeah
yeah that's why yeah that's why i think we have to keep that if it's possible
has it
yeah
i think it's it makes it both easy and both innos innovative
mm-hmm
innovative
so i think it's a good aspect and it should be kept
mm
how do we make it look cool is the question
cool fancy
yeah
we have to make it l look like a fruit or vegetable
yeah
maybe uh um a colour that remember some fruit uh things like that
what about um
mm
oh colour yeah
well the obvious thing is a banana i guess
oh i i
maybe yeah
i thought about a a pear for example
you know the pear is like that and it's it's easy to to have in in hand and uh
yeah and it's ergonomic as well
yeah
a pear
the banana is also ergonomic
yeah
maybe pear yeah or something like that
or a fruit like that
i dunno
yeah
we can discuss that uh
d d is is there anything you want to add
is there any fruit that is spongy
i don't think so
i think we we can have like yeah a pear is good fit well or banana as you told
yeah
and for maybe look and feel what about a a piece of ice
something like that
with blue l. e. d. inside
but that's not in the trend
you can make it um
yeah
the trend is spongy and vegetable fruits
yeah
it's not hard the metal
yeah
i think p spongy is good because it it will be robust as well
plastic
yep
so i think we can keep the wheel
because it's uh easy it's innovative even if the cost is a bit higher and we also have to find a
yeah
so a fruit like pear or banana wit uh any others idea you have
what kind of fr fruit would you like to to control your t. v. with
mm
odi
banana i think it's a nice idea
banana is also yellow so you you can't lost your remote control then
because
but
yeah
yeah
you y you don't use the banana when the banana is curving like that but when the banana is curving like that
two of the button yeah
yeah
with the wheel on the top and to control and here you have a a push button to
yeah
but you don't have
i think it's a good idea yeah
yeah so you can just have uh just have this curve yeah
and you move uh your hand here to press the buttons and then you move uh on the other side
yeah
so you can have it on on two sides and it'll be cool no
yeah
yeah
i think it's a good design and it's innovative as well then
maybe we can keep the banana
and it will be very easy to find
you can put also vibrator inside
and everybody knows what is a banana
yeah
basically
if you if you start with uh fancy fruits and fra s and tha
ah ha
you can also take into account the fact that the banana fits with the colour scheme of our company
oh yeah
yeah
yeah
yeah it's really uh really a good point
i hope the students of management die but anyway
now who are recording this meeting
i think it so
one second
so we have to take some decision on this aspect
so uh so for
sorry for uh component so
so
we have to think about those aspects sorry
so we will just use a a standard battery
yeah
and uh the chip we chip imprint we know exactly which one we are going to use
uh what do you mean by case
i think it's the box that should be spongy banana's shape
yeah
uh i mean for me if we use a a spongy banana case doesn't matter
i just want to have so something to prin to to fix my my components onto that box and that's it
the only th
yeah
y yeah that can be in inside th in the structure
yeah yeah
yeah
but uh the thing is that the buttons and the wheel have to be i mean if it's spongy then the buttons and the wheel have to i mean if it's spongy then it's going to move
spongy also
right
so it's going to be bend a lot
so if we try to push the buttons it you think it's possible
oh no i think it's possible
but
no the button would be in fact it it should be something odd shaped with a spongy cover
yeah
okay
yeah
this is uh like the
yeah
okay odd shape with spongy
cover
and standard battery okay a chip imprint there's no specific problem
so we agree to put the wheel
mm-hmm
wheel on the top
button where do we want some buttons
well usually hold 'kay we want it to be good also for the left hand users right
yeah
uh
so it have to it has to be symmetrical
yeah but okay
sa let's say that th o it has to be basically you can only take two sides
one on ths this side where is the thumb and the other side where there is uh yeah also the thumb
yep
yep
basically
or you could use use this one but i don't know if it's very comfortable to use this one for the wheel
yeah maybe the thumb is more comfortable
this for the wheel and then this for the buttons
yeah i think it's okay for both right and left
should have the two sides
mm-hmm
mm
so if the left we have
the op
i think you can turn it this way also
you can do both with both hands
wheel wheel buttons
yeah the problem is if you have buttons and wheel then when you turn it around the buttons are on the other side
i think it's okay
so you cannot see them
well you you will get used to it
yeah
and moreover th the button ar are lighted so you you immediately identify the right side because you have light on buttons
so the buttons have to be here and the wheel has to be
y
yeah i know but uh if you hold with your left hand and the wheel is here
and the buttons are here then when you turn it around the buttons will be on the other side
yeah
no you you i think you will use it only on the right or left hand whether you are righty or lefty
i think for lefty it's okay
i can do this movement and for righty as well
i think this doesn't change that much
okay
yeah
okay
maybe
yeah
so for interface we said also that we have uh this banana shape with button on the s on the side
and
and uh a wheel on the top
mm-hmm
yeah
so the colour is yellow
i think it's uh we defined everything according to
what we should what the decision we should take yeah
so maybe we can um
we can uh work on those aspects uh until next meeting
so have the final uh look and feel design according to the decision
and have the the user interface design and uh then evaluate the prodyuc the product
that is to say uh check if it fit the the requirement uh given by the users but according to uh your presentation it seems to be okay
it seems to be fancy innovative and easy to use
mm-hmm
so
so
to prepare the prototype i would suggest that the industrial designer and the user interface designer uh work together
that would uh
yeah
be better i think
and uh
and so uh
you will receive further instruction by emails as usual
mm-hmm
so do you need to add anything
yes master
no
you feel okay
yeah
you feel uh free to express what you want to say
yeah
you don't feel too constrained
you don't feel free to answer this
no
maybe you can make uh uh mm okay
okay so
thank you
see you
okay
je croix que c'est dommage de le it will be sad to destroy this prototype
it really looks like a banana
it is a banana
it is a banana
it is the essence of bananas
i would be confused with this thing
mm
s
mm-hmm
okay
how is everyone
hi
hi
so we are here for the detailed design meeting
mm-hmm
so we will uh i will first present what we are going to do in this meeting
then
uh i've i will also take notes during this meeting and i will send you uh a summary then as usual
we will then look at the evaluation criteria of the prototype presented by uh our two colleagues that make good work
and uh then we will see the financial aspects and the cost of the product
then we will uh evaluate the product
and uh end
with the conclusion of this project and see whether it fits
with it fulf if it fulfil the requirement or not
mm-hmm
so d let's start with the cost aspect so so i look at the aspect discussed last time that is to say uh to have a standard battery
to have a yellow banana shaped uh case with uh a rubber material around it to be uh to feel spongy
like a banana
and uh also at the different aspect like having a wheel etcetera
mm-hmm
and the cost ended to be ten point seven euros
so which is uh good because we had a price gap of twelve point five euros
mm-hmm
so for the financial aspect it's okay we can uh we can continue with this product uh as if
and we are now going to see the project evaluation with uh our marketing expert
yeah
okay
so uh you can have my project in
yeah
you have a presentation
uh yeah just a
four
participant four yes
evaluation
okay
okay
okay
so you can go
we can go through
okay
so i made an evaluation and the the evaluation criteria is made according to the users' requirements and the market trends we talked about uh during the previous uh meetings
so you can go through and okay so uh we have uh six points
okay
we
we talked about before
okay
so we we want to have a product fancy look and feel technologically innovative easy to use fashion easy to find in a room
and robust uh and uh uh i have a scale of uh seven points
yeah
mm-hmm
yeah
okay
so i go through all the uh all the points here
yeah
and uh according to what you think about the this project you can uh mm make a one point two point or seven point
okay
okay
and after we ha we have an an average and uh we see
mm-hmm
okay
the okay
uh so uh fancy look and feel what do you think
okay
maybe you can presen okay
f between o one and seven
maybe hold it
so i think it's uh very uh very nice
i give it a i give it a five
what do you think
yeah
so it's between one and seven
yeah
seven is the highest uh
seven is the
i will give a six
i will give a a five
mm-hmm
sorry
and you
eh
do you vote uh christine
do you also vote
no i just want to see something
maybe we all have to agree on a common
well we can very easily
yeah
mm-hmm
uh i think uh and need to as well
no problem
need to uh i don't know if you we ha we have to put uh one uh f
so this is your
if it's better or
one is most
i
uh uh
um
well we can choose what we want
yeah
okay let's say that seven is the best
or maybe we can say s seven is the best mm
okay
so so do note the grade we have five six for me five
five
and what what's your choice
oh sorry
six
how much would you give on the fancy aspect on the fashionable aspect
uh s you can how much what
how much would you you don't answer to this uh questionnaire
oh yes i mm i dunno mm i think six it's a good uh
so it will have five point five average
five point five average
yeah
wa can
okay
mm
okay
well does it
i sorry
okay
so after the technological aspect
okay techne technological aspect
so we we said uh we have uh a new technological uh thing with a wheel
yeah we have the wheel
uh
we also have the rubber material
which make it uh
like
new also
i think i would give a five
it's four
four
a four also because except for the wheel we don't have so much innovation
yeah
the rubber is
okay
d are we including the voice are you glu are we including the voice in the end or not
uh a four
i i
no
huh
no
okay
so what's your uh grade
no
four
four
so we have four four f and five
we can put four
yeah
for twenty five
yeah four
everyone is okay or four poin
four yeah let's put four
four
yeah
okay
doesn't it
very easy to use
do you think it's easy to use
yeah
yeah i think so
i give a seven i think
yeah
six
i would give a i would give a seven as well
it's very easy to use
mm six for me also
six
so six point five
six point five
'kay
six six six point five
okay
okay
is it fashion
oh yeah its its f its fruit fruit shape
seven
i would say seven
and is very very nice design
yeah it's fashion because it's a fruit and we say that the yeah seven
yeah we can we can put a seven here
yeah
yeah seven
yeah
yeah
seven okay
well we hope
easy to find
uh easy to find in a room
i lost my banana
i think you can't miss it
yeah
yeah
okay
uh
yeah i think it's cool
i think we can put a six here
we have the lightning or
yeah we have the we don't sesh especially have the lightning but
the lighting
so you'll make the material transparent so that it uh lights up completely or
so it's yellow
yeah
it's okay
i think it's very easy to i would say seven
seven
six
it's hard to miss it
yeah okay
yeah
is it is it robust
yeah it's rubber made of rubber i think it's m it's uh more rubber than uh other remote control
uh f yeah it's ru it's rubber
yeah
yeah the only problem there might be which know i if it's very sensitive they will i don't know
yeah
yeah
but it is uh it is surrounded by rubber material
yeah okay
yeah
so maybe we can put a six
yeah
mm
everybody is okay six
six or five
five
six is okay
six yeah for me
six
yeah
okay
yeah
yeah
s now um so
tadada
we have to sum up everything
twenty
thirteen uh twenty twenty six point five uh seven thirty two thirty six
thirty
thir
that's that's okay
six
six is a good
okay
good
uh if we say that seven it's uh it's the better and when uh s six sit six are good it's a good uh p product i think
yeah the top
yeah the be
okay so six is a
mm
so will become eight soon
so it's a good evaluation i think
it's very promising
yeah well it's a bit biased
we have a good price and uh
huh
yeah
okay
good
so this prototype is quite nice
because i saw uh some phones that were banana shaped uh wireless phones not mobile ones wireless for the house
yeah
okay
uh quite big also and they were selling something like a hundred euros two hundred euros
just a just a phone wireless
mm-hmm
so having this at twenty five euros is uh quite attractive i think
yeah
i think the
but almo also the complexity between a phone and a remote control is not cannot compare
yeah
yeah it's much more complex but
yeah
so i think we can summarise
so we have seen the prototype
it's very nice according to the work of our two designer
the the the financial aspect were okay
we we have the cost below uh our threshold and so we could sell at twenty five euros and make i make profit
the the evaluation give satisfying result as well
so i think we can move to the last part of the meeting
so the cost is in the budget the evaluation is okay so i th i think we can now uh open champagne and make a huge party
start to eat banana
i don't know if it's provided by uh by the meeting staff
mm-hmm
okay
okay so congratulation
congratulations to the team
yeah
nice product
uh very well we worked together fantastically
yeah
i think it was a good collaboration uh
so what does the management say
aspect
sorry
what does the management say
i think we will have um much bigger project next time and a much bigger salary as well
ah
all it depends on who watch this meeting
yeah
we don't know
yeah
okay so good guys so see you for next uh successful project
okay
okay
yeah
fruits
mm 'kay
mm
so
we are here to talk about functional design
now hopefully we've all got a better idea from than we did f leaving the last meeting as to what it is we are up to now
so here's an agenda
uh i'll open
um you should know that i'll be taking minutes during all the meetings
as i was struggling to our last time uh and that'll be easier for me now because i'm not actually giving the whole presentation
uh the additional points are just the stuff that we sent and that i forwarded on from upper management having a few bright ideas to make our lives painful
um now you can all give your presentations
we can talk about the requirements and hopefully come to some decisions
right forty minutes for this meeting so a bit more time than the last one
here's the additional points i just wanted to put those in there to see if you guys had any comments
on them
uh did you all receive that email
yep
yeah
so does anyone have any overall
well uh what comes up for me is that if we're gonna if we're gonna be marketing a product that is going to be uh having no teletext
mm
people are very comfortable with the idea of having teletext and using teletext
mm
yep
and so we're not we're gonna be a new product without something that people are very comfortable having right now
so that's from a marketing perspective i i see i see a lack
mm
and so we have to go i think in the other direction
what are we gonna have that makes this thing better than
well tha that first point could uh also be an op opportunity because in seeing that teletext is becoming outdated
some sort remote control that can work with the internet there is the opportunity that's presented i guess
right
yeah
no i i agree with you
so what i'm talking about is i see that one side we're eliminating something so we have to come up with another side which is
okay
what are we gonna be targeting our market uh that identifies our product as better than because it doesn't have teletext it has ta ta ta ta ta
so that's that's that was my reactions
okay
yeah
but but we are sort of being dictated that this should only be for the television
yeah yeah
so we're quite fixed
yep
so we're really probably in terms of marketing are looking for that's uh that's a cost winner rather than a fantastic new feature product
yeah bu but we we're designing only the remote we not design the t. v.
okay
yeah
hmm
so uh we're gonna be removing the teletext out of any t. v.
yeah
that we people use our remote with
'kay
that's right
hmm
i think we take with you
so it's kind of a stupid decision
but there's also the potential for mark there's a market here for our lost teletext
right
for example someone that just goes to the shop that wants a replacement wants it as cheap as possible
twenty five euros is the selling price we really have to innovate here i guess
that's what i'm that's what i'm talking about is is that we have to find something that is gonna be very attractive about this product 'cause somebody
some people are gonna be hap unhappy 'cause it took they can't ac access their teletext
mm
okay
'cause we're talking about eighty percent or ninety percent or ninety five percent of the televisions out there are are teletext
k yeah
so so it's it's not that i'm criticizing the product at all
it's just when we eliminate that then what do we bring
what are we bringing in to take the place of this and we have to d in my opinion we have to double up
mm 'kay
if we lose one we need to bring two or three
okay
okay i think that the last point is probably quite uh straightforward
obviously the the w it has to be branded
so then the double r. will be our our
'kay
on the product yeah
i think one of
can you handle that black and yellow
i tho i tho i thou
i think rol ro rolls royce might mind but don't worry
i think w yeah
one of the things that we should also keep in mind um when we're doing this i mean our company's slogan is we put the fashion in electronics right
so i think our kind of our target here is to have some kind of very like sleek nice look remote and we want it to be functional as well
but i think one of the main selling points is that
we don't want it to be clunky like like this thing here
you know we don't wanna a big clunker
mm
we want something that looks nice and it's fashionable and so
so you have this
nah
so we have three presentations and i think we'll go in
order of participant number here
so we can have a look at the working design first from participant two
that's
yes
okay
that's fine
okay so
mm it's enough
but uh click it on off
so you all know me i'm the industrial designer
and we've some basic components that um our remote is gonna need just basically every remote'll need 'em
we need some kinda of power d power source
um we have to decide on our our user interface which is his department but the in user interface is also a major component
um we need a programmable digital signal processor to um to take the input from the user and translate that into uh
into electronic signal which we pass to the infra red l. e. d. which you aim at the television uh which and it receives that signal
you need a on off switch um i don't know how that got in there
and uh we also need to um have the if we want a universal remote we need to have encryption codes for the different makes of t. v. s
so we need to know all the different you know all the different signals and so that'll require some memory as well
um so here's just a basic layout of how how the remote would work
you ha the v the power source is in the upper right hand corner there
and you can see that uh we have the user interface here which is connected to the chip which does all our signal processing
and then passes that signal on to the infra red l. e. d. and that signal is then emitted and received by the television at the photo transistor
so those are the basic components that need to go into this and everything else is pretty much uh open to move around
now is would this be considered just a standard uh um
i think any des
this is not this is not cutting edge technology we're talking here
we're talking about existing technology
no
right i think
nothing is being modified or upgraded or new discoveries
yeah this is just this is just a basic layout of ev of all the components that w w are gonna be absolutely necessary f to have a working remote
we can add things in like if we wanted some voice recognition
i mean that i mean that you can kinda say would would fall under the user interface and the digital signal processing chip
okay
okay
do we have an idea of costs of different components
but
um well the most the most costly components are gonna be the chip and the uh th it could als basically the user interface and the casing are gonna be expensive as well
um the l. e. d. and the the transistors and everything else are you know they're they're pretty cheap
'kay
so depending on what we want our functionality to be um the chip could be expensive or it could be cheap
um depending on the n amount of memory we need in there and stuff like that and h and h you know how much power
mm 'kay
do we have any ballpark figures for that yet
no
uh i don't have any figures right now
'kay
we uh we have to wait until we get to a more specific design phase for that
yeah
n okay
um but and i think a significant part of the cost could be the actual the actual casing itself and and you know the the b the buttons and things like that
mm
mm the shell
i think
yeah
basically yeah
okay
okay
so yeah
that's all i have really
okay
thanks
and we have participant three which i believe is pedro
i
i can give you that to click on
hey mouse
open
and you wanna get
when we're fighting over it's also more lot more fun
view a slide show that's what you wanna do yeah
just go up to view
uh
click don't yeah
mm 'kay
this doesn't work
so yeah function design
um you guys know me pedro and um
what i found is we want to do fashion and i think honestly we should keep technology low and just simple basically and try to aim for design
if basically a case will will cost the same if it looks good or bad
so we ma we have to make it look good
um something cute and small
the big chunky remotes are died in the eighties
so we should just go for something that people will like to actually look at
and um although mo most people will buy s
televisions and everything for uh that have loads of loads of little functions and everything and they mostly end up using simple functions and little things and most the people won't won't get too mad of actually having to go the to the s to the television to
for instance tune in their the stations
there's no need to have that in the remote
so um
um as for what i would recommend for uh the the interface design and uh i will change the colours on the on the logo
but um we should go for the user oriented device so simple controls and good ergonomics
um and uh although i th i th i'm still here recommending the teletext so i'll remove that i guess but um we should go for the
but i t i think what the the management recommendation was less that there's a worry that teletext will become outdated rather than we shouldn't have it
so i i still think if it's cheap enough functionality wise to include it really should be in there
mm-hmm
because otherwise we're just going to i mean even if it's necessary or not
if you if you're given the choice between a t a remote with teletext or without uh when it really if it i if it isn't more expensive for us to k make because as far as i understand it
it can be operated with the same set of buttons yeah
right as far as i it's just uh the cost of an extra button
yeah
so it should be in there
i mean software wise there's really no difference
yeah
okay
i think
isn't
i have maybe a silly question
i in the very beginning it said with the with the advent of computers there's gonna be the it's gonna be out moded teletext
i i don't understand how those two things are connected
how does how does computers and teletext h how why is one eliminating the need of the other
i don't understand that
well maybe what we're getting into here is the the idea of uh internet through the t. v. for example
so that might play on what we can do
yeah the they're basically aiming at saying that you would use you know a couple of years ago teletext to be the easiest way to check like for uh uh the scheduling and the next programme and stuff like that and now
scheduling
um to find out what what you're watching even if there's commercials you know
yeah and now you can c look it over internet
okay
but i still think teletext is way more convenient until until we have the same commodities
i think i ha
yeah 'cause yeah i just i don't see the cross over between computers and television
i agree
i mean i do see the cross over in some sense but but but but with the the remote is is used for television okay
yeah but it's not happen yet
well for me
yeah
well you have digital t. v. still already
so so if we make the cross over and we're gonna view television on computers then we're then we're losing the the necessity of the remote
yeah
unless you have a
yeah
well there there is a for example on digital t. v. systems you have you can press a button and you can buy things in adverts
s
and you can uh you can view through a catalogue for example
mm-hmm
a a family member of mine has got a system where you just um you can
yeah and there's other features for example on other systems where you can pause live t. v. and things like that
they're just features from the internet uh from computers are are coming into the t. v. sort of under the covers but you still use it through a teletext
okay
so now the things to think here are that that there's gonna be more functionality potentially that we can handle
okay
yeah but we we don't we're not aiming a command for that
that's the thing
and all of those require the other commands with more complexity and more software and
i think a lot of that's proprietary anyways
you're not gonna be able to you like command a tivo with our remote
mm
i don't think
but still there there's an opportunity
if if it's for example a trainable one then we're just simply having like an up down left right
an okay button or something like that might might do as well in future proofing it
yeah but we would increase the price to try to make it a trainable one so
mm
okay
well i dunno
one way the other teletext was there but i guess we can remove it or you know make two separate interface designs
i think if it's possible you should try to you know have a talk with management about that
just you know
yeah i don't i don't see the logic
yeah
i i don't see the logic in elimination of teletext i just i i but i'm not a tech mind either
yeah
yeah and neither do i in fact
i just don't see the cross over between computers and and and 'cause we are designing something for a television okay
bu uh
i'll communicate that back to those guys there a a and th the message really we wanna be sending to them is that
although teletext may become outdated w there's no l logic in not having it in there anyway
yeah
i if it doesn't affect the price
right it's just not yeah
we are selling it to an existing market
yeah
um but i i think what they're pushing us towards here is in terms of thinking of ways to future proof our system for future systems that have something else other than teletext maybe
yeah but we're not putting some there's no no putting anything in in the place of teletext
i dunno i'm
that's
yeah and and yeah and and we're also marketing a product
mm 'kay
that's the problem
it's what i'm seeing is a is a mid range cost product
so so w we can't go and pump a whole bunch of technology into this thing because all of a sudden we are gonna have cost overruns
mm
yeah
so if we drop if we are gonna choose to drop teletext again what are we adding to the product that makes it marketable
hmm
so if we're keeping it basic we're loo loo what we're looking to sell it basically is it's uh just being very easy to use
looking exceptionally good that sort of thing
'cause we really don't have anything else there do we
yeah
i don't i don't see it
and to me if i'm gonna market a product for b for beauty for for design i'm gonna i'm gonna try to market it at a much higher price
i need to make it special with a high price tag
i don't want to make it economically uh g uh competitive
mm-hmm
i want i want to market it as exclusive
so i would market this product it at eighty nine euros and come up with some really beautiful exterior design or something th but but i don't think we have that flexibility
but i if design if design is cheap and functionality is basic
then twenty five euros is probably a high price for a commoner garden stan standard t. v. so the place uh remote the then the place we're going to justify that cost is through through design through making it a a sleek elegant high priced basic remote
does that make sense huh
no i no i i understand what you say but what i'm what i'm okay we probably need to move along but my my concern is trying to find a marketing niche for this product
mm
yeah we probably should
we we're doing alright for time
and if i'm coming in with a with with twenty five euros which is mid market price um then what am i going to give these people for this
yeah
so that's just my question but we can keep talking
okay
sorry that kinda cut into you there
well
no just i i would i would advocate for continuing teletext and those would be the basic commands
um as for you know the the case design uh maybe i'll come up with more concrete ideas
right now it's just the idea of simplicity and slickness cute and small um
right
i'm just thinking you know with all these universal remotes that are out there
how many people how many people actually use every feature that ar you know i like these trainable remotes and things like that
where you know it's just so confusing to do to use all these functions
where
i think the largest portion of the market is just gonna you know they lost their t. v. remote they need another one that'll work with their t. v.
they want something that looks nice that that that isn't gonna break when they drop it
that you know that maybe it's it's ergonomic it feels good in your hand something like that
mm
i think that's gonna be where you're gonna find the biggest you know market share
so we are looking for something that looks good and just works rather than looking for any special features
is that
i think the more bells and whistles we add it's just gonna cut into our into our profits
yeah
because i think as we as we add costs for things like uh for like if we add the voice recognition and things like that
i think you know what percentage of the of the um of the market is actually gonna use that
maybe five percent you know and how much
yeah mm
mm
but we can talk a little bit more potentially in the marketing marketing presentation about this
right
yeah okay
be a good idea
i'm sorry
uh sorry i didn't mean to cut in
yeah
sorry boss
i'm not the boss
okay
oh p pedro i just want to say quickly i i would really like it when you can come up with some more bells and whistles eh
you know sell uh things come to my mind is uh uh something that's uh um voice activated
i know we're getting into some i hope some big money on this thing but
i think that's probably a question more for
is that for over here
for this guy here yeah
yeah
okay alright
well it's kinda both of us
us us user interface
is it
that's
okay
'cause uh and i think of voice activated i think of of how many times i've i've lost my my remote and i can't find it
mm-hmm
so some way that i can i can find my remote by clapping my hands or something uh and and so so um but this 's just something
mm-hmm
i was thinking about that
then your lights would go off though
mm
i'm trying to find some bells and whistles 'cause when they talk about tel taking out teletext it's like what are we gonna put in
what makes this thing attractive
and it's only for televisions
so we everyth our our competition out there has got these these multiple adaptors where they can use 'em for their v. c. r. s
their d. v. d. s their their televisions and we're coming out with one remote for television only
and so to me we have to make this a really special product i i i don't s i really have to say i don't see the market niche for this product
yeah
at this price i don't see it yet
i'm i i go along with this because this is what we're given to try to market but i i don't see the market niche for this product
hmm
without without some really sort of something really special to identify it as as unique in the market
but we th that should be design
yeah
that should be the design basically
right
i think technology we'd we we're not in the price range to do it
we don't have the money to do it towards t f technology so we should we should aim at design
okay
have to do you have to do it in the box
yeah
okay well so so that's up to you then to to make this box in something that's absolutely extraordinary
yeah
okay
maybe make it in the form of a gun
we can sell it in united states
i have a question uh for you
does any of the um the features that pedro's spoken about here have any implications we might not have thought about on in terms of just pure functionality
in terms of making it work or the cost of that or
i don't
i think all these things are pretty standard
i think we'll be okay
okay
'kay
cheers
onto participant four
well you know for marketing f marketing for me is uh and uh how do i go here
okay
mm you can just click
go go
is that right
no no no you just get off that
you just click anywhere
ah ha
yeah what for me is it um i d i don't know what i'm marketing right now
okay 'til you spoke and when i wrote this i don't know what i'm marketing
i just know that i i was identified as a a we identified ourselves as a as a developer
as a manufacturer and as a as a um distributor t to other wholesalers
and so the th the twenty five euros that we've identified as the sale price is a wholesale price rather than a retail price
mm-hmm
that's what we decided here
um so what i did is i i decided that that this this needs to be a product in a in a sense can market itself
so what we've identified here as our main marketing stratagem is is in design
we're making the most beautiful attractive uh whatever we decide it is
so that means we have about seven more minutes or ten minutes left
mm-hmm
um so i would like to have a product that that we can sell easily
so i say inspiration so having something beauty something attractive uh something that in a sense will sell itself
mm-hmm
uh innovation i think fits into what we're talking about here with design
uh cutting edge technology i don't think we're gonna have that these were ideas i was putting together
um unless we come up with some new age product a as far as the casing is concerned
i i wanna make this thing something that i can identify as special in some way so maybe we can have some i i talked about environmentally sensitive
uh maybe we have a product that can be identified in some way as advantageous in a home
i don't know
these are just thoughts
uh i wanted to talk about uh who we are as a as a corporation that we're new we're aggressive
we're competitive we're we're trying to provide a product from a new perspective rather than from an old corporate line
so to me it's about selling d uh our identity our corporate identity along with the product
um what i found is that the projected costs are competitive
mm-hmm
uh we're kind of in the middle of the market but what i'm seeing is that the market is ready for i i identified new technology
but again because what i see is budget restrictions and limitations i don't know that we can bring any new technology into this thing
if if we could have a technological something
i have an idea
mm p please
and it's kind of along the s lines of environmentally sensitive and it may even fit into ergonomics
and even kind of address the issue of losing losing the remote what we were saying it's a common issue
mm
um what we can do is well you know that batteries throwing a aw remotes run through batteries like crazy
solar
yeah
right
and s for some people yeah
well maybe not a solar remote but instead what about if we had like a power cradle
but solar
like a a cradle that is is there to hold the remote when you're not using it
so you'll always know where the remote is 'cause you have to put it back there to charge the remote
and we can instead of having instead of having you know
replaceable batteries we'll just have a power cell that stays there for the life of the remote
you never have to get go through the go through uh all these different batteries
and also you can i i think it's a good opportunity for the user design or for not just for the user design
but also for the just for the look and feel of the remote as as a whole
you know you could have some kind of neat little you know a sexy design for d a cradle and the remote itself
blah i like it
i like the idea but we're talking about in cost is gonna probably double
it w it would increase the cost
but boy we can sell this thing because there's no batteries it's environmentally sensitive i we can identify it as a safer product in some form
and you could page the remote if you lose it
maybe there's a button on the cradle
yep that's right
i really see but the cost i
now the the question is can we make this for less than twelve fifty per
no no
no no we have t we have to change the end cost
there's uh i mean i don't see it anyway
we we well do we necessarily have to change the end cost because uh
can we dl can we do that without uh changing it twelve fifty per product if we basically can sell more based on this
yeah that's gonna be up to these guys
i my reaction is no but
well
what i can do is i can d look into ho well pedro and i can look into how much this might increase our our costs and you can look into what kind of effect an increased cost is gonna have on our on our final numbers
mm-hmm
yeah we we can certainly push for a more expensive product if that's gonna be
well see i i see i i'm an advocate to make this an exclusive product
you know let's let's sell this wholesale for for fifty euros sixty euros
let's make this thing really exclusive environmentally sensitive uh high tech design uh ergonomics all of this
just make this thing uh yeah the the the rolls royce of of remote controls
i i
every home's got to have it
if you don't have one hey what kind of remote do you have
oh you've got one of those oh fantastic i want one of those too
yeah
i just don't have enough money right now
i just don't know about that
because in order to do that in order to price it at that kind of level i think we'd need to have every functionality that all the other competitors are offering like being able to operate
you know the d. v. d. player and you know the stereo system and all that
which is a pretty basic function that w we've opted out of
and additionally we're m maybe not supporting teletext um
nah i think we can say with certainty now that we are supporting teletext
but i do think there are some basic features that we don't have that a lot of other remotes are going to have
yep one one thing i don't understand is h they've they've given us this package okay
mm-hmm
now uh in my opinion we need to give them a package back okay
they say they say okay here you go
they gave us a fundament a foundation of of what they want and and w it's our place to kinda analyse and evaluate
mm-hmm
mm-hmm
i don't think it's our place to create their product for them maybe it is
i don't know what kind of role we have in this in the corporate ladder uh
but to me it's like okay you have got your here's our ideas okay
mm
and then let them look at those ideas and they say yeah well
we can we can raise the price twenty percent you know we like this idea this idea no
but to me it's it's about a choice do we follow their directives or do we make uh presentations back and and then and then discuss
beca i i do not i do not see the market niche for the product that they're handing f handing us right now
mm
i don't see it
i don i i d i have to disagree though
i think our market niche is basically people who need who have lost their remote or uh who've broken their remote and don't wanna send back to the manufacturer
they just wanna run out to the store and get a remote
and then they're gonna look on the shelf and they're gonna see ours is the nicest looking remote
it does what they need
these aren't i i think that it
and and th to get to back to another point sorry uh uh for cutting in but
i th i think it's important to remember that that this remote has to work with multiple t. v. s yeah 'cause it's selling on its own
right
it's not going to be specifically for hitachi t. v. s or or whatever
right
right
no i understand that
so technologically if i understand it uh t. v. s t. v. remote's working exactly the same way as video remotes and d. v. d. remotes
all you need to do is train them to the individual one all you need to do is is know the the f like some four digit code
so saying that it works with all t. v. s is equivalent to saying that it'll work with d. v. d. s and other things
mm-hmm
nope they've identified the product as not working for anything but televisions
yeah y y you you wouldn't
they've identified this product limita that's why i say i don't i don't see the market niche for this
oh okay okay
we have done this
the interface will be different
if we if w if we were going to have a product that worked for d. v. d. s v. c. r. s and everything
i see
then i can see the market niche but we we're only identified as going for televisions without teletext
mm-hmm
and it's like whoa we ha in my opinion we have to go with something that's extremely exclusive to make this thing marketable
right
well here's
and i i'd mm sorry
because who wants just a television remote
right
i don't
we he well here's my thing about that
if you're in the market for this ultimate remote you're not gonna go for just a television remote
if it can't control if it can't control your your d. v. d. player and a al if y if you can't get that all in one ultimate remote
that's right
that just you can throw all your other remotes away
i'm not gonna buy a d seventy five euro remote
i i i have a tendency to agree with you
i really do
so we really can't chase that
that's why i say i quest i q i question the marketability of the product
i really question where we create the demand
so i think what we so that's what i'm saying
we're really looking for something basic
the the one thing that that that you said really struck a chord with me here in that we're we're carrying the corporate identity with the product
but we're actually looking for a large profit at the same time where i'd be inclined to go back to upper level management and say like let's just cut down our profit expected on this product because we are actually branding our company here
we're selling more than just the product
we're trying to get mind share about uh real reaction to to the people who are gonna buy consumer electronics
we want people to eventually say oh that's that's real reaction that's a good m make
it's reliable
and and we're gonna make it we're gonna win mind share by uh either being a fantastic product or for it working
it just being good reasonable priced and solid
so if we can make if we can put an emphasis here on it not breaking i think that's in itself an extremely big thing
mm-hmm
i think that's big
w okay if you if you drop the cost now if you make if you make go to the other side of the cost scale
and you make it less expensive then all of a sudden now we're going into an a a new market area
so we can say low cost uh uh um uh good design beautiful wa da da da da da
good design
we only have a few minutes left
but what i'm saying is right now we're middle market
is twenty five euros a mid market price for a remote
yeah for for multi for a multi function remote that's a mid market price
okay
i think so yeah
in a discount right now you can buy 'em on sale sometimes for about about uh eighteen
nineteen euro and that's for the multi functions uh d. v. d. v. c. r. uh catch alls
okay
and and they have 'em in a little box in the middle and and this is the consciousness that most people have about replacement remote controls
so to me to market this a t only a television remote control we have to change consciousness
we have to have something that will change people's thinking to identify this as advantageous and i don't know what that is
it's gotta be low cost or high cost with with special design features
well i'd be inclined to say if we can make the design better than any comparable remote while reducing the cost
then that's the way we really should play it
yeah
if we can take it down to you know fifteen rather than twenty five and make a low profit margin on it but we're really doing that to sell the brand
yep we have five minutes left
uh rather th uh to to to sell for real reactions
or my d
and i can communicate this to to the more senior uh mm people within the company here to to get a reaction
what about um the idea that i had with the cradle
how do you feel about that
or how does everybody feel
well how does everybody feel
i mean i i well we g we're talking about the other end now
i i think
i like it
i like the idea but we have t we have to find out
no but i that's the thing i i don't think it's necessarily the other end
the other the o the problem with that in my mind i just think off hand as a as a consumer would i wanna buy that
and i think maybe not because i've got a remote and i'll take it to different chairs
i'll take it to different i w i don't wanna go over somewhere and put it down
mm-hmm
it i if it is gonna be somewhere that you put it down then it needs to be at the side of your armchair
right
and that implies that there's only one t. v. user
so it's very good for some people but it's not a like
well it lasts it would last for several hours on its own power but when you're done with it you put it back in the cradle
but it it takes away the ease of use of the remote to a certain extent
yeah well it
you have to l sort of remember
you have to d shift down the side of the couch to find it and put it back and
mm-hmm
mm-hmm
yeah
well
i d i d i d i think it it in my mind it doesn't seem like something that oh i'd really want uh because of that fact
mm
but i i don't know that's just my opinion
well i think again it's it we have a cost issue here
you know if we're gonna go in this direction to me we're going to the other side of the cost range
are we gonna make this selling selling the cost as a high high tech uh um environmentally sensitive whatever
mm
or are we gonna go to the lower side of the range
again i don't see our market niche in the middle for our product yet
i don't see it yet
'kay
so what do we think maybe we should pedro do you have any opinion on it
uh we should keep it simple mm medium low cost mar um cost area and uh make it look good
w a question i have in in a 'cause i i i think i agree with you on we gotta make it a box
the box is gonna sell it i think the outside the casing
really need to wrap up now
can can can we have multiple designs
have a modern have a traditional have a you know and so so instead of them all looking the same
people can have maybe four or five different designs they can choose from
i don't know what that creates cost or
well the the problem with that is we may end up with a whole bunch of inventory of a of a poor design you know
yep one over another
yeah okay i hear that
so
yeah complicated but
um but what we could do is some kind of well i mean
yeah we we need to i mean
have a few designs to look at and then come up with something that i think we all agree is you know the best fit
i think w what's really important is it has to look good it has to feel it has to feel good in your hand
yeah
it has to be durable it has to a and i think it's really important that it doesn't look cheap
i think i think we have to make sure people look at it an and feel like it its like a quality remote
yeah
even though the cost may be low
what ab what ab what about a
a remote that's that doesn't maybe look like a remote
just an idea
mm-hmm
just just okay 'cause i mean we all know what a remote looks like on the outside
they're selling these things everywhere
maybe that could be part of our design exclusivity is we make a remote that doesn't even look like a remote it it opens like a telephone
or what if it looks like a pen
doesn't matter yeah
yeah
i'm just jus i talking about some something to make this thing unique
a pointer
it that's the thing i'm gonna keep thumping on
yeah
i'll sell whatever you guys design
mm
yeah
i don't have a problem selling a product that's not the issue
i give you ideas you guys create the product
once you have the finished product i'll find a way to sell it
don't worry about it
i just give you these things now because these are my thoughts and feelings
okay
so
just to touch on m my point one last time that i had brought up
um i really un unless you guys are die hard against the fact that um it's possible like it reduces the usability of the remote b and the fact that you can't lose it on your own
i think it still might be a good idea to investigate having like a power cradle
yeah
okay
yeah
because i really think i in a certain sense it almost like for me i would want to have that just
because i know at the end of when i'm done watching t. v. that when i'm done
oh i better go find the remote and put it back where it belongs
maybe th th th that's just some people that like that
i mean there's al there's also remote controls i remember that that worked uh
a lot of people
no no
this hasn't been done in a while i think but th as a as a watch
as a watch
yeah there is remote control watches um but i think they're a sorta eighties thing
mm 'kay
so it might not be easy to market in it uh but the the technologies came along and it might be cheaper to make now
yeah they are not simple
those things may have been inexpensive for all i know
mm-hmm
one thing i just thought about when you were saying that
is that the p our target market is gonna be someone who has lost or broken we gotta stop
that's what i was saying
gotta cut up
who's lost or broken their their remote
so how many remotes do they wanna buy
can we p can we sell them a remote that can maybe guarantee they will not need to buy another one
exactly
mm
yeah
and so with with with this kind of system or locator or something to to think about how have people been been losing or breaking their remote
mm-hmm
mm-hmm
how does this happen
the last remote you'll ever buy
and also presumably they've
and and then and then design the product maybe some component of the product that can identify this as the last one you'll ever need to buy
well if if we're going down that then we can we don't need to go the it it strikes me that the locator feature might actually be uh quite expensive to make
exactly
yeah
whereas actually just putting it in a power cradle might not be too expensive at all because that's just done with mobile phones you can just n we we have said we have actually similar products that we can take from and potentially cut costs there
true
right
yeah
the locator'll definitely be more expensive
mm-hmm
um need to look into whether we can do that but uh i think we we have some m mobile phone based products uh checking quickly our internet
we really need to finish up here
uh we can make it in the shape of a coffee pot
but uh
yeah we have the the power adaptor products
we sell power adaptor products
so for example there's nothing stopping us
it's uh just it's that i think it's telling us to stop our meeting
using that technology
yeah
so we have the c we probably have have on line in our in our system we have the ability to create this we're talking about
yeah i think so without it being too in fact we can cut costs through using the manufacturing that's already gonna be in place here
a charging system
right
if if we can create this we have probably five or six or seven really strong marketing characteristics
right
i think one of the things that we can put right on the box is never buy another battery
okay
yep
you know something like that
'kay
thanks guys
yep
no that's not what i want i want
oh look it here
afternoon guys
it's gonna be
rock and roll
oh
'kay
so do we need to re train mike on how to put his mic on
think s
we may do
okay can he get it all by himself this time
i dunno i'm feeling like a big boy
mm
pro
probably not 'cause he's
's been listening to too much
so
he's getting retarded
i believe i can fly
alright well we got some exciting stuff for you guys
yay
or not
or not
yeah
just what i needed was something exciting
remember i'm an old man
'kay ready to go
all ready
'kay so we've got our conceptual design meeting
apparently i'm old as well
hopefully we've all got exciting ideas now
thirty's really young eh
we do
uh k exciting ideas
'kay so here's our agenda our agenda
um
i'm gonna open
i'm gonna talk for a bit about what we're gonna do
i'm gonna take some notes
we're gonna all do a presentation and then hopefully we're gonna make some decisions now
yep
alright
well when i say hopefully we have to
so
i'm gonna let you guys talk before we make decisions
and does anyone really want to go first
i guess i'll go first
you p two
yeah
what's
component i think
components design
yeah
yep that's it
presented by name
my name is
jose he man is
your name is name
my name is name
huh hi name
my name is inigo montoya
you killed my father
sorry i did this in a bit of a rush
prepare to die
n name
so so here's a look inside your really old looking remote control
right
um you've got a printed a printed uh circuit board here
and you've got all these buttons which kinda press down little rubber nubbies into these little holes that activate
we've all broke a remote control ri um s yeah
i've
yeah we've all broken a remote control
so you've also got um you've got your chip here your batteries here and some sorta electronics
um
i just love you tech guys huh
they just
yeah there's a thingy and a dingy and
you press this and it does th
yeah y do jabber
well so you've got here's here's a transistor and this amplifies your signal
um you've got the l. e. d. here on the end of the uh uh on the end of the printed circuit board
um you've got a couple diodes here for i don't know who and whatnot
i dunno who and whatnot
so exactly
nah
so um we've got a i in this in this uh drawing he uh in this example here this is a eighteen pin um uh chip i dunno
p
yeah
uh it's two double a. batteries
this is pretty standard remote
so here are options for our power sources
you can use a basic battery which we've already discussed
um th our tech department also said we have the option of doing some kind of hand dynamo where maybe you crank it or something like that
'kay
i wanna change that
i don't know if that's really i don't know we got some qu crazy guys down there in that department so
i i gotta i gotta flashlight and uh yeah but it's interesting 'cause you shake it like this
okay
you shake it
yeah
like this
so that's the next bullet is the um the kinetic provision of energy so it's like that flashlight where you have to shake it
and that's on the camera
yeah
'kay
uh we've got solar cells
which i don't think is a very good idea because um you could not use your remote at night which doesn't make a lot of sense
mm 'kay
and finally we've got our cradle o our power cradle idea
okay so we basically have battery versus cradle here
m battery versus cradle i think is yeah
okay
i like the kinetic
so we have battery versus cradle
i g i i figured you would
it could be fun
yes
yeah
it's actually a novel thing because you could sell it a as a novelty just to be actually serious for a minute here you could
yeah
well it is it is more uh i mean it is more eco friendly than the than the cradle 'cause you're still using power off the grid with the cradle
mm
so um
hmm
our case design
we have uh choices in materials and choices in the general shapes that we can do
our material choices are a plastic latex um ty or plastic a rubber latex type thing uh wood or titanium
if we go with titanium we're gonna be uh limited in the amount of shapes we can do because it's tough to shape the titanium and uh
yeah pers
wood wood would ge would give us a little bit of a marketing niche wouldn't it
i think wood i i i can't see anybody wanting to use a wooden remote it's just anti technology really you know
it it it
nah
uh
okay
hmm
uh uh to me in a marketing sense it's not it's not relative
we can we can o we can uh accentuate whatever whatever product you put in there we can find a way to accentuate it
right
and what we may be able to do and i think this might be the best option is to combine some a couple of these
okay
um my recommendation personally would be to do some kind of a plastic inner shell with a like a rubber outer shell
to make it um to mak uh like a thick plastic inner shell and a t um kind of a to have that rubber outer shell to make it more durable
and also maybe i i think it feels a little better than the plastic
'kay
do you get a good grip on the rubber
yeah um
yeah okay
and if you make it from that super rubber when you drop it on the floor it can bounce right back up in your hand
yeah
you don't even need to lean down to get it
the advantages of working with plastic and rubber is w we we'll have a lot more um options just in terms of shape because you can extrude plastic in basically any shape you want
so um and then we can cover you know the breakable bits with rubber yeah so um
okay
but basically these are curved and double curved i i believe that the tech department
in their um in their message to me that they were referring to the number of th curves in the bottom
i have no idea exactly what they're talking about but that's what they told me uncurved flat curved or double curved
okay
i would guess this like this pen would be kinda like a double curved where it's curved on m m multiple axes right
i think curved means just curved in one axis and double curved is curved in two axes
okay
or surfaces
i have no idea
i think it might mean something like that sorta shape because a double curve rather than a yeah that's what
mm-hmm yeah that's yeah that's what i see
oh okay oh like a wave okay
yeah that's what i see also
alright that makes sense okay
um okay with the interface we have the following options we can u we can use push buttons
we can use a scroll wheel with an integrated push button and l. c. d. display or multiple scrolling wheels
ooh
um so these are all options that the user interface guy can uh has at his disposal to put together a user interface
okay
for electronics we have these very technical um descriptions here
a simple chip which is the least expensive but i have no numbers to give you a regular chip
which is like the medium porridge the medium expense uh
d do we have actually any concept of what the difference is between a simple chip and an advanced chip
yes the difference is with a simple chip a simple chip will operate oh why doesn't this scroll up
previous previous okay
a simple chip is required to operate push buttons
um an advanced chip is required to to operate um the l. c. d. display and it didn't say specifically
okay
but i i have a hunch that a regular chip is gonna be the scroll wheel and the multiple scroll wheels
okay
so but yeah
yeah that makes sense
that's the end of my presentation
so presentation from
i guess design would go best
next
technical functions or interface concept
i think
oh interface concept
very long presentation
yeah that's it
yes but it has your name on it
well that doesn't bo bode well for it for it tats as well
um so somehow that thing's too big but um okay um our uh manufacturing division wanted the speech recognition
they say they could put it to work but um we don't think so
no
no
it it it you'll be you know be affected by the by the other speech and
if the t. v. is working yeah
that's just i mean it'll if somebody says up in the middle of a
television show it's gonna change the channel
yeah and and fighting for the remote would not be fun anymore and i think that's one of the things we wanna keep
so
but what if you actually had to press a button to make it recognize
so if you pressed it and went up
that kinda would r d yeah
well then why don't you just press the up button
man yeah
that would kind of lose it
but if it's just one thing with a button that you can just go
that's right
even still there's gonna be interf th there's there still will be interference from the t. v.
up
it might not be it might not be completely confusing but i think you'll still y it's still i don't think it's practical at all
yeah okay
i think it's a bad idea frankly
yeah so um taking that away
okay
our uh the the the rubber but rubber buttons are the more reliable it's the the ones that would al would allow us to to market our product as being you know less prone to damage and more resistant to things like spillage of liquids over it or you know mistreat misuses
you guys know your stuff
as it happens to remote controls
um as for the
point that we making about losing it
well we wanna small r remote control one side because uh we want it to be cool and uh designed
but um apparently um market shows that bigger s bigger um remotes get less lost about
that i would believe
mm-hmm
mm
but um yeah i think we we need to compromise between those two and somehow we'll do that
somehow
um so the the what i would propose is something more or less in the uh direction of what is to yo the right of that slide uh but without with a l a less complicated um design
so the numbers the volume control and channel control and teletext access
uh the volume and channel control can just become those the the four button array as in if it was a round dial
mm-hmm
and um if you just think about it as the one to the right but with the numbers and the four buttons plus maybe a centre one with teletext
so we're suggesting doing a sorta scroll wheel thing for the volume
ye no it's not i i it's just four buttons that are on a cross
that's not a scroll wheel
nah
oh okay okay
so that you ba basically can control all of the important tasks from that alone
i see
right
instead of play stop rewind and fast forward there that's up down louder and quieter
uh okay
okay
yeah um yeah so i think we w we go for something mid sized so something looks good and uh is not too prone to get lost
that be it
'kay
so on to
y functional requirements or trend watching
i dunno
trend watching has a later date there
trend watching i guess
trend watching i believe
forty six nineteen fifty seven
see what it looks like
yep
it's been so long
well i don't know what to say
when i s when i see the when i see the product i i i i don't wanna buy it
i see so many of 'em out there
there's nothing about that product that makes me wanna choose that product over other products that are out there
are you talking about the picture
yeah yeah
that's not our that's not our b design
that's just a that's just something he a a graphic he used to show you the layout of what the layout of the buttons might be like
okay
okay
okay 'cause 'cause right now i don't have too much to say about how to market this product because we don't have a product to market yet
and uh from from talking to mike is that we have we have uh we can market a more expensive product now
mm
that's what i understand so hello
upper management said yes
uh e excuse that that's a bit of spam
and and so yeah i'm a i'm a little bit stuck right now in that what uh w what is it that i'm gonna market
uh without special or increased marketable features i don't believe the product has a consumer demand
uh i like the idea of of the scroll makin there are so many people making these products at this price right now
what are we gonna do to make this one special and unique
what's special and unique about a scroll
uh well i don't yeah it's i i just see it as different
it's cool
i don't say it's specially mm
i don't say it's special
uh i say that it's different i what i'm looking for as marketing is m give me something different
i give me a lower price give me a higher price give me some new technology
don't give me the same thing that everybody else is putting out there on the shelf it's f at the same price
i need something to market about this thing
we're we're a new firm
i'd i'd say though that we if we did make the decision to go with the cradle though
what i if when when we have yeah when we when we have something like the cradle or or something give that's as as a marketing standard i need something to market
the then we have that as well but wi with a similar
to make this product unique
well right i think the two big th points that we have so far are the having the cradle and also having uh the um the actual design of the uh case itself having like this like rubber shell maybe with a plastic interior
yep
having it look really nice um and also be really durable
mm 'kay
just remember when i made up this report i didn't have the information that we're discussing here
right yeah
mm
and and so so uh yeah when we have a cradle when we have some kind of design
course
yeah
so what i'm saying is from my perspective i don't have a product to market right now
um uh my personal preference is that we make some adjustment in the cost either lower or develop an integrated new technol technology
that's that is the next step there's technology and then there is technology which we're moving into the next phase
yeah 'cause that's
and so uh we're gonna have some new technology to enhance the marketability
yeah uh again i'm not sold on the product because we don't have a product in my opinion yet
mm
so i need a product
mm 'kay
well let's get a product then
i need a product to market
and i just whatever product you guys put together we'll find a way to market it
tha that i'm not concerned with
so now
if you if you give me if you give me a cut out of what everybody else has then i need to i need to find a lower cost
so our big questions here really are
cradle or not cradle
do we go basic or do we go for features
uh d does anyone really wanna do anything with the scroll wheel or should we ditch that off hand first
well my question is what would the scroll wheel do
function wise what does that do that
oh but that was in your presentation so wh what would you imagine it doing
yeah wh wh what's the wh
yeah
well it's it's just another way to do the exact same thing that the buttons do
mm 'kay
okay now what i see with the scroll wheel is everybody has buttons
but would we
so from a marketing standpoint i have i have another door to walk through when we have something that's unique
yeah
if it creates something more complex or more expensive then i don't know if that makes it uh a marketing necessity
but again from a marketing perspective i want as much new and different about this thing as possible because we're we're co it's a very competitive market
what i understand about scroll wheels is they're they're quite expensive to to make
yeah
th they are gonna be more expensive but on the other hand i mean it
so i d
i mean it is an alternative if if you think that's gonna sell some some uh you know if if we're gonna make up the extra cost by extra sales i think maybe it's worth it to do it
but i mean i would just use if i was gonna do this i would just use the scroll wheel for s channels up and channels down
i don't think volume or do you think volume would be
i dunno
i'll bet first in volume maybe
i dunno
no we can we can do multiple scroll wheels but
well i d i like the idea of basically focusing the my personal preference is focusing the p the product on the idea of the uh the case the the uh
dock to put it in to to charge it
we can target like environmentally friendly ideas that sorta things
mm-hmm
it s i m makes it easy to market it's easy to differentiate the product yeah so
yeah yeah
i think it's that's right
i think so
and if we we keep the rest in a format that is durable because th th the whole product's gonna need to be more durable th thus because you're not going to be ditching it as often
mm-hmm
it's gonna need to be more expensive because of the cradle
mm
so if we can market it in terms of that and yeah well
yep
i think we got some exclusivity in that you know we got something that nobody else has right now
yeah
and and that means we can we can make some adjustments in the retail or wholesale price if we need to and it also can create it's own demand from it's uniqueness
so our big decision then is like how do we do um like we have to decide on the details and we have to decide on well n not exactly the details
but d do we have uh
what type of casing
i personally like what you were saying about the plastic with the rubber
mm-hmm
i'm thinking yeah something like kinda almost like these pens you know
where there's you have plastic bits and then it's not really rubber but just kinda like a fused the plastic with rubber on the outside
okay
just a very thin sorta sheet for a a grip sorta thing or for
well no ma yeah maybe a bit more then th is on here but ju just as a kind of an inspiration
these pens i think are are kind of
okay
so then if we d d do we want to do anything more basic with the uh more advanced with the user interface in terms of do we want to go for um buttons
or do we want if we're ditching the scroll wheels do we want to go l. c. d.
do we want to give do we want to have anything else on it
it's only a t. v.
or from from my perspective i think l. c. d. is a mistake because this is a universal remote and all you're doing i mean it's you're not gonna get any information back from the television
so the only information you can display on this remote is what channel you just sent it at last and there's just not a lot of information
you know there
hmm
it receives no information
okay
so i i don't see any reason for having an l. c. d. 'cause it's an increased cost
unless you can think of something interesting to do with it
yeah
yeah right now there's right now there's nothing coming out of the t. v. to receive
so you know unless technology changes and information starts coming out of the a cable box or something there's no s i don't see the
right
i don't see the necessity of an l. c. d. either
don't see it
okay so the question is now i guess we need t to
decide on well y you guys basically have to now go and
figure out the details of this thing
so
what we need to know in terms of marketing and uh project management are are there any other questions that we need to answer now before you guys can go and build this
what what overall things have we not decided on
well we have to i think for me it's still not exactly clear exactly what the inter user interface is gonna be
there's the scroll wheel in or out
what do you guys like in the user interface
i think maybe in terms of marketing is that gonna make enough of a difference to justify the cost
again
well i think it's it's the more uniqueness you can bring to the product the easier it is i believe for me to market
uh again the push buttons i i see are are everywhere
and so we can go with the same thing but we're gonna be com competing in a in a broader market than if we go with something unique
you know the other thing i thought about was you know do we go to something like this
make a remote that doesn't look like a remote
it's just another it's just a an idea and i don't know
well i dunno about like the flip phone idea because i think as far as durability th it's not a big well maybe when it's closed
i mean what i see one of the things one of the things you brought up in an earlier presentation is
mm-hmm
when you got children their their stuff gets inside the circuitry they get dirty they get messy with drinks and stuff
this
mm-hmm
and what i keep throwing out there i just keep throwing out ideas to try to make this thing look or act or in some way identify itself as unique or different
mm-hmm
but you guys are the ones that have to c ultimately create the product within cost
yeah and i guess th th the question th th that you're being asked right now is whether is the dock enough of a unique feature to be able to go out and sell that a a as a a very different product
or do we really need the scroll wheel as well
because the scroll wheel comes at quite a cost
oh okay phew
yeah
i think you gotta g get into cost effectiveness
i think if you can have the base station with a with a locator
i think those are two very strong features if that's something that can be integrated without a bunch of extra cost
well
the
the locator's gonna require a radio transmitter which will
mm-hmm
that's gonna n is that gonna need a better chip as well
um we're probably gonna have to go with a like a medium chip s i would imagine
no it's just different
but we i we will need a receiver an antenna
integrated yeah
yeah
so it's just uh i i think that's
it should be a really simple signal though so
i know personally that would be a very attractive feature is to have a uh have a button i can push to find my remote control
and it's presumably gonna need a little speaker in it or something like that as well to beep
that's true yeah
but i guess a little tiny speaker is gonna be quite cheap it's not gonna need q quality is it
oh yeah yeah
it's
it'll be really cheap
or maybe you can like have a a smell o rama you know you push a button and it s puts out a stink
you can
maybe not
makes your living room more fresh as you watch
yeah yeah yeah yeah
okay we're doing well for time here
s
um we've got about another ten minutes
i think that uh
so the scroll wheel
in or out
mm pr my personal preference is out
i don't think the cost is justified for a little bit more uniqueness when we already have that
and i don't s think it's obvious and natural how it would be used
yeah
yeah i think we have like and it's not very usable and it will bring down the robustness of the whole thing 'cause it's it it breaks down easier
mm
yeah
for me i think the scroll wheel actually might not be so bad
i don't know exactly what the increased cost is gonna be but i think he does have a point
i it might push somebody over the edge when they're looking at our at our remote versus something else
when they see this one has a scroll wheel to go up and down on the channels
i think it might be kinda neat to be able to do it like that
but then that that surely d depends a little on the t. v. because some t. v. s are quite slow at changing channels from like so if you've got a scroll wheel and you s you have to scroll scroll it really really slowly just so that you're actually keeping in pace with the t. v. 's ability to to change channels
w
sure
or do you have to go through and you wait for it
yeah
you scroll it a bunch of times and you wait for it to
well i think wh what it would be is like like the m like this where it's maybe you know a digital
wheel right where it's where it's quantized into you know certain
mm
oh yeah
uh i see i see
that's where you
yeah
that was that was my my intuition of what the scroll wheel would be
ah i see i see what you're talking about now
okay
it's just it's basically it it's just a f look and feel thing
it has the same exact functionality as two buttons
i i think there's you know that uh there are so many people today that are that are surfing are television surfers
and i see the scroll as a as a great mechanism for surfing
instead of going button to bu you just j you'd j j j j j j
yeah if you're just sitting there going
yeah
i really i really think that's a really cool thing for surfing
that's kinda cool actually
i like that
now just just so you know though uh you did bring up a point which is very valid
is a lot of t. v. s won't re the t. v. s won't respond exactly the same
some of them are gonna be kinda slow switching so you may like queue up like fifteen channel changes and it'll be like flip flip flip
well there's ano
but
well not n necessarily
you could basically make it so that it'll i mean it's just gonna be sending a signal to the t. v. yeah the t. v. 's ge so if you send about five flip channels
right
that's right
if you did that it's gonna flip once
if you do that
yeah it just might be frustrating where you can't make it go as fast as you want
other than click click click
but i think once people get used to it i i do like the idea of the scroll wheel though
yeah
and if we're marketing it as a high niche product then we're gonna be selling it to people who are buying good t. v. s as well yeah presumably
mm-hmm
yeah i think so
primarily
i i think so
yep
now the the only thing i i on the interface side of it is that i i i see the dilemma
but if we have the option of of scrolling at any particular speed or the option of jumping direct okay
mm-hmm
so i can go uh presuming i have on my television
something that tells me what channel i'm on i can scroll direct from channel five to channel thirty two
i know what because it's on the television
the television tells me what channel it's on when i change it
so i don't know that really that's that's gonna be a a d problem
'cause the television can go automatically from channel five to channel thirty two with the push of a button
mm-hmm
okay
so ca can we can we create that kind of interface within a scroll system
you understand what i'm saying
i think i know what you might be getting at or or
oh i see so if maybe if we had an l. c. d. up the top that just did a number on it right
oh no we could read it from the television
and then it that basically
well what about this what about if you can programme in your favourite channels into this scroll wheel and you can just like roll through your favourite channels
mm
well that's quite cool
and it c it
you'd need a display on the th the thing
why
it'll tell you when you flip the channel on the t. v.
yeah the the television can tell you
yeah
can
oh yeah yeah no i see what you're talking about
yeah that's kinda cool
how would you program it though
well you just it's one extra button
you say programme start and then type in 'cause you still have the typing you know you'll still have the keypad where you can type 'em in manually
put
okay okay
so programme start zero one enter zero five enter thirty eight enter programme end
and then
okay and yeah and that just basically flips between it and it'll go it sends out zero
mm-hmm
five and then thirty six and then zero one again
mm-hmm
yeah that's kinda cool
i like that
and again we have another another great marketing tool
we have about three we have three or four things here
that's not gonna be too expensive because that's gonna be you're gonna be able to nab that off of computer mouse manufacturers really
mm-hmm
you could basically come up with a partnership to be able to produce that quite cheaply
i dunno and an maybe we maybe even have this as in house technology
yeah
this may be something that's available through our own uh through our own services
might be but tha that's not gonna be such a costly feature
the problem we're gonna have is making it robust
oh well we also have to determine in some manner how to switch between modes between going through your favourites list and just hitting up one up two
making it last
or we go directional up we go we go this we go this we go this way for one we go this way for the other
so if there's a button for each type
no because you wanna be able to go up and down through the channels
yeah people are gonna have their favourite sorta whether they do that or whether they
ah ha okay
okay okay well then you just have you have a diff you have a mode switch
right
i think we'll need a we'll need a mode switch but then if we have a mode switch we're gonna need some kinda indicator
yeah yeah the mode switch
just the lights behind the buttons
to which an l. e. an l. e. d. okay
you could have back lit buttons maybe
yeah
would that work
is that okay we have five minutes
okay
so right details th that we've talked about here are that we want a scroll wheel
we want a mode indicator
we want back lit buttons
and if we're making back lit buttons period
do we want that just for the mode indicator or maybe to indicate what button you're pressing at the time
so that you know if it's actually pressed or not
i've seen some remotes do that
okay
just so you know i think i mean it was my understanding that before we were gonna stay in the mid market range
it seems we're kind of approaching a higher end range
yeah yeah
i think we are yeah
i wanna make sure everybody's okay with that
well you had acknowledged that we have more money for this
yeah well we don't have it's not that we have more money we can push up the the price
didn't you say so
that's what i mean
we can increase the cost
yeah
okay
so i don't know i don't know whether having
'kay
i just wanna make sure everybody's on board with it
so
yeah
so we really need to be sure as to what we can push the cost up to
though we haven't got to a stage where we're ready to pin down the price of components
but i'd say what sorta price are we looking to be able to sell something like that and what sorta price can we make it for
well i think th i think the design and technology has to come back and say
okay to create this product we see it's gonna cost us this much for this volume
because we do have a volume target of of fifty million profit
yeah no i i think that's where we really should be more flexible than anything else because as we said in the last meeting
our management is really looking for us to push our brand
right
we're entering a new market here so i think the the profit expectation for this one product is maybe not as important as being able to
okay i'm i'm okay with that
i guess what i just want to me the next step is for these guys to come come in with the design proposal w with the cost estimate attached
and then we have to take this to the next level
but th what's our ballpark as to what we'd be able to sell something like this for
well y yeah
let's let's try and think now how much would you pay for with all these features how much would you pay if you went to the store
we have to find cost
and you were in the market f to replace your t. v. remote how much would you pay for that
but you've gotta think who our target market is because i i'm not our target market
i'm just asking you
i'm a student but
if
on the other hand i would think
mm with my project manager salary i would think yeah i could probably afford this uh would i buy it
then you could probably afford this
maybe
if i had a cool new t. v. and this was r looking really slick and it had the dock and it had the scroll wheel
which i think's a really cool idea that would sell me on it a little
then maybe you know
i do i don't think i'd go over a hundred euro certainly that would be way too much
oh no no
but the i would be happy paying over forty for it i guess but not much
i would say thirty five to forty
yeah i was gonna say thirty five to fifty
'kay
thirty five to fifty euros is our sales bracket okay
okay
so the question is what we ca we make it for
because one of th one of the things we're marketing about this product is that this is the last one you will ever need to buy for your television
right
mm
it's one of the marketing features in this
that's why the scroll needs to be really robust
okay so we'll come up with something between thirty five and fifty that is rug rubber robust with scroll wheel
with the new facilities of the scroll wheel like favourite stuff favourite channels and and with a cradle and yeah and the locator
mm-hmm
with a cradle radio transmitters
and back lit buttons
and it's gonna look sexy
or not
or not
it might look like clay
okay so you can market pe depending on that
yeah yeah
bas th that's that's easy
that's that's not a it's a
'cause we have about six six seven features in that alone
yep
under the title of uniquenesses
cool
hmm
okay
the next meeting starts in thirty minutes although does it
it starts at three twenty one the next meeting
so we've got more than a thirty minutes
um we've got more like fifty
well i have
is my three twenty one is the next meeting
the the ne next meeting is three twenty one yeah
that's that's almost uh fifty minutes
yeah that is
uh they've they've changed the times from the presentations
you guys can
you guys you guys can uh create a
all kinds of things
probably
we'll let you know when we're done if we can go earlier
thanks yeah
okay so you guys will be getting your modelling done now and uh
yeah
okay are there any other questions with regards to what this thing's gonna do look like
how it's gonna work that need to be addressed before we really look at this in a lot of detail
i don't think so
if we have any questions we'll just email you i guess
okay
yeah i think it pretty much everything's covered
okay
this one was quite easy
coulda been worse
still
always the optimist
yes i am
'kay thanks guys
thank you
i don't have any emails
this means i can go home
oh we all leave
uh 'kay
so
so so so
put on your mic
so you forgot how this works again
boss
yep
boss
maybe
maybe maybe maybe
okay so we're here to talk about the detailed design of the product 'kay
yep
and here's the agenda for this meeting
uh i'm just gonna open say a few boring words to start with again and start taking minutes afterwards
you guys are gonna give us a presentation of our wonder product that i can see some demonstrations of over there
looks cool
and then we're gonna evaluate it
bra
then we're gonna talk about finance and i've got a lovely excel spreadsheet that i knocked up in the last five minutes for this
hmm you knocked it up
and uh yep
and we're gonna evaluate the product and close
got forty minutes to do this in
we should be fine
let's try and keep this one on schedule
alright
so
your
thing is in where is it
thi third third third
is it in
three three
the end product thingy
yeah
who wants it
pedro can have it
i like i'll help talk
um yeah so what we ended up with
production costs estimated by our manufacturing department and um the research department which is us is uh fifteen point eight euros
someone forgot the units there yeah uh unit price unit production price cost thing
unit price
um
we implemented the basic functions which is just t. v. functions plus the locator which was one of the marketing things cradle
scroll wheel for uh the the channels
and uh we implemented the f the the way of putting the new and revolutionary zapping your favourite channels functionality in the scroll
zapping your favourite channels eh
yeah
scrolling through your favourites list
oh okay okay
zapping you know zapping
ah 'kay okay that's favourites
maybe it's just a portuguese thing
and um yeah that was the result
ah 'kay
i like the the the the logo on there as well
it's very prominent
it is very prominent
so this is the
so here i'll give you the so this is the cradle unit and this is the actual remote itself
um so the scroll bar is or the scroll wheel is this this green little scrolly guy here um and then the volume controls are here and here
okay
uh you've got the keypad which is the numbers uh f from zero to nine and then ten
this is the power button
uh we have our um we have the enter button and uh what was the other button here
this is the teletext
start s the the start uh to to to programme yeah
the programme button yeah the programme button
ah okay i see
so this bl this button will be used both for the favourites and for programming your uh the um the type of television you wanna use
so um the plastic is the white area of this of the model here and the red area is like a rubber covering
so you can see that when it lays like this or like this and the buttons are all gonna be rubber
it's pretty cool
so it's pretty hard to actually damage it um
is that could that be easy to for the scroll wheel to be rotated if it lands on it
yeah that might be a possible
a mi uh possible problem but if you drop it yeah
not helping
oh well i guess it depends on the stiffness a little of it
yeah and it depends on if it's sliding but i think it's pretty ergonomic
you can feel it
mm
feels good
i take it that this is gonna be slightly lighter in the final design as well
yeah of course
well this is clay
yeah it's kinda cool
you have to reach a little bit don't you
yeah the the power button is a bit of a reach but i think we might scale down the final model a bit
ah yeah that wouldn't make sense
these this is a bit larger than it would be but
it's cool
i'm impressed
don't have no one to handle that
mm that's oh that's oh i like it
and hold it so wh what's the marketing perspective
i mean you guys gave me more than i was asking for so i'm happy because we've got some really marketable features in this
yeah i think it's good
good good good job
mm pedro can demonstrate the the paging ability
yeah
so you ha you have like the the base station with um the little button for the where's my remote
beep beep beep
uh pla
the locator function
i'm ha
okay
it's great
that's great
it's a great feature
um beep beep beep so beep beep beep beep beep beep be shut up
mm it's impressing
wicked isn't it
so let me get it if i press this button
i see
that's pretty cool
hang on
so you can take this ho take this home with you tonight and you can push that and he'll be across town
beep beep beep okay
i plan to do that as well
um no no no tha that's alri
so the the two blue are are those for the the it to charge off of in
exactly that's exactly what those are for
ah okay okay
and um there's one other feature that we were debating but we decided to go against it
is um you could beep beep beep we were thinking that it might be interesting to have a trigger button here because you have this finger it it's it kinda feels like there should be something there
yeah it's the right shape isn't it
but we couldn't figure out what button is important enough to put there
and we we don't wanna accidentally be hitting the power button like that so
but maybe if you had a trigger plus the scroll then that would get past the the problem of it landing and scrolling
mm
right
'cause then it would need to be hit on both sides
so maybe in a final design phase we might tweak that a little bit but
okay
uh i can see that
but it's definitely got options for like different types of models and things as well based on that hasn't it
mm-hmm
yep i like
good job
so is that the the final colour scheme as well or
no no
oh no this is just what we had to work with at the time
okay
so we'll leave the colour scheme up to the marketing people
the hmm
careful
it came off
the scroll wheels a problem with them not being sort of
well i mean of course i mean
i don't think the user interface guy wants to touch it anymore
my my s my suggestion is we're gonna go go to the silvers and blacks like most of the televisions
mm
you know some blend of silvers and blacks
beep beep beep
okay enough of that
well i it's cool guys
'kay so are we done with the this presentation
yeah
ja
okay
now now
so you're not gonna find my uh my folder up there i gotta do mine up at the board
have you
okay
yeah yeah
so
can i not get your get at stuff from your shared folder now
no it's not in there because i had the computer problem and i i i cou i couldn't create it
oh i see i see
i couldn't create it in the powerpoint and i think i've got this really strange cable
so what i had basically going from the powerpoint format is that uh yeah yeah i like this a lot
is this one of the tests is to see how we can adapt to s changing situations in the in the meeting room
nah
so what we had is we had the method
that's not how you spell method is it
no way
no a.
so this doesn't go so fast this way
and when i speak about method i speak about the marketing of the product huh
and uh to me with this product we got uh we got basically three things to market
we've got the features
we have the uh characteristics
and we have the i i don't know what we would call the other part what we call you know the the the
corp corporate
help me
the the corporation stands behind the product okay
so the features i think we got the scroll we've got the uh the locator we've got the durability
it fell off
we've got the dependability we've got you know the features that make this a unique product
beep beep beep
um
the characteristics i talk about we have reliability we have comfort we have ergonomics we have environmentally s sensitive
uh and the corporation we're talking about we're we're a new we're a new company
we're wanting to make a name for ourself
we're wanting you to uh find our product so we're gonna give you a good product at a fair price
one thing i would want to to see is uh is can we can we get a lifetime uh guarantee on this product
a normal use guarantee which means that this product for the for the life of of the life use
if it should have a technical problem that we could re replace it at no cost
that was something i would be interested in
um so yeah without uh going into great details we have a we have a product it has the features and the characteristics and the background
i believe to make it marketable i believe at a cost of of of thirty thirty five to to fifty euros
we're gonna be competitive and we're gonna we're gonna have a market niche
um w
do you would you a argue that that we're better going for the higher cost than bringing it down into twenty f five as we probably could
but lowering our profit margins
that that would be uh that would be i think a decision best made by corporate um i i m for my evaluation based on what our competition is
i th i think that that we can go after this and and and go after more of the uh exclusivity sense than the mass market sense
mm-hmm
mm 'kay
but i'm sh i'm sure open to to market this in either direction
but you guys came up with a great product and at that cost i think it uh there's nobody else that's putting this this combination of of ingredients together
the only limitations i see to this is that we're focused on television only
uh that's the only that's the only drawback i see to this
but with all of these other features i think people c one thing i'm i'm hoping for is people are not gonna even notice
there's gonna be somebody going home and say oh sh this thing doesn't work for my d. v. d. and my but i like these other things
so they keep it they don't take it back
and we're actually quite open to be able to expand the product for a later version with those features quite simply anyway aren't we
th there's no fundamentally different technology to do that
well one of one of the thoughts that i had is can can this unit be be produced in a way that makes it upgradable
you know uh like like a um a sim card in a in a um in a telephone
hmm
you know is there a card in th can we make a card and so after
w we need we need we need s some more buttons if it would to work on some other stuff but
mm-hmm
mm-hmm but you follow what i'm s i'm s
we we w yeah we could get another version of it that actually works
yeah 'cause if if we can make this unit upgradable then we're yeah but then we talk about changing the warranty concept and everything
but uh
but that's that was just an idea i had
uh to me the only additions
yeah the plus there's the the risk of making it unusable as well
or making it less b because at the moment it's actually very straightforward to look at all the buttons
you know what they do it's very simple and it just works
yeah
yep
mm there's a risk of that
but anyway that's uh
okay so we can talk about finance now
so i have a little spreadsheet for us where i i was wondering
you when you talked about the fifteen point eight euros i was wondering how you came up with that figure
well that was just just our technical team added up the um production costs of the individual units
okay so i have bit of a spreadsheet here for this
very co very colf colourful
now
oh
i've made a f few assumptions here in that i'm assuming that our power adaptor we can make for a cost of four euros
uh-huh
equivalent to solar cells which i think is probably fair considering that we have in house manufacturing of power adaptors already
uh-huh
uh and i'm assuming that the locator beacon the you know the
mm-hmm
yeah
beep beep beep
can be made for it sounded different that time uh can be made for a similar price to uh an l. c. display uh an uh
oh sorry
uh do you think that's fair coming from a m the manufacturing
yeah um i do think we that we we uh don't need the events chip on print
we only need the uh the regular chip on print so there may have been a m miscalculation in there
okay
yep
okay
so we're down to sixteen point four yeah
and we and we have a single curved uh
is that a single curved rather than a double curved
uh i think that
we've got a we've got a curve and a droop
we're not entirely sure what single curve versus double cur
i don't know whether that
it's single curved yeah
you think
okay i'm convinced
but we save one euro that way yeah
so we come bring it down to
fifteen point four
see it's a little bit more than f single curved
so yeah it's fifteen point eight that's where we came up with it
well hang on
do don't speak so it's in here in that w do we have any we have special form don't we
okay
yeah
yeah we do
so that's yeah
ah
but the the the we haven't talked about any special colour though uh i don't th if we're going for greys and silvers then i don't think we're
what do you know
oh it's a that's not very special it's pretty
o okay so we're
if th
push button scroll wheel we're basically we have uh th is this intended to be a button as well or just a scroll
we don't
it's a scroll
that's a scroll
just a scroll
it's not one of the scrolls where for example with this one you could push it down to be a button
uh no we just use it as a scroll
ooh
okay then we have fifteen point eight euros
it was a pretty accurate estimate i would say
it wasn't bad
yes
yeah
we're wicked
awesome
okay so
we're on to the
s 's kind of s frighteningly accurate
yeah
we're on to the pat on the back part of the
presentation where we have a look at the criterias th that paul the criterion criteria that paul has has given us and we can use that to tell
how's it going
anyone got any thoughts
what
how how have we done today
i think we did pretty well
yeah
i think we did pretty well too
that looks pretty spectacular
no i think we come up with a with a attractive marketable um product and and concept
any other chang uh thoughts
okay so th th what about um room for creativity
that was mm-hmm
is it the
sh i think there was plenty of room
yeah
i i think we we ended up being quite creative there
we got a couple innovative i
yeah well we we we kinda broke we kinda at least adjusted every every criteria they gave us because we d we still have the the teletext capability in this thing right
couple innovative ideas
mm
no
mm-hmm
we raised the price of it we've added two t new technology to it
yeah
so you know you know if this thing flies then we've we've adjusted or broken every every idea they gave us
not every idea necessarily it's still a remote control
basically
yeah yeah yeah yeah
uh no yeah but we did we did break with the specs a little bit i guess but the uh
but i like i mean when i say we have we had i believe we have room for creativity 'cause w this is we did it
'kay leadership what do we report back to the bosses
no th th i think they were r reasonably flexible with us over the whole changing the specs thing
it was more of a teamwork thing then really leadership based project was
yep
i agree
teamwork
cohesive yeah
synergy
yes synergistic yeah
there was a lot of synergy
teamwork yeah he is uh
yeah
what did we think of the meeting room i guess is an important thing here
these cables suck
mm
yeah this falls off and uh the white board worked really well without any pro
yeah
yep
and that's
yeah
d you must have very long shirts
that's way far down lapel mic
mm mm lapel
lapel lapel lapel
wha okay oh alright
lapel
that's almost a crotch mi cr
that's it's down it's quite close
you know you know what they're gonna have on the recording in there from that microphone is your lunch digesting you know th
keep it keep it calm
oh dear oh dear
oh dear
no more pizza for me
so yeah the the pen came in alright and it's a little uncomfortable to use but i guess it works
'cause this is you were using it o upside down
still that
that's our boss
nah i'm i'm not convinced of that at all
i've been wor i've been wondering about that all day but see these look like they're that looks the oth that looks like it would be that way around
use them like that
pedro's right
but it feels more comfortable wh what you call upside down
pedro's right
i don't care
uh okay so that data might be slightly invalid
what new ideas have we found
oh wel
new ideas f uh for the product or for the the the the environment or what are we ta
well let's do both then
uh for the product
well we had the favourites list and the scroll bar and we have the cradle
and the r uh remote call feature
oh
yeah we came up with quite a bit
bunch of new ideas
and for the meeting room has anyone got any more
yeah comfortable headsets would be nice
yeah less sore on the ears
well i i mean clearly remote control microphones would be the would be a nice solution to all these cables
mm
but i'm sure that there's there's some justification for these things that i don't know about
and of course i did not have so much fun with my computer this afternoon
it's not been uh it's not been cooperating so well but i don't think that's the
that's avoidable
coulda been worse
okay so
are the costs within the budget
mm n no
no
nope
oh hang on it really that's something we that the costs were under twelve fifty euros
no requirements are changed
we're still under twenty euros to build so we're good
and the costs within the budget
not the original budget but they are now
is the project evaluated
mm i think so yeah then celebration as it says
hooray
okay
free coke provided at the cafeteria
all right
oh i don't know how that got there
uh anyway
who wrote that one
thank
so we need to close this meeting yeah bravo
thanks guys
congratulations
cool
good job guys
s i've got a lot of paperwork to catch up on so let's close this and come back and 'kay
yeah i've got a lot of paperwork to catch up on too
oh
so we can start
yeah
suppose i have to do my presentation
ah okay
eh um
it's ada longmund
so i'll present myself i'm ada longmund and as you may know it i'm the pr project manager
so um we will have to
um speak about m the project
our project project is to create um a new remote control and as you may know there's lot of industrials interesting in creating a remote control
so the remote control has to be original trendy and um user friendly
record
so the project method is the following
so if we're um the functional design you have to do uh any individual work and uh also work with uh meetings talking with each other
uh it will be the same for the conceptual design and also the same for the detailed design
uh
the tool training is to try out the white board so
mm-hmm
maybe someone ha we have to this whiteboard yeah
maybe you can draw your favourite animal
and make a list of its favourite characteristics
so right now
i don't know if we have to do it now maybe later later
so yeah i think you can do it
yeah i don't know
so the selling price of the product will be twenty five euros
twenty five euros
mm
yeah
yeah
i think it's quite good price yeah
i it's it's reasonable s quite yeah
it's reasonable i think yeah
twenty five
and uh
is
it will uh be a
an international remote control as we want to sell it in the entire world and the product costs will be not more than twelve euros and fifty centimes
so as you will discuss about the remote control you will have to experience your um with the remote control
um just uh maybe be imaginative with remote const con controls try to create something new and people would like to to buy
and and the next meeting will start in thirty minutes
so you'll ha all have your spethisfispis specif specific role and you know i suppose you know what you have to do
yeah
and uh you will have to work on the design and also to work on the design of th technical fun functions of the remote control and think of the user requirement specifications
i i hope so
those things just refer to each of each of us i think
yep
yeah
ami and okay
i. d. yeah
yeah
so
i. d. is for the industrial design yeah
okay
and u. i. d. it's for the user interface designer yeah
that's me
okay and marketing expert it's me
ami yeah project
so i will manage all all the group
you will be the manager yeah
you can manage all this yeah
okay
good
so you have questions
um
not really
so you all know what the parts of the work you have to do
yeah
so which you the industrial designer
no i'm user interf i'm user interface design
i am the industrial design yeah
okay
mm-hmm
and you
i am the industrial designer so
mm okay
okay
yeah
so what's the difference between
user interface design d industrial design
hmm
i mean you have to know
ah you have to know it
it's difficult
it's your job so i hope you you know what it is
you know very soon
yeah i think so
so
mm
i suppose you have to design it and you have to take care of the industrial way to transform it
okay so i make uh u user interface
yeah
you you de you implement the core functions in the
and i maybe you will transform it
i i think the user the user interface design is he will design how the user will you know the relation between the user and you know the remote control so
use it
make make yeah
and the uh industrial design it is how the object will look like
maybe i think uh uh i industrial design's uh it's the function design
yeah
so the materi
i design the user f user interface you design the function
maybe it is the outside and the inside
yeah
okay
okay right
okay
but i was thinking that he's a user 'cause the user interface to design for example where the but button will be you know
yeah yeah
but i don't know
okay
well
you know
i'm the industrial designer
oh okay okay
not the other one
so
okay
okay
so and the marketing expert will
yeah
i'm just go i'm trying to give you some trends about what should be done and what the users would like to have and then thi this would i guess converged to the user interface designer wi and then industrial designer
and yeah
ok okay
and when designing y the remote control just remember that uh it has to be a kind of international product
okay
so you don't have to do something really specific as everybody everybody will have to use it it's sor the same as keyboards
mm-hmm
mm
yeah
you know you have qwerty azerty french and u. k. keyboard so really the remote control to be international
mm
yeah
okay
mm-hmm
and not too expensive
yeah
and uh simple
as we want to maximise the benefit
and easy to use
and you have to keep it under twelve euros and f fifty so
yeah you have to keep in mind that the product cost won't be maxim more than twelve dot fifty euros
ah yeah
that's the problem
it should be
okay
okay
and to be sure that really people will be interested in buying a new remote control with maybe new functionalities that don't exist in the mm existing remote controls now
okay
so is it okay
mm
yeah
it's clear
there was a step about drawing something in the in the board i don't know
yeah maybe should go and draw an animal
is it
are we supposed to do right now
yeah yeah you try
try first
oh right it's it's from the left to the ri it's
so you think we have to do it now
i d i was thinking but i n i'm not sure now
you can draw something which is very simple
oh
you want me to draw something
everybody
product manager okay let's go i will try
oh maybe we should bring kemy here
kemy is really good at drawing
many
i think everybody should do it so
yeah
it's not matter
so
you're going to draw
okay
uh it's the same as mine
yeah
it's a it's a cat
what's this
it's a fat cat
it is not a fat cat
it's the fat cat okay
yeah it is a
can you draw uh um rabbit
oh hat ha rat
a rat
yeah
that's difficult
yes you have to draw a rat if you want a rat
no
a mouse is not too difficult
it's your rat
yeah it's okay
mouse is okay
yeah
just go you you the closest to the whiteboard
okay go
right but in grow it's everybody has to grow
mm
jus
okay
yeah
oh
okay i draw
the only thing i can draw is like this
oh
oh
oh
a duck
no
you love the eyes
what are you i don no idea so
what's this
yeah that was the eyes
okay
a clown
rabbit
it's a rabbit
pikachu
it's a rabbit
oh yeah
bugs bunny one
yeah
okay
it's not so bad so
the only thing i can draw because it's very simple
okay
i go
what
oh
so what else
this was my favourite one but
so you don't have a
thank you
a fish
right
a fish
that's a that's a fish
okay let's try to draw something
you forgot the chips
oh yeah doesn't look so fine
have to be really careful
fish and chips
okay it's your turn
ah it's my turn
oh
okay be careful
okay
so
it's ok so what can i draw some more
of
no problem no problem
oh
no
mm
yeah it's it's a se it's my priority this one
yeah
mm
a person
no
it's a really crazy dog
oh yeah
dog
okay
good
transfer
it's a dog in a village
okay
so what are you sug going to do now
i think it's done
yeah i think yeah
it's done
yeah
okay
just have to
so we have break
present project discuss a little bit about it
oh my god
oh we have twenty five minutes for the meeting
yeah
okay
so if you have questions
oh
hmm
know what time is it
no
no
it's okay
yeah it's okay
you know your job
you know your job
we have an idea yeah
you know your job
i have an idea of my job so yeah so
okay
yeah
okay
good
so i will open our functional design meeting
mm-hmm
so i will play role of the secretary
as also program ma manager
so we will have the three presentations from the
in industrial designer user interface designer and um
industrial design
marketing expert
what's your talk
okay
marketing experts
mm
and after that we uh will have the
uh
new product requirements
the decision on the remote control functions
and we will
close the meetings after
mm so
um i suppose the first to do the presentation will be the user interface designer
okay
um so you're participant two
one one
no no no
no you're
one
no i'm participant one
three three it's three sorry
i i think i'm a
okay never mind
okay
'kay did you save your presentation
in one
in one sorry
yeah
isn't that technical functions
no sure
so you didn't save it maybe
it's mine
uh it's david jordan
alright so
name's jordan
course
so
david jordan
mm yeah
mm-hmm
mm-hmm
so i'll
i let david jordan do his presentation
okay
no no
uh this one doesn't want to be moved i think
uh
too great for email then
okay so
the first i will present the technical function design for user interface for our uh remote t. v. control
yeah
uh i i will focus on user interface design
um so move to the next slide
mm
as we know our
remote c rem remote t. v. control it's very has very soph sophisticated functions as we show from this picture
there's a lot of functions
over i think over
s twelve or twenty s functions of a remote t. v. control
so how can we
um design a user interface with so sa with so many sophisticated functions
um let's move to next slide
um
yeah
so i so we want to design uh elegant easy to use inter interface
a very good example is google
as we know uh google it's a very successful because his um powerful function but with very easy to use user interface
um so move to next s slide
so my job is to uh design a google t. v. controller
which i want to have sophisticated functions while with very easy to use user interface
so
that's the end of the talk the end of the presentation
so you propose to to have the
uh
remote control which will be powerful
with sophisticated functions but with very yeah powerful
so powerful
many functions and very easy to use
yes
yep
so i dunno it's maybe difficult to have both i mean the the one on the right doesn't look so simple and
to merge the two system huh
yeah
yeah
you mean this one
yeah
yeah you have to learn the manual before using this remote control i suppose
mm yep
but but this is
but if we have very very good user interface
yeah
it take less time for user to learn how to use it
yeah and then
yeah
yeah you maybe you have some international standards where you know if you can use one is the other are or almost the same so the sign
oh you mean for the yeah pic pictograms or things like that
yeah yeah
for example i dunno here escape you know you have escape in computers you have
so if you see escape you know that it should be the same
oh it should okay yeah
so you have to the sh the user there for example the power off button it is something very international you know that
the user should know
so
yeah um such as maybe the
yeah
so
go on go back and
yeah but the question is how to merge you know the google system to the system alright
yeah that's gonna be the trick
yeah that's my job
that's your job
that's my job
it's not the easiest i've got to
it you
so you will propose us something which is
yeah so powerful and easy to use
yep
okay
okay
powerful and easy to use
so that's the point
yeah that's the point
so next i propose the industrial user interface to present things
okay okay
so you you're
participant two
yeah
um
okay
the rationale must be design or
so baba is the uh the industrial
designer
okay
so we can move to the next slide
as you all know you know m my job is to design you know uh
to give an industrial design of the remote control
so the re basically the remote control will be you know infrared control so the problem is how to relate the
mm-hmm
how to relate the remote control device like for example this one i h i'm holding in my hand and the t. v.
so this one is leather bu based but
mm
i propose a nifra infrared base you know
so so for me i think that it is better it's bet it's better to control t. v. so you know
so it's it will be cheaper and it is less technology than you know
for the cheap price we have for the cheap price we want to
true
so you mean that infrared control is a cheap technology
i think it's cheaper than laser so
yeah
okay
do y you know the requirements for the remote control
twelve nearly thirteen yeah
what the cost is
the cost
yeah i think for the cost we want for the cost we want it's better to have uh uh
twelve twelve a half
let's see
yeah
you can move to the next slide so
so the di the differen the findings you know what you find inside the re i the the system here inside it is just
you know a bulb and an infrared bulb so here for example the infrared bulb will be here and the bulb it will be somewhere inside
mm-hmm
that might just so
you can go to the next slide
okay
i have some kind of pictures
you know here
you have the b the bulb
it is a blue the blue stuff here and the infrared and the infrared bulb it is the red stuff you know and so and you have the other subcomponent that are not really here so important
yeah
so
what is this
this is in fact some other component that are in between the electrical de the electronic device
okay
look
but here what i wanted to emphasise it is just you know the bulb and
okay
so and the next slide it is the last one it's so it's
i think it should be wire wireless re remote con
because you know it's easier to manage and you know
because you f the b the the battery problem can hold you know will you use a battery or the a wire to connected you
or maybe some kind of thing that we can have both but you know i at my side prefer a wireless
okay
okay so if you have some question i didn't answer
okay
what's the average price of this technology then
well the avera the average prices i think that this technology will cost i dunno around eight euros so
or at least you know the
so what the wireless remote control
there's a wire with remote control
you'd yes you can
it's so so bres you have to decide how how you will you know put some energy inside
so you can think about wireless or you know it's it's a question that we can raise so
we can think that you know with the wire you know without a wire
we can have both also
okay
so you think that uh
a cable between the remote control and the t. v. won't be a good idea
okay
okay
no it wou maybe it will be cheaper i dunno i just may maybe you making a solu
but this is what you would like to ask the user first and i don't think the user would be ready to have a
yeah but
wireless remote control
yeah but some pa
i don't think well yeah i don't think he would but in a sense
i always want to have you know sometime i want to have wire because you know
yeah but as industrial designer do you think that it will be feasible to have uh linked or to have link between the remote control and the television
i'm just asking you
do you think it will be cheaper
uh i don't think it will be too much
could you answer please
okay
have to think about the question you know 'cause it's i think that you know you can always you know
okay
i think wha wha with the wire it's mm cheaper but you know the wireless it's more practical so
yeah but i think the wireless problem is more the um david jordan's problem
mm-hmm
as it's yeah
the wire
yeah
true
okay yeah
i think it's more your problem
mayb maybe you have just to to kind of research or try to ask people if they will like something wireless or not
mm-hmm
uh that's my job
okay i'm sorry
that's the
so
now the
yeah but it should be an agreement you know because even if you can think of the wireless
it is it's it is the job of the the the g graphical user designer but you know
if it is a lot cheaper and if you want to reach for example some
the the money you have if you want to use so it can be good to have a wireless it it is a question
okay
so just think of um the usability
right so
design a wireless remote control
yeah
just think of the problem
if when you have wireless remote control and if you lose it
yeah
yeah
i think it's would be easier to have a link between the remote control and the television yeah
well that's actually one of the point yeah
true
this you will see in my presentation then
so i will let you to do your presentation so
yeah
okay
which is participant four
so just trying to answer all the questions if the user would be happy to have something or something else uh
we've made a study so could you go to next slide
sorry for the functional recurrence
so that's the standard method for marketing okay
we had one hundred subjects um
we observe their remote control use in a lab and then after all the experiments they had to fill up a questionnaire um
and see what was okay or not for them
mm-hmm
okay
so then it's some statistics about what we observed and what they answered
um actually seventy five percent of the users find m the most remote controls uh ugly okay so that's
you mean the loo the look the outside
the look how it look like
okay
yeah the the look is is bad for them so uh it's your job david maybe
then eighty percent of users would spend more money um
actually if if the remote controls were not so ugly
so this is where we could have uh
yeah good market i guess if people are ready to pay more
yeah
so it's it's interesting information i think
and then um
yeah the remote controls like the one you've shown previously
it's not so doesn't fit the user requirements sometime because it's too many buttons and so on
so we should change this as well
and uh
users are actually zapping a lot so they're using the device intensively that's something to take into account as well
and um you know ten percent of the buttons are actually used in the remote control
and uh this is one of the main point for me
but i'll come back to it later
'kay
could you go next slide
uh so as you said uh remote controls are often lost somewhere in the room
mm-hmm
so this is from the experiments we've done so if we could solve this problem this would be interesting for the user i think
um it takes too much time to learn how to use the remote control for thirty five percent of the people
and uh remote control are really bad for r. s. i. problems for twenty six percent of the users
what is r. s. i.
r. s. i. is like when you're using the same um doing the same movement several times then you get injured
yeah
ah um okay
okay
so those numbers are less important then the previous one but still it has to be taken to count
so last slide
um so my pres personal preferences for this problem is we have to meet the user needs
if we can make it look fancy then we might sell more than our uh concurrent okay
okay
mm-hmm
and definitely if it could have less buttons still maybe the same number of um functions
functions
but less buttons this would definitely be a good way of selling more
okay
okay
so
mm okay
and just to have uh an idea do you think you as the
user interface designer to would it be possible to have less buttons and still have the same functionality and to have powerful remote control you think it's possible
yeah
sure
yeah i think possible
yeah
because we can
we can uh
mix uh several function in one button
yeah
so lets you then you have less buttons
yeah but do you think it will be easy to use
but i'm not sure
because if you have many functions just for one button it would be quite difficult for the user to know
yeah remember the user is not happy to read the
yeah i think the
the manuals
manual
it's
no you you can have a switch menu so you can
yeah but it has to be intuitive
well for example
yeah i think so
like for for example you can uh you can category the function i i into several classes
then
for um you can have a switch menu so you put the switch menu to it it tend to this kind of this category of functions
yeah okay
okay but
then you you put the switch button then it
switch to another category of functions
yeah
for example if you have remote control you you can rem you can control your t. v. and also you can control your uh recorder
with a
so there's a different functions but i if you you there's a button you can switch between control t. v. and control your recorder
so we can has less buttons
yeah but
but what i'm not so sure is about how to make the remote control look funny look fancy not funny
look fancy
this is a question that should be asked to the
because different people have a different opinion about fancy
you know
if you ask the people maybe the the marketing people
yeah
yeah this is something we sh
because maybe a colourful is fancy for some people but maybe simple and uh uniform colourful is fancy for some for other peoples so
mm-hmm
but this was first step and
this was the first step yeah
i think the solution is to have many colours of you know instead of having one grey standard
yeah but i think it will increase the price of the production of the remote control
specially distribution yeah
yeah yeah maybe
yeah maybe
if you need to have special colours for remote controls it will cost more
uh
yeah personalised colour
because you know
yeah it will cost little bit more
yeah because maybe some people prefer a red remote control some people prefer black remote control
yeah yeah yeah
yeah but this is what we would ask to the users so
and also f
maybe we can have di di we can have uh several options so user can select which colour they prefer so
yeah
yeah but as soon as you speak about options it means that the price increases
mm-hmm
yeah remember it's twelve euros
and we don't really want the price to be too too high because we wanna be able to produce it
so we want something fancy as uh previously said florent something very easy to use powerful and also as uh it's written here
seventy five percent of users they zap lot so maybe just having many functions in one button is not that good if you want to zap a lot
mm-hmm
hmm
and they don't really want to zap between functions of their remote control they want to zap between channels on t. v.
mm-hmm
so
i think you have quite lot of points to to think about and to discuss it with uh the other members
yeah
yeah hmm
yeah
so is it okay for your presentation
nothing else to to add
yeah it's done just yeah
if we would if we could remember like not too many buttons and make it look fancy i think it would make it
mm-hmm
okay
mm so
so i had some
so
new information about the product requirements so you will have to
take care of it of it in your thinking in your designing of the remote control
so the first one is that um for the designing of the remote control we don't really want to use the teletext anymore as it's something that's
mm-hmm
it's is uh
lame or
no yeah because now everybody has internet at home so it's better to use internet then teletext
mm-hmm
yeah
so you will have to think about it in your in in the design of your remote control
yep
and also the remote control will only be used for television so
for y for you your designing
you're not you won't be uh you won't had um buttons to just to manipulate yeah to control the recorder or maybe the garage door or things like that
control
mm-hmm
it's because if we want to
mm-hmm
to do remote control
mm
which will be used for for the television for the recorder for the camcorder and all the others
it will become too complex and it will increase the pli the price and we can't do that
we really want to focus on the remote control for the television
is it okay
okay
but there's balance between function and the cost
so maybe it will be easier for you to to design it to have very powerful and easy
yeah
okay
and also we want the image of the uh um real reaction be recognisable in the product such as the colour and s the slogan
mm-hmm
yeah
i mean that's uh if uh you want to buy a remote control and if you go in a shop and if you see the remote control you will recognise directly that s it's our product
mm hm
mm-hmm
so you will have to use the colour of the product of the um um
okay
of the uh of real reaction
okay
so
and uh also
so has to be yellow
yeah
yellow
as we say we put the fashion in electronics so it has to be a fashion remote control
okay
fancy fashion powerful easy to use
mm-hmm
require lot of requirements but
yeah
for cheap remote control yeah
and cheap
yeah
a low cost
yeah
but uh that's your your job to find something mm matches
yeah
yeah 'cause what i'm thinking is how will you will connect the t. v. to internet so
this is
i don't think it's part of the remote control design anyway
maybe not but mayb
it's maybe more in browsing
yeah but this this mean that your t. v. would be able to you know connect to internet you know surf the web
yeah there's that box in uh o of it
yeah
a pi there's that box in the t. v. so with the set box you you can connect internet with your t. v.
okay
ok
hm mm
it's it's not so uh popular now
it's pop i don't think it's popular so that's the problem so
mm
you had i if you are designing a remote control for you know
the global usage so if people don't have the technology
global okay
so
mm-hmm
so everybody is okay with the new requirements
so i i so
as as for the colour what what do you think
i think it has to be yellow
yellow
yeah
do you think that people like the colour yellow
yellow
t. v. remote control
min
maybe you can change the colour but the image of the society has to be recognised
okay
okay
yeah
i think if you have you know th like a yellow ribbon here is the double r.
why you go
it has to be fashion
or should be
yeah so
doesn't need to be completely yellow but just mm
okay
so you have to
yeah
it has to be a fashion and really be uh the image of the society
just when you enter you say oh oh it's real reaction
think it's a re reaction remote control so
okay okay
okay
and also it has to be attractive of course because if you want to sale to sell the remote control
mm
it's okay
regarding the first line what
so we're just expecting no more use of the teletext
yeah
and that's it
yeah
but i dunno but why nobody's a threat to me
it's already changed for
i think it would be simpler
mm-hmm
okay
so
i will close the meeting um just after that we'll have lunch break
and you will have in thirty minutes individual work
uh
y you
you will have as the i. d. i don't remember what is industr industrial designer to put um pon yeah
industrial designer yeah
industrial designer
component component yeah
and the user interface designer to work on the user interface concept
okay
and florent to
work my subject
yep
and so specific instructions will be sent to you by your personal coach
okay
it's okay
yeah
i think the um session is closed
good
and by the way mister david jordan please record your presentations in your own folder
okay okay that's clear
okay
not in mine
okay
should be better
so let's start our second me meeting on conceptual design
mm-hmm
so
as the previous meeting i will be the secretary and we will have three presentations and we'll have to decide on the remote control concept and finally we'll close the decision
mm-hmm
so i will first uh
no y you do the minutes first or
what
no
i i think i will let uh our user interface designer speak first mister david jordan
okay
yep
so we'll
yeah
s technical accessoire
no no no
interface
yeah
this
mm
so uh first i will present the concept of user interface
um there's three concepts in the user interface
so first one it's a google controller
the second is a fancy controller
the last one is uh intelligent controller
so there are three concepts in our controller
um n next i will explain one by one the first is google controller
um so i want the controller to be easy to use but with sophisticated functions
so it's a combination of easy to use and um sophisticated functions
uh this is a first concept of our controller
the second concept is a fancy controller um so we want give the customers the impression that our controller is very attractive
um they can easy recognise our controller among a lot of products
so so the u the user f the the u user interface should be very very cute very very g um
mm
mm
a nice one
attractive
such like this there are several uh examples in the slides
i'm not sure the one in the middle is very attractive
yeah it's very you know if you're
it's very big yeah
yeah
it's hard f i it's easy for you to remember it
or to recognise it yeah
okay
yeah why not
yeah
yeah
we'll have big discussion i suppose after that so
yeah
yeah
yeah
mm
so the last uh concept is intelligent
we want uh we want our controller to be smart so maybe we should uh use um uh
mm-hmm
mm
technology such as speech recognition technology and gesture recognition technology
so we need to have coop some cooperation with some research institute on speech recognition and um gesture recognition
um
with this advanced features we i think we can attract a lot of user
okay
okay
something else
no
there this is the three concepts of our controller
yeah
i just have one question because for the intelligent controller you said that we can use the voice recognition or the gesture recognition
yeah
yeah
but as the um expert told us most of the people want to use the remote control to zap t to zap between channels
yeah so
do you think they will be able to use gestures
because if they do all the time the same gesture as you said previously in the last meeting maybe they will get injuries because of that
y
yeah
or if you say channel three channel three two three four six five i think they will be bored after a while
maybe
you don't think so
uh i think some time it's very uh convenient to use voice interface and gesture interface than use button
yeah sure
for example if you cannot find your uh controller you can just uh just just uh speak something such as yeah one two
i that's true
oh yeah that's a good that's a good point so
one and
yeah but suppose you got a cold
you have a mute remote controller
yeah
mm
so you can use your gesture
that's no problem
yeah but how how is how risky is it to trust like speech recognition or gesture recognition
broken arm
for limited vocabulary speech recognition is very reliable and for s limited vocabulary gesture recognition is also very
okay
okay
yeah but suppose you have a family watching t. v.
yeah
and if they want to use their private remote control in the same time do you think it will work
yep
everybody wanting to change channel in the same time
but this this but this would never happen anyway
yeah they cannot speak at the same time
why
yeah
if you have one brother and one sister and they want to watch their favourite uh t. v. programme
yeah but the
so they say oh channel four channel three channel four channel three all the time so
yeah but yeah but the same can happen even with it you know this kind of remote control because the
yeah it's very interesting
yeah but this
yeah
yeah
i don't think it
yeah but you have the remote control so maybe you can keep it f with you
that's right
you're not you're not obliged to share it
oh okay okay you mean it could be a problem for this kind of stuff
yeah we can yeah
yeah that's that's the advantage of intelligent controller
even you h you have the controller i can i can say channel three so it's c come to channel three i don't have to
no
it's it's
no but this is disadvant disadvantage
yeah i think it's a disadvantage
it's advantage
yeah
and mayb maybe we can have the switching mode to pass from you know voice controller to
yeah but one other question
manual controllers eh
how how much will it cost
no more expensive maybe
how much
yeah
because i suppose we need to do research to have something working
no no we we d we we just are use um
uh if you if if you use the basic
some some efficient
no no we just um have some cooperation with some research institute we don't have to do some basic research on this field
so you think it won't cost an
not a lot for us
or
yeah i think it's uh because uh this technology is uh
um for limited wor or limited wor uh lexical recognition it's very
yeah but uh uh
it's uh yeah
but it's it's changing how the remote control is gonna be built
it's
because then you need uh
i mean this doesn't have uh the power to do recognition for example
well y y you have also the language problem you know when you
no it's uh
even for the f um because the the vocabulary the
mm mm
'cause it it have to be universal so
yeah
i agree with uh
the vocabulary is very small so that's not a problem
yeah
yeah but there is one problem that uh baba talked about is the international
yeah
yeah
remote control
we need something that is international
suppose we're we want to sell it in france
yeah
the recognition system will be able to understand french
if you want to go to england it will be able to understand english so
yeah
yeah the key the key um the key of our the key feature of our controller is that it's it has some some um adaptation
yeah this could be downloaded by the web maybe or
yeah but you know
mechanism
the product the pro
it's it's it means when you when you sell this controller in china it's can recognise chinese
it's r if you sell this controller in france it can recognise french
it's a very smart it's a very smart controller maybe
yeah
mm okay
yeah it's
and with no increase in the pri production price of the remote control
oh yeah yeah yeah yeah
because of this product uh this technology has already been developed
but
yeah but how will you
so
yeah but the problem is how to s you know if this is a push button controller
you can send this con this remote control everywhere in the world the same one
yeah
yeah
mm
if you have the language you have to develop for each country
oh n yeah yeah tha that's why we have to do language adaptation
yeah but for each country you have to do one because uh the for example for se
yeah
even for each f for even for different family we have to do d yeah we would we have to do adaptation to
oh really
that's
oh
yeah but then w
seems to be quite complex
yeah we have to take care of the twelve euros
comple
no it's not so complex
problem
and what about voice recognition do we have microphones
and where will be they
do you think if we're far from television it will work
no no no it's not
i think that's n that's not a problem because you you don't have to wear a microphone
it it just the microphone is embedded in the controller
yeah but where is the controller
okay
where is the controller
yeah
it's in your family in your home
no but then it's it's like this uh
yeah but we're here it's uh an object
but here you say you want to use i uh s technology
yeah
yeah you can you can embed it uh microphone here
a microphone maybe
yeah but wha what is the use of voice or gesture recognition if you have a remote control li like this if you have an object
if you want to use voice or gesture you need to be free without any object
to talk to the to the t. v. maybe
you just want to interact with television
yeah yeah just you just put the controller here then you
i if you say one he switch to channel yeah
you use your command and you do s your gesture
yeah but you can lose it
no no it's n y if you lose it
so well for example if it is somewhere in the room if i maybe if it is in the table there you can always say s channel one and the t the remote control gives the order to the t. v. to switch to channel one
yeah
okay you so you can build a kind of black box and put it on t. v. and just to recognize gestures and voice
devic
yeah
yeah
yeah
yeah but so you need a camera and you know a microphone inside your remote control
yeah
ah
but you would still have the buttons
or is it do you think it should be only voice recognition and gesture recognition
or you you still have the possibility to use buttons
i think it we should give the uh flexibility to the user and we think yeah
okay so you yeah
yeah but
you can see they can switch form one modality to another
mm
yeah i dunno
it's a bit risky risky
yeah
i think so
no that's quite inter quite attractive
and maybe it will be quite
but i think that you know switching from one country to to another will be a problem so although y y
well if you do language adaptation there should be no problem
yeah i dunno
yeah but i i
okay
we should have confidence in technology
yeah we should
uh
hmm
so what do you think
we'll try the controllers you'd prefer
mm
what
which kind of controller would you prefer to use you as a remote control user
if if
i mean uh i'm sure if the user pays the same price he's happy to have recognition
more features yeah
but if if if it like doubles uh
yeah but
i think he need a control that is very reliable so
no one would would be interested
so i think it would be better not to do any intelligent controller and to stay with the google controller or a fancy controller
maybe try to mix the google controller and the fancy controller
hmm
yeah
yeah
just want to have something controller which is in a kind of intelligent controller easy to use sophisticated and fancy
yeah but if if you stick to um
you think it's possible
stick to the first two parts
so what's the difference between our controller with other products in the market
there's no k features of our controller so is there is there any necessary to design new controller without any breakthrough features
yeah
yeah
no i mean
would y would you replace your controller with a controller with similar function if you do not have some some function inside it that
it's not really the we we can add for example some function like for browsing in internet so or something like that
y
but uh i think a user need
yeah you y that's a fun that's not the function of the controller that's a function of t. v.
you can replace your t. v. with a new t. v. with internet browsing function but
no but you need you need new remote controller then
because if you wanna browse internet or i don't know if you wanna type something or
don't have a the the
okay
yeah if we can send email from it
but it's not the only the problem only the issue of controller it's it's also the issue of the t. v.
no
no
because the p the problem i can see with with the voice or the gesture itself wh what can happen in a family i i for example if
cause for example yeah
yeah but we do we do we we we cannot rely one hundred percent on these features to u to use the controller
yeah
yeah but uh we want so
but with the features of our controller such as you have the feature of voice recognition in your mobile but you seldom use it
your mobile but you when you choose a new mobile you choose the one with voice recognition
yeah you wou you would
true
that's the feature is not one hundred percent reliable but it's a feature to distinguish our product from our from other products
yeah but w we we want something th that works all the time every day every hour for everyone
yeah
yeah
yeah uh
and for all the person of the family maybe so yeah
yeah if if if if you're if you ar if you already have a product it works one hundred percent reliable would you replace it with another one
you don't need to tune it
yeah why not
i mean for example the goo y you say we would we would to have a google like controller
if it's
because you have new
yeah
yeah
i don't see how adding speech or gesture recognition would make the remote control look more like google
google is is simple works fine
yeah
so i i guess if can have a remote control that is really basic simple and works fine it's already a lot
yeah
oh yes but there's no big difference between the traditional controller
uh thi this
i mean the user is not only interested in having speech or gesture recognition or if he has something that works fine and is really fancy
the then nn no
tha
looks nice and it's easy easy to use easy to use
not too expensive too
but the there's there's n there's n not enough motivation for them to replace their old controller with a new one if there's no key feature in the new controller
see
that's the problem yeah
that's the same yeah
i mean i i know it's more interesting to develop a remote controller with speech and gesture and whatever
yeah
ye
but you have to think the user is the one who gonna buy the product and so
yeah
okay
i mean that's the point
so let's go to the industrial designer
okay
okay
maybe we'll be able to take a decision after that so
okay
yeah
two
yeah participant two um
working
yeah working design so
so
i think
i can
can you go to the next one
i uh it's not this one
it's uh oth the oth so i it's the working design
okay
sorry
component design
it's okay
so this yeah so this is the described use what
are you inst
uh i think there's something wrong with your
it did didn't r receive it
didn't receive it
maybe you you record it somewhere else
i don't think so
participant one
participant one
interface concept
no
hmm
mm mm
oh
maybe i record recorded directly on the
computer
yeah
uh
dunno
nope
okay okay
yes
it seems that we have a problem with the
i dunno if you remember what you had to say or
i can say it to you without
yeah so
yeah maybe we can first come to
no i think it will be more interesting to start with uh
uh to frahan
with frahan then you can prepare your slides then present it later
i think it's more interesting what he says okay
yeah
yeah exac
you will had s some more information in i think it will be interesting after your presentation to have um baba's presentation
okay
yeah
yeah true
yeah
okay
in fact i don't know
so
i s because i in my presentation i don't have here with so it was in fact the design use to show you the design of what is inside a what is inside and what are the different component of the r
okay
okay never mind
okay
of the remote control
okay
so it will be interesting so i could show you some some picture of what is inside and so
okay
so i in fact the the f something i want to discuss is which kind of material are we going to use
so will it will be wooden wooden di wooden remote control or a a plastic remote control like this one
mm-hmm
so and in which which which kind will be the the different bu button so it can be some you know
mm-hmm
classic pushbutton like this one or you have also some button like l. c. d. where you know
mm-hmm
mm-hmm
the button the buttons are unlighted during the night or you know you can see them in the darkness
okay
okay
and
the other thing i want to discuss also is which kind of alimentation electric alimentation do you want to have
so will it be for example uh d uh solar energy alimentation or will it be a battery like the classical battery so
uh-huh
and i think that for example for the alimentation it would be good to have
uh both of them so so for example in some country where you are in the the countryside and you are far from you know
the cities uh for example in some place in in s senegal so if you have electric if you have solar alimentation
mm-hmm
mm-hmm
you just
when you want to have recharger or remote control power you just put it on the sun and after one hour you can come and so it can be interesting for people to have this kind of remote con it can be something interesting to make people buy it
for example
yeah
i think it's an added value to the remote control and maybe it can attract all the ecological k yeah consumers and but about the the price of adding this solar battery
yeah
yeah yeah mm
ecologists yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
yeah
yeah
would it be something really that will increase the price of production more no
alrigh
in fact having them both will if we want to have battery
regular battery and and the solar energy battery it could be it'll it will add a little bit of the price
so
but it will be an added value also that will be compensated so hmm
yeah
okay
and what tha what about the uh
materials
and the materials it depends for example you if you have a wooden material it can be more the plastic material is more common it's very resistant but
impersonal mm-hmm
you know something wooden will be like i don't know high cl so a special high class or you know you can have some
yeah
special for
mm-hmm
yeah and i if you we want to put fashion in electronics maybe we can try to do something with wood
mm-hmm
yeah even if it is not completely wood but just a part of the
yeah
you know will be wooden in wood and it can be interesting
mm-hmm
mm
mm okay seems to be interesting mm
and so the last point is y also would do you want to have some very cheap
integrated cir circuits chips or do you have low level or or very very expensive
it depends but i think that low level will be you know it is an interim module
yeah we want something easy to use and so i think maybe something very low level wou would be enough
yeah
yeah
yeah yeah
and you think that we will be
yeah i think it will fit on the price we want twel twelve euros so
okay
so wood
and what about the buttons
i think the buttons i pr i prefer you know
the l. c. d. you know lighted buttons because you know it's i don't know um yeah in the dark
no it's fashion yeah
it's fashion and it's related to how beautiful it is or uh if you want to watch t. v. in the darkness or if you want to lo find your find your your remote control that is lost
you know in the darkness it's very easy so right
what about the touch scr touch screen
for example
it's it's expensive i i guess
i think a touch screen
will be t as expensive as the l. c. d. buttons so
mm
but and it is a kind of other design i mean
it can also be interesting to have this kind of
yeah
so you got email
i dunno
i think we have only uh five minutes left
okay
participant four
functional requirements
uh no trend watching
the other one
this one
yeah
uh i think so just
yeah so just to meet the user requirements i would just do a s short anal analysis of the remote control market and to kind of um
have a better overview of what's the fashion in general i've checked more than only the remote control market so next
so again it's pretty much similar to what i've said in the previous meeting
um user really really want a fancy look and feel
they're not so so interested in uh functional look and feel okay
like the one you've shown david with all the buttons and i mean i i it sounds good technically but it's it's not what they want and uh
mm
mm
so second point is they still want it it to be technologically innovative
so maybe it's sort of related to what you've said with the speech recognition and so on
okay
at the same time it's important that it's easy to use
so that were the three first points from the remote control uh analysis
now i if we look at fashion in general um
okay
wha what we really see this year is that uh everything from clothes to shoes and furniture is is inspired by fruits and vegetables
okay so i think we really have to take this into account for the design of the the thing
ah yes
yeah yeah
okay yeah
'cause it's it's really what people want
even if it's in general fashion we want it to be in the remote control
and then uh if if we take the ordering or the ranking of all the points
fancy look and feel has on a score of seven would have six as importance
uh the remote control has to be technologically innovative it's three
then easy to use uh it's not so important actually with respect to other y other ones
okay
so we see fancy look an look and feel is the most important one and then if we combine this with the fashion uh from milan and paris
and fruit and vegetables yeah
we go to the fruits and vede vegetables
and the other point i haven't mention is people wan want to have a spongy touch okay so this is this maybe doesn't really fit with the wooden design
spongy 'kay
okay yeah yeah
i dunno
yeah but the problem is which kind of material do you need to to be spongy
yeah thi this is this would be like um
pla
plastic like but rubber mayb maybe you know rubber like uh
s
very stuff okay rubber rubber desi okay yeah
yeah
device so um
yeah
okay tha tha that was the main point i think from the trend
in fashion
okay
so we have to take decisions about the component concepts about the energy
so as you say you want something technologically innovative maybe using solar energy and with battery would be something interesting maybe will attract
yeah
solar
yeah so when i think it's
okay
mm-hmm
yeah
it will be a
pro ecology consumers
yeah
uh cheap imprint so you s you propose low level chips would be uh enough to have something working well
yeah i think
yeah yeah
yeah
case
later
so you think case
something spongy
someth no wood
no wood but plastic
maybe not no wood but i mean ma maybe not the part you touching you know
would some
pla
maybe you
i think we can have wood for example in the bottom and you know
yeah maybe the base
it depends on the design we want so
it's it's natural
but still y
yeah it's natural and i
yeah
th the feeling is natural so maybe we can stay with wood
and it can be correlated to energy solar energy so for the marketing aspect you know saying that it's ecol
yeah i mean it's not exactly right for the spongy point of view
mm yeah it's not right so
but it's still fashion
but we could maybe have both like part of wood and some rubber for the buttons or i dunno
okay
yeah something that you can into it
yeah
uh and what about the user interface concept
google and
google and fancy
and fancy f how about the the voice
and
because i think that with the voice and gesture recognition there are still some
disadvantages with this
uh yes
uh maybe we can do some marketing studies asking people if they're interested and how
it it is an an interesting concept to see to have uh voice control
yeah
yeah
yeah
the smart controller
mm
yeah
but and the problem is i i'm we can infer i if you have v voice control why not to put it directly on the the t. v.
so speak directly to the t. v. and you don't need a remote control actually so
yeah but you need a receiver to recognize the gestures and the voice
but it will be embedded on the t. v. and not on the remote control so
that's true
yeah d
okay
i dunno
so maybe we'll just focus on the google controller plus the fancy controller maybe try to mix them these two concepts together
mm
just in one and do a remote control with solar energy and batteries and with lev low level chips and wood
yeah
it's good
and l. c. d. buttons
yeah l. c. d.
yeah i think for these supplements the solar energy would be something quite interesting and not maybe too difficult to add
yeah yeah yeah
and pf what can we think a supplement to
what interface
yeah for the interface something added value
i think the supplement can be the voice
it is just you know it is not the most important but
it can be a part of
with a module
you mean the remote control with a mur module if you want you can just use
yeah yeah
commands words and use them when you don't want to use your fingers
yeah
mm
mm-hmm
to push button yeah yeah
even it is for s just some kids you know switching channels one two three four
turning the t. v. o on o or off
yeah turning yeah yeah
not very complex commands but easy commands so
so adding some vocal commands
yeah
simple ones
yeah simple ones for
okay
so the next meeting will start in thirty meeti minutes so we'll you will all have to work in
in your direction
so you will have to work on the look and feel design to have the easy to use
yeah
powerful and fancy remote control with some added value such as the uh simple vocal commands recognition
yep
yeah
uh you will have to work more baba
on the um spongy way to to add spongy um touch to the buttons and try to find maybe a nice shape for the wooden remote control
expensive buttons yeah to make some new
yeah
and i sup i think we'll have to evaluate th the product too
yeah no not forgetting about the fruits and vegetables trends
yeah
okay fruits
yeah
if possible
okay
and remember as as i said last meeting
we really have to build a fashion remote control and uh the colour of the um the society will be really it will be seen in the remote control
need it to be okay
so you will have baba and david jordan you will have to work together on the prototype and you will have next time to show us um modelling a cl a clay remote control
yeah
okay
so you will have to model model something
okay
yep
and i think that some specific instructions will be sent to you by your personal coach
okay
so no more questions we can close the session
okay
hmm
sounds good mm-hmm
okay
yeah
okay
okay cool
mm-hmm
so ready
no not really
'kay
just
crap
sorry i i um i'm afraid
okay
it's perfect
your judgement it's is biased
uh thi this remote control will stay a prototype
'kay so whe where is the remote control
so we are so
where
it's here
okay
let's go for our detailed design meeting
yep
so i will still play the role of the secretary and we'll have um first the project presentation by our user interface designer
okay
david jordan and our industrial designer baba
yeah
yeah
yeah
so we'll have to evaluate the uh your proposed remote control and um have an idea of the price that uh this thing will cost
'kay
and in case if we're we all agree on the fabrica of um building of this remote control we'll evaluate the um production
so maybe i will let the our two designers talk about so their you have s oh sorry
i have slides
okay
oops
ah that is three
effectively one slide and maybe we can discuss everything
product prod
what slides
yep
okay
okay
so this is our product or prototype
this is made by clay
looks strange
yeah
uh the basic colour is uh yellow and red
yellow is uh our company colour uh red it's uh is more attractive
okay
so we used two basic colour yellow and red
and the shape there's two basic shape
the first is a circle and the second is a triangle s piece
it's we call it a mushroom design
okay
it's looks like some mushroom so we call it mushroom design
yeah
uh
so this is a introduction of our product
genetically modified mushroom i will say but keep on speaking
next a mo
okay yeah so next slide
yeah
so there are several key features of our pr prototype
the first is that it is fuzzy
i'm sure this would be the unique design the market
oh
yeah yeah i'm sure
maybe i hope so
yeah so it's a fuzzy design and a unique design
yeah that's true
um and uh
the second key feature is that uh s circle channel um selection
in the traditional key uh traditional controller use button to to select the channel but now we have a s circle
so we can turn this ball to t to select channel
so it's quite convenient for user to use it
chan
yeah okay but don't touch don't destroy your prototype
yeah s okay
uh the third feature is a stable triangle base
uh this sta uh this triangle base is very stable so
uh so it's it's um it's unlikely you cannot found it
so it's v um you can put it in the table so you can turn the the ball to cha to select the channel
and there's some cute button
you c can can you can see the the shape of the buttons n is a mushroom so
everything's mushroom
yeah
yeah everything's mushroom
so we can call our remote control the mushroom
mush
yeah but it's not like really mushroom because you have uh you know uh like lemon shape you know centre is yellow and t d
mushroom design yeah
yeah
okay
yeah th that's why if you put it in the table be careful somebody will eat it
to integrate you know yeah
i don't think i hope nobody will eat it
you know to integrate the fruit aspect you know the the in
yeah
oh
yeah because mushroom was not in the trends
i mean there was fruits yeah
really
fruits and vegetables
but
fruit and vegetable so mushroom was a kind of you know uh
vegetables
yeah
mushroom is a vegetable
yeah
i don't think it is
it's vegetable
mushroom
yeah
mm-hmm
oh uh i'm not sure
so th it's something eatable
we can it's a veg a kind of vegetable but you know we we integrated them with different colour
yeah
yeah
but anyway this is not a mushroom anyway so it's fine
yeah
i i think we take into account what you said about fruit and vegetable you know
this you know very enlighted colours you know
no i mean yeah yeah
inspira inspiration is
and inspired colour and and very sophisticated material so
true
yeah
and so
next slide
uh no this our only two slides
so what we w what i can add is that you know he talk about what is outside
yeah
so what is inside is what we dis what we talked before about you know the chip it is a low level chip and
so we cut it to see
you know we don't need to k
mm-hmm
you know wi the low level chips inside and you know the l. c. d. button and the i
okay
so where's the battery battery
the battery it is under
it is in th in in the base yeah
in the base
base
in the basement
here
in the basement
and where is the solar solar cell
but we say uh we sa we said solar
where is the solar cell
in fact this this this this is a kind of you know revolutionary solar receptor that we can put outside and i don't think so
oh
do you think it won't be it won't cris increase the price
okay
okay we'll see after
but it it's might be okay so
we will have first to so mister money what's your opinion according to this remote control
i it might be okay
okay
so
yeah
i mean we gonna try to measure how
good it is instead of just talking about uh we had three keys key points to uh for this remote control design and first one was uh
mm-hmm
fancy
look and feel
yeah
yeah
so w we'll try to judge this feature uh with a one to seven scale one being uh no i think
uh just let me check
so four point three point five it means it's acceptable
one one being true and seven being false
okay
oops
ouch
so
okay
do we have a fancy look and feel according to you
yeah i think so
i think you have nice colours
i don't the sha the bowl shape people like
but is it
yeah the shape is unique and the colour
uh i'll agree it's unique but is it really
is it really fancy
so it depend on how d do you define fancy
yeah i mean fancy was was defined by s fruit and vegetable look
but it's you have the lemon aspect of this th this this thing
yeah
maybe if you change if you take the buttons out and maybe do things like that
do don't do that please
i dunno where the lemon is but i mean it's not obvious
i it's it's i this shape is a lemon like so
it would be bet more like a lemon
yeah
if
because i
i dunno maybe improving the texture of like having it less smooth or
yeah
less button
uh
so my mush
looks like more fruit
yeah but you don't have any button now
mm
maybe a pineapple
yeah
i dunno
and you know you have the
finger here with the buttons
yeah
hmm
that's uh yeah is that that's a good idea
yeah it's getting
so that's great
it looks more like a pineapple
that's great
sorry
what's the use for that
uh for turn turn the ball
i have no idea so
if you want to turn the ball it's very it's very convenient for you to to to turn the ball to change the channel
i have no idea what
and where is the voice recognition
okay
uh
ah it's embedded your microphone
yeah that's
okay
th this th th there's two two functions
wait th that's the second point
this is microphone array
first one is we have to judge the fancy look and feel
if it is fancy or not
okay
is it better like that
i mean
so we can we can say t
looks okay let's say it's a pineapple now
the colour is the colour acceptable
no the colour is okay that's fine
so the shape now
i mean it's but i would say there is more too much red
it looks like a now you took it
it's too much red
um if
in the basement
it looks like a pineapple with cherry on top
okay
right
i will give i will
so from one to seven
mm uh
seven is the ma the maximum
no seven is false and one is true
i'll gi
i'll give two or three
three it's okay
three i will say three
three three
three
three is fine for me
okay
'kay
three
isn't it bitter like that
yeah yeah yeah
then uh let me
what other
the other criterion is is it technologically uh technologically in innovative
is it easy to use
feasible
ye uh
you said previously that you there's um microphone inside an
embedded
yeah this is microphone array in fact
it's a micro array okay
there four microphone
oh
okay and you have the there's the technology inside that recognise simple vocal comments
so they they they they there's a microphone array
yeah yeah
so you can capture voice yeah you c
and you can turn it so maybe it's techno technologically innov innovative
oh yeah yeah
yeah so you can capture s voice from different directions
and i think you you've never seen a rou a round remote control so it is
yeah bu but when you say technologically it's more uh i dunno in the core or single
yeah
i
w yeah but
we have tactile buttons
mm-hmm
i see you have microphone array embedded
you have that's good
no that's good
yeah
and you have you know this ki this solar receptor that you know yes
oh yeah
yeah th that's another really good point
yeah
maybe okay
i think technically it's acceptable so
maybe two
yeah
so using the same scale two
two
two yeah two
i would say two
it's it's fine so
you agree
okay
yeah i agree
it's better like that isn't it
now maybe the most critical one
most
okay
l last one w i would like to judge is
is it easy to use
eh for th the vocal command yes it's might be easy
but it's just speaking
yeah it's very easy
you just need the command
yeah but this this turning can you can you just re explain me the
you can use this in this way
as a principle
please
yeah
th this is the base
yeah
so you can turn to change the channel
yeah but how how intuitive is it to turn things to change channels
you just tu turn d d
i think maybe if you he
like if you want to go from
oh ok i understand
if you hear some click
you take take the remote so and you can turn like that to change the channel
yeah
yeah
yeah but imagine you y
i think it's quite easy to so s zapping but maybe it will be too fast
yeah it would
yeah i'm i'm no i'm not definitely convinced it's it's the best way to if you wanna jump from i dunno one to twenty
oh yeah that's difficult
yeah
how can you go directly to twenty for example
that's dif that's difficult
no no no
i if y uh if it depend on the the angle you turn the
yeah
yeah
yeah but y how you need to know i
i agree
i agree
but i mean if you're fro from two
i if if this is a channel one
so it c it could be channel two channel three channel four channel five
i think something that yeah
yeah you have a like that and so on
so change
yeah
and you you can
yeah ju just imagine you have fifty fifty channels uh
oh yeah
y uh fifth channel divided by the num by the by three hundred thirteen degree
we're not talking
yeah
so you got how many degree you you it
yeah but y but you have to go through all the channels if you want to go
i think you can if you have a scale so
no no you don't have to y no it's uh when you when you stop t uh when you stop the
the turn
mm-hmm
then the angle you stop is the angle you is the channel you
yeah
how d how do you know this angle is th is the correct one
it's it's very easy because you kn you know how many channel are there in the
so you you count one degree two degrees no
yeah yeah yeah
you can do it
i don't think so
yeah it's a bit difficult
i think so i think so you can do it
i think so you can just change
i think b but the the vocal command is easy too
you can say fifty and fifty it's okay so
yeah voc vocal command is okay
but w we've said previously that maybe it's not going to be th l the main
there's uh also a number you know
yeah but when you're zapping you're changing from one channel to the other so you're passing through all the channels
so when you say i want to go to the channel number twenty that's you've decided to go to channel twenty
so you can say channel twenty or channel four because you really want to go on this channel
uh yeah and y that's yeah
but if you really want to to do zapping you you don't really know what you want to do you can turn it
and this would be more for browsing ah
yeah
yeah
just go through all the channels and maybe stop if there is something interesting
to see uh yeah uh
mm-hmm
yeah
yeah
yeah
mm-hmm
seems to be good
yeah
good choice mister david jordan
yeah
yeah i mean you're famous
and but i'd
and also you can if you i
you
yeah what's what's this cherry
you ca you can turn this
or you ca you can you can also turn this
it is a turn off t turn off button maybe
for this you can tune it's for tune
you you if you want to skip from channel one to channel two you you skip this
if you want to from uh skip from channel one to channel ten you tune this
mm
it's like fine from coarse to fine
this is coarse this is fine
yeah yeah yeah
that's
okay
so it's coarse to fine design
that's very technologic so
yeah
yeah
okay the uh th this looks better
yeah
yeah is is this is from one channel to maybe to ten channel
s but i di i didn't see where the t f the turn off t turn on turn off button so much activates maybe one of the
this is from one channel to
yeah th you have the vocal commands
yeah
yeah
uh it's k on off yeah
yeah
on off
yeah but it has to be on to recognise fas
most of the time you have the yeah it's a sleeping remote control
yeah sleeping
ah that's not the ecological part yeah
that's true
w that why we have the solar ti yeah
solar
to compensate
yeah
okay
so three
so which number
easy to use it's very relative but three it's fine i think it's reasonable three
mm-hmm
do you agree
yeah agree agree
three
so reasonably is four is one
three f three for me it's o it's okay
so three
four or three
maybe you can vote to see how many everybody gives and no and just take the mean
and what's your opinion
uh we wouldn't say i mean those are sort of agreed but this one would be more five to me
will you give
four
five
i'd like i mean this is the just a prototype
i'm not really convinced it's so easy to use but i don't know
yeah so maybe if
uh w w what do y what uh you compare with traditional uh um tr traditional controller
yeah
i think it's easier than traditional controller
if you use traditional controller you have to put a button but now you don't have to put button you have you just turn the turn the ball
yeah but y you know
there's two kind of balls the smaller the the the so you can c you can c you can control the scale
so you have yeah
but in the traditional controller how do how can you control the scale
uh by pushing zero after after the first one
you just push two button zero and and one
yeah yeah yeah y you you can do it
and that's
yeah
but you can also do it in the b if you you do not wa if you do not want to browsing all the channel you can just p there's also a button here
are there some buttons
okay
yeah this function is just for your browsing from one channel to th the next one the next s sn s the th the third one
mm-hmm
it's not what you said previously
previously you said that turning this was the fine
yeah if you're changing your mind
fine to coarse
fine to coarse
yeah yeah
and from ten to ten channels here
y one to ten ten to twelve uh ten to t uh twenty
ten to twenty and this one t one two three four five six like this
okay
uh there's different scale so you can you can choose how much do you want to sc
okay
but this this has to stay on the table right
mm-hmm
this has to stay on the table
in fact on a flat place
i i this is just a base
you can just
you can
yeah but then uh when you turn turn it
yeah
oh
oh ye yes that's right
yeah no no no
just
you can't put it out
it's
it's just your turning from the base
you need to have everything in hand
if you want to turn you can't use it and turn
oh my god
it's impossible
yeah
you need to put it on and turn
you know tha that's the weak point because with a traditional one you just have one hand
you use your y
yeah but nobody would be able to take it in the pocket and bring it in the kitchen and say i've lost the remote control
so th this is a d next generation controller
nobody would take it
sure
yeah you would never you would never lose this one yeah
so nobody w will lost lose it
yeah maybe maybe may it's the next prototype maybe we cou
yeah
yeah
okay okay okay
s maybe we can change from th
four
maybe four it's okay
four
okay
four
i'll put four
easy to use four
gonna say four
four
yeah four it's more reasonable
uh it's even easier to maybe
you can you can erase with this er yeah
ok
okay
mm
yeah four it's more reasonable so
so it's nine nine over three
so average
three
three
trois
oh yeah it's
three
trois
okay so
it need maybe some wo further work but it's
yeah especially on the easy to use
yeah uh s yeah
yeah
target
might it might be fine
so th the project is accepted
okay
yeah
yeah b i think
but i d m i think that it will be good to do some more work to transform this into a pineapple
yeah
yeah yeah
yeah
if you re we really want to have a fruitful remote control
okay
so uh mm mm
that's the finance
mm
okay and we we had a project prototype presentation with the
evaluation
so as we all agree to accept under certain conditions the prototype we'll have look to the final sh financial view
yeah
mm
okay
so we need to calculate the production cost
mm-hmm
as i said in the first meeting we need to have so a remote control that would cost not more than twelve and point fifty euros
mm-hmm
mm-hmm
and if not if it's not the case y you would have to redesign it
oh yeah
yeah
so just have a look at the okay here is the
excel
sheet so so it has the energy source
we have hand dynamo
no we don't use that
no
we have battery right
yeah we have battery
kinetic we don't have it i suppose but we have solar cells
no um solar cells yeah
um how many do y do you need solar cells
do you think one would be enough or such as
uh i think in each ball you have three three uh yeah three yeah
as number of branches
three
three three solar cells
so electronic
single simple chip on print
just one would be necessary
s s simple simple yeah
one
yeah
zero for the others
and sample sensor sample speaker
one
mm
one maybe yeah
as we have voice recognition i think
yeah yeah yeah
so the case
is it
is sh it
so we are all already nineteen
wooden
okay just keep on going just to have an idea
the solar cell is too expensive
yeah
is yes a wooden pl i and that's there's no wood so plastic just only i think
well uh yeah but what what about case
uncurved flat single curved double curved
i think it's more like double curved
that's gonna be double curved yeah
double curve yeah double curve
one
one you have
uh wood
but it's yeah a a rubber uh
rather four buttons
oh no interface
uh do we need special colour
y maybe two
yeah yeah
yeah yeah that's special colours sure
we have two special colours
y y yeah yeah
push button
mm
yeah we have four
five
five
okay
scroll wheel
no
we don no
it it's more like integrated scor
i think that this will be like a scroll wheel actually
no no
yeah tha that's wheel
y you tu you turn you turn it so
no no no it
okay
yeah maybe two scroll wheel as we have the coarse coarse to fine scroll wheel
yeah
yeah true
yeah yeah
yeah
okay yeah yeah
scr
so no button supplements
i think the price is okay
no
okay
um no
okay we i think we have problem
l. c. display maybe
interface
i think we s if we keep on adding things so we have to
it's okay
fine
yeah w one of the m key point is solar cells
maybe if w t if suppose if we change and we g put just one
yeah
has it changed
yeah it was stage one so
no y i it did change but just imagine we have
okay
we have change the electronics to from from the the the sample sensor to regular chip
so
oh
we have to delete the the sample sensor i think
yeah
yeah but we have you the the voice recognition no
yeah but this one one of the feature we were not really
yeah it's the one it's m maybe we ha we have two versions the first version the basic version
okay
i think you can transform the wood into plastic maybe
advanced version we have speak
yeah
because uh it seems that this can be yeah wood into plastic and it it should be fine
yeah if
or it would be better
plastic is free
yeah
so do we need special colour
yeah that's one of the requirement
because we have red
yeah red and yellow
wait
red and yellow
we could turn we could turn everything in either yellow or black
fancy
we we can we can we c yellow
black then is a regular colour so
i think so we need if we try to have a kind of
yeah one
pineapple bee
yeah
so push button then it's it's the next expensive one
yeah
an but we have integrated scroll wheel with push dut button
and i think this is one
yeah thi this might be
integrated scroll wheel push button
so we'll we have only one
and push button
close to
so if we have all integrated i in the scroll wheel and push button it's uh
one
i can remove maybe f you have five with push buttons so we can just i dunno try to modify some of them to have yeah
okay so what's the bottleneck
how about we change the sale
double curved
double curve
we can transform the double curve into single c yeah
something flat
f some
yeah but flat
s uncurved
single curve
case what's the ca
yeah maybe not
yeah
single curve should be fine so
oh what
mm
ah we have one
and then one euro left
nearly
um
maybe don't bat no battery only solar cells
it's it's a bad idea so
um
i think there's a problem with the push push button
we only need maybe just one
two
one
just one
yeah
that's fine
okay
okay
that's fine
agree
so we have one button
so yeah you will have so one button and s
one s one scroll wheel so and the vocal chord it's fine
one wheel
scroll wheel with push button on it
it i th it's fine
so
it's good they're not charging anything for that
so yeah
it think we we've done good job as the cost is
cou could we have look
twelve fifty e
could we have look at the p the the prod the p the cost
yeah y actually it's wrong
we're not under twelve euros and a half
yeah but it's under or equal
it's not written
it's fine
sometimes it's under or equal
it's under or equal
okay
it's fine so
okay
okay
so let's say
twelve fifty
wha what yeah
it's fine twelve fifty uh
which part is the most expensive part
solar cells
the solar cells r is i is it
yeah i think
yeah i think it's not t t
i think yeah
but it would i be interesting for our marketing team to make a lot of advertisement concerning these solar cells to be
yeah to be able to si to sell it
yeah
cheaper
that's nice argument but if it's it's still four our of twelve
yeah with mi
it's it is really really uh really very very expensive though
yeah
maybe if uh okay
okay
yeah but it will be technologically innova innovative so
yeah yeah
yeah but we just have one button
so it's easy to use and powerful as the remote control a has only one button
easy
i don't know about powerful
yeah
it's easy to use
easy powerful
it's very easy to use
mm
so i don't think we need to redesign the p the product
no
uh that's what we've just done
we've done it with it is under the if it was low high or so
yeah
yeah
um
so
okay
now
so
so what are we going to do with this project evaluation
so
well i think we have just have to discuss if
okay okay it's fine
i dunno
so did you enjoy your clay modelling
yes
of course
this is my job
yeah
was it a nice way to create your remote control
yeah it's uh
it's good to
to create a control instead of a computer
yeah i think i find it really funny and amazing and interesting to go through all the process to from the beginning to the end
and designing looking at the chips the solar cells and uh and it was very informative for
yeah
and for the marketing guy
uh tha that was good but we should have more brainstorming like meetings maybe
yep
'cause we just presenting one is presenting his stuff
next one his stuff and then we try to combine afterwards so it um
okay
okay okay
and new ideas about new products maybe wi which would be fashion and uh
and yellow
yellow
i think you can think about a yellow t. v. now after a fruit t. v. or i dunno
it can be an interesting i don't know
yes just lemon
yeah just a lemon t. v. it'd be yellow lemon
yeah but y you know the traditional t. v. it's um
it's flat uh
yeah yeah it's flat yeah the shape is very boring
squared
yeah that's right
could we come up with new t. v. with such as this kind of t. v.
it's really boring yeah
yeah
so you can you have base triangle base so you the t. v. you can
ah the lemon t. v. with the pineapple remote control
yeah that's that would be really interesting actually
yeah
yeah
because the t. v. you also
oh that's interesting
you could f we could do a kind of fruit collection of electronics things
device devi
yeah
electronic device
yeah but just don't trust too much the trends
yeah
the fruit
yeah
'cause fruit and vegetables it won't last for ten years uh
maybe
yeah maybe la next year it will be insects
yeah it's
maybe two years it's dead
yeah
but i think it's good to follow the f flow and you know make it now and after
yeah
you know if the people change their mind you change also the product
mm
yeah but this is good because it's not a long long life product
yeah
t. v. is more like fifteen years maybe so
yeah yeah
if you have a lemon lemon t. v. for
that's a yeah yeah
we can think about t. v. with you know where you can change you know the aspects o like for the cell phones you know
fifteen years
customable t. v.
yeah you customise it every ti so every ti if people change you just change the appearance and y y you can keep
yeah yeah
ah such yeah
you've already said mobile phones
tha that would that would make it
okay
yeah
yeah you can keep the global appearan
yeah and following
the mood of persons the fashions uh
yeah
mm
we int
it's interesting maybe we can create a a line of uh t. v. with uh a a tr
yeah t. v. yeah
yeah
a t. v. for autumn and a t. v. for winter you know so it's
yeah
so what i and do w is it okay
so i think the costs are within the budget
we're just at twelve fifty euros
yeah the pr at
yep
yeah
so do you think you can celebrate your creation
and you can celebrate your leadership
oh thanks a lot
thank you mister david jordan
yeah but i think f it's really a celebrating object
yeah
so it's yellow and very a very ha it's very happy so
hmm
yeah
it's party party remote control
uh it's it's a pr it's like yeah
the thing now is to to sell it
yeah it's your job
yeah right go and sell it
sell it
goo and good luck so
yeah
yeah
okay and the twelve fifty twelve uh twelve
uh-huh
twenty five euros
twenty five euros yeah
yeah i think it's
it should be fine
twenty five euros
it's maybe a little bit expensive
it's cheap yeah
no i
no it's not so expensive
i'm not so happy about the fruit shape you know
wh really
it should be it should be fine you know actually
okay
s
maybe what you can do a test
yeah
put it outside and if bees come it's really fruit
i i think i like the the colour a the colour are very good so actually so
okay
but don't put sugar in it it's not working
no the colours are uh it's perfect yeah
it's perfect and
true
uh yeah another thing is the logo is missing still
i p is th y the the yellow ball thing that
yeah but the colour i think the colour is more is most important
uh
because i i don't think you have ever seen something like that before for a remote control
still that was one of the requirements we had
it's yeah but it i don't think it's such a problem just putting the logo somewhere
uh f like y we can we can put some uh double r.
yeah but we decided to have something yellow and red for the costs
yeah
so maybe we can just integrate it on th on one side the double r.
mm
okay yeah yeah
yeah
that's actually good idea so
mm
so we have the logo we have the colour and we have the fashion in electronics so we have the slogan too
so we have to give a
so we have give him give it a cute name
cute na
yeah th no it's the it's the pineapple control remote control
mush mushroom controller
you cannot say mushroom because it's not the trend
it's not a mushroom
it's a pineapple now it has changed
it's not the trend
it's a pineapple remote controls
it's a pineapple
pa
pineapple
pine apple
yeah pineapple remote remote control
yeah but just flying saucer or
with cherry on top
oh that
okay
i would say flying saucer
oh unid uh unidentified remote control so
it's more appropriate somehow
okay
okay
that's that's pineapple remote control
i think it's fine
mm
okay
will you buy one
yeah
yeah i will try i'll try
try to
twenty five euro
okay uh
i can hel i will try versions so to see how easy easy to manage
okay
yeah you told me you h you d you d you lost your control your t. v. so so you need to buy one
yeah i always lose my yeah so so i if it is a universal one i can use it with my t. v. so it would be
okay
one thing i like is the shape
mm
because you know it's not like the uh the remote controls you can put in your pocket on uh in your jacket
traditional one
yeah
so this one and this one
what do you choose
i prefer the laser remote control
i think i would choose this one because of the colour
what do you choose
no
it's
okay
it's will enlight your house your home and your t. v. so
okay
yeah
oh
maybe next if we decide to do something we'd can put light inside
yeah yeah that would be uh an idea
yeah but that's going to be expensive you know
yeah
we had some problems going to twelve euros and uh i dunno
i think it it would be interesting to just to see if we can if people will buy this one and maybe add some features to it after yeah
yeah afterwards if
yeah
yeah
if it's a new trend
okay
yeah that's that fine
so
so we can celebrate now
that's our new product
champagne mister baba
we should celebrate
yes
it's it's fine
it's
i like it
next time
so buy one
well i'll buy one here
yeah
so
mm
okay i will close this
mm
yeah
no
so i think we have finished the designing and the evaluation of our remote control
okay
okay
yeah
and we have a nearly final product
our final prototype which yeah
final prototype yeah ye yeah
final prototype right
prototype yeah
so thank you very much
okay
okay
okay
okay
very productive
okay
thanks
s so who is going to take the remote control
okay
good morning everybody
good morning
oh everybody is not ready
uh almost
ready
alright
okay let's go
so we're here today to to have our first kick off meeting about uh this new project we're going to tak to talk about in a few minutes
um so i will be uh sebastian the project manager
um you are the
i'm uh michael
i'm the user interface designer
okay
hi i'm guillermo
i'm the marketing expert
and i am hemant the industrial designer
okay very good
thanks for being here
um so let's have a look to the the agenda
so
we are going to go through this agenda uh and mainly first to uh to make to to be used to the tools uh available in this nice and smart meeting room we have here
um then we'll go to uh the plans for project and have general discussions about it
so the goal of this project is to uh developed a new remote control
um it should be original trendy and also user friendly
as usual we will follow the the project method um that we are using in the in our company
it is in three step as you know
first the functional design
the second's a conceptual design and then the detailed design
during each step uh of each design we wi you will work uh s separately
individually on uh your specific tasks and will m we will meet to um to discuss and take decisions about uh what you've you've you did and what uh we will do next
so first
we have to to train ourself with all the um the tools availables in the in this nice meeting room and uh particularly the the white board so uh we are going to go through the white board and take some um s some notes or do some drawings
so who want to start
ah well if no one else wants to yeah
mister
okay so want me to draw my favourite animal
let's see
well i don't really have a favourite animal but um uh i think i have one in mind so uh
you have one in mind
i'm gonna about the uh spider because you can actually draw it pretty well in the corner of a white board
the spider has a spider lives in a web
and uh
it has eight legs
and uh it can move all about the web in two dimensions
unless it's a three dimensional web which y they have sometimes
there are some spiders that live in like that have like uh kind of a a big ball of a of a web
and uh the other thing is some spiders can actually uh fly like uh they have uh they let out like uh a stream of like the web building material but it's it acts like a parachute so they can actually kind of go and find new uh build a new web somewhere else
so i think they did this in uh in charlotte's web that movie that little uh well it's actually a book first but uh
um at the end all the the spiders kinda flew away
so that's my animal
okay
th thank you
very interesting
guillermo you want to
'kay
i dunno why but when i was a child i i wanted to be a a panther not a pink panther or maybe yes
but don't you think it's very difficult to draw a panther
it would be very funny for us
uh yeah yeah
so bad i don't like it
oh
okay it's a friendly panther
maybe it's happy 'cause it just ate someone
yeah maybe
um
actually honestly i i i dunno what's what's his it's be behaviour i dunno if if it's the male who who hunts or it's the female uh
i i i have watched that lions di didn't hunt it's the the female lions who who hunt so but
i like it because it's fast and it's black as well so it can
he it can hide itself very easily and it's it's it looks like um powerful strong uh i dunno
i i watch a a film about a black panther when i was a child and i was in that age when everything was shocking me a lot
okay
thank you
okay
hemant
um sure
so you don't like pink panthers
i like it
oh yeah
thanks
this lapel is coming out once in a while
it's not very strong
okay
so not the favourite animal but i think i'll draw elephant
i'll try to draw elephant
it's a problem
okay thanks
okay so elephant goes like this
and then it has
four feet
i don't know whether there's any dist there should be any distance or not but
i think this is the easiest
and then we have it's trunk
and
yep something like this
an eye cute
yeah so
poor elephant
and sometimes they have a hump
it seems that uh elephants are pretty friendly and they they have one very important way a different way of walking
so when they walk wherever they are going to put their first feet the second feet will always be
when they'll come to that position the second the third feet will be there
that's the way they walk
and that's very peculiar about them
none of the other animals walk like this
and they are very useful to human beings
at least few few hundred years ago when there was no means of transportations or something
or when they had to carry huge um loads from one place to another elephants were very useful
and they are found in um usually the warm countries
and um they are the biggest terrestrial animal
that's what i know about them
so that's what i wanted to tell about elephants
so is this uh an indian or an african elephant 'cause you haven't drawn the ears
there are two kind of uh yeah they are very different indian and african elephants
so indian elephant is having one bump i think and the african have two
and then there's a difference in the trunk of the animals these elephants who are indian and
so at some for some elephants it's the trunk is having one
do we have some message there
yes
we have to i have to catch you sorry
wind up
okay some other time
we have to to go through the meeting
okay
thank you
thank you
we can discuss that off line
yeah we'll discuss a f a fly or do we'll do another meeting abo on elephants
thanks
so so another important part of the project is about money uh and about so about finances
so we should target selling price of twenty five euro for this remote control
and uh we have um which which would generate a profit of of um fifty million euros okay
and we should target the inter an international market
so could i just ask one question um
is this a stand alone unit that we're gonna be selling
so it's gonna be you already have a t. v. but you're buying an extra remote control for it or something
o this is the next topic we have to discuss exactly so let's go to it
okay alright
so um we should decide which kind of remote control we want to uh we want to uh we want to go
should be should should it be um specific remote control to some specific device
should it be a universal one
and uh etcetera
so um so i'm waiting for your for your inputs very quickly because we have only three three minutes to go
okay well so
it seems the the first thing that they've kinda specified is the price like based on how much profit we wanna make which seems to
a kind of a little strange if we don't know what the the product is yet
but i guess if that's if that's the requirement that we need to to design the the product to actually fit that
that price bracket so i guess we're gonna need to find out what's actually you know
what people ar are willing to pay for um what kind of product they're expecting for twenty five euro because it seems quite a lot for a remote control
okay
so it's
okay i think this is more a job to our market person yeah
marketing person
yeah
mm-hmm
so it should be the topic of maybe of the next meeting just to to have an overview of this and uh in which direction we should go
so we need to close the meeting
uh we'll have a new meeting soon and uh so the work every every of you ha have t d to do
so um you have to work on the on the working design
you have to uh work on the technical functions and uh you have to work on us user requirements specs alright
yeah
um you will receive some information by emails i as usual
thanks for coming today
okay
thanks
thanks
alright
okay everybody is ready
good morning again
so today we are going to have a f second meeting
oh michael hi
yep
you're late
you have a good reason for that
yes
very good
okay let's have a look to the agenda today
so we are going to have a meeting about the functional design
um so first before starting i w just going to uh to go quickly to through the minutes of previous meeting
so uh basically we we are not decided if w we should go for a universal or specific uh uh remote control
but i have new um new i inputs for about that topics
i goin i'm going to share with you
and uh basically we decided to um to uh go to individual actions for each of you uh so um industrial designer should wor was supposed to work on th on th on the working design
yep
you showed us you ar you you prepare something for us
yeah
yep
the u. i. guy also uh work on that yeah and for the mar our marketing expert should deliver some specs
mm
alright so so we are going to go through three of your individual presentations
but first i would like quickly to uh to decide of to give a name to the project
so i just put d quickly remo
but if you have any o other names that we co could decide for just to to keep something fun for our project we we should we could discuss quickly
any ideas
mm-hmm
uh the powerstick
powerstick yeah
what else
what else
uh
maybe a spanish name would work well
mm i was thinking of the
especially if we're selling into the u. s. market becasue there's a lot of spanish speakers there
maybe something that sounds cool in english but sounds funny in spanish
mando
mando
what is that
mango
mango
mando
mando
m. a.
m. a.
a. n. yeah d. o
m. d. o.
mm okay
it doesn't it doesn't sound cool for me but maybe for a spanish for i for
what does it mean
oh
what does it mean in spanish
control
control
okay
hmm
nice
'cause it also like in english it sounds like you know the man's tool you know because you know men like to have control of the remote so it might
but mm yeah
mando sounds
latino
the mando
okay
so let's go for mando
yeah
yeah yeah
no objection
yeah that's
great
and we could have some like you d you could have the fonts you know special
so
so you have man in like in in uh in one o in one font and then the o. as like
okay i think this is
although you don't wanna cut uh cut women out of the uh potential buyers though do you
okay
so
yeah they are the most t. v. watcher
so we should be careful
yeah
okay i think this is more a question of of i i think this is more a question of of look and feel
but yeah it uh
marketing
something that should be addressed later
we should we should go to other for the other topics
yeah because if the product will be international
well that's the thing
we need to know who we're selling it to before we can really decide on a
yeah okay so let's stick f to man mando for the name and we'll see for the for the look and feel later
um
so let's go for the three presentations right now
so who want to start
maybe maybe i should uh start
so maybe we could start with the market yeah
yeah
mm
okay
okay so i have your slides somewhere
yeah
should be in participant four
participant four
this one
yeah yeah
uh
s that's coming
uh okay
yeah
yep
great
okay so yeah i will i will give a brief outline about what i what i prepared for this meeting
mm-hmm
for the functional requirements and especially for the
for the user requirements
i prepare a marketing report and we have to find the weaknesses and and the the improvements we could do to the current remote controls
and also i di i did a study with for the incorporation of new technologies it seems that the remote controls have been have remained the same for the last five
ten years
there is no
no significant difference
between the the b the first new controls and
okay
yeah
sh next slide
okay
yeah
well more most of the people think that remote controls are ugly thoroughly
so and they they admit that the the they should uh s they would uh spend more money in a fancier remote control
which is which is good and it's interesting point
also the people are worried about about the r. s. i. disease which is if you repeat the sa the same movement
which is not a with a not very appropriate device you you will have problems whe when you will get old
so s people are uh are worried about the the shape of the of the remote control
they are also they get angry very often because they lost the remote control very often
so i think it would be a good point to to l to to find a a solution to any beep any alarm or something incorporated to with the remote control every time it it get lost
mm-hmm
and also i found that young people the the younger people are the more interested they are in incorporating new technologies in the in the remote control
okay
so in my opinion the
mando this mando shouldn't be very small because the smaller it is the more like the the liklier it is to get lost
liklier or more likely
more likely
likely
okay
uh people also complain because they they they all have the same size of the buttons for buttons who w which are not very use like f uh memorising channels or or this kind of actions which are not very often but
they they shouldn't they shouldn't have the same importance in the in the uh in the remote cont in the remote control
also the z the design should fit the hand shape
so it may be interesting to to think in a in both prototypes for right and left handed people
well th the on the thing is though most remote controls are used by more than one person
so
unless you're kind of targeting single people you know you're gonna maybe
yeah
cut out some a lot of your market
i dunno i th anyway i think it could be int interesting to to release some a a small fraction of of this remote controls
well maybe it could be a universal design
sorry
a universal design which is which is good for both the hands
yeah
still shaped for yeah for your hand but not for a particular hand right
yeah
that's right whether it's left hand or right hand but but don't you think that the two points are clashing
yeah
one thing you are saying design should fit the hand shape and it should not be very small
sorry
the first and the third point they are clashing
well it can still be a you can still extend past the hand
yeah
yeah
okay
like uh
uh
so fitting the hand doesn't mean much then
well it means like
this remote here is kind of is very thin and long so instead of having you know you might have it kind of a bit bigger or
mm-hmm mm-hmm
yeah like
you know with maybe some some finger molds or something
mm-hmm mm-hmm mm-hmm
so it means design should be similar to the traditional ones
little sleek longer
no no i was thinking of so like something yeah
and it should fit the hand
something with the shape of the palm
mm-hmm mm-hmm mm-hmm
some finger grips maybe
yeah
you could even have some buttons like you know on the sides and everything but
on the sides
yeah yeah
it sh it shouldn't it shouldn't be symmetric symmetrical
mm hm mm-hmm mm-hmm
not anymore
that's what yeah
and then finally
and finally the incorporation of a l. c. d. or a speech recognition system in the remote control could also be interesting but i don't know if the budget
would be large enough
yeah
yeah
first i'm just wondering about the l. c. d. stuff because uh because
but most of yeah most of the young people to thirty to thirty years old were really interested in this kind of technology
yeah so maybe it's a good time for me to uh to bring you to some new uh new informations
we had the new requirements from the so uh from the head offices of the company
and so they wanted so they want to um they would like to be restricted to t. v.
yeah
okay i dunno if you had this information already
no
no so they want us to restrict the remote control to t. v. only because of time limitations
um they want also uh
actually this marketing report is restricted to t. v. remote controls
excellent
so we have also to focus more on the internet aspects because well well te teletext is outdated now
and uh finally it should be clear that the corporate image
that means colours and logos of the co our company should be clearly inde identified in the product
i was still uh i was still working on this uh twenty five euro price point because i think actually having looked at some of the remotes out there
so
this is quite a low uh price if if we're maybe i can get to this in my presentation though but um yeah
yeah yeah
sure sure
so maybe we can jump to your presentations right now
yep
okay
okay so let's keep in mind about tha that that this last point about l. c. d. and speech uh reco
yeah
i think even even if it was within budget do a speech reco rec system it might be a bit difficult because if you think if you're watching t. v. you're gonna have a lot of this uh background noise from the t. v. which might interfere with the
sorry what is your
uh participant three
you might have some background noise from the t. v. which will make the speech recognition much uh harder so
yeah but you should be able to activate or disactivate so yeah yeah
oh you press a press a button to talk and the the t. v. the t. v. sound turns off
yeah uh channel fifty
yeah
no it could be command control kind of thing
it requir recognises particular sequence and then it gets activated
means you say you should say like does that remote control being on or be on kind of thing
and then remote control comes in the picture for the speech recognition
yeah
because this kind of thing means speech is there from the t. v. also
yeah
so there should be something command controlled you start and then you stop
mm
yeah
it's like v. i. editor you are having two modes similarly
otherwise it's just lying idle
okay michael
okay so could i describe the mouse maybe be easier to could i use the mouse or
sorry
um yeah
mm
thanks
okay
the wheel doesn't work
great
okay so um while uh researching this this topic i first of all just thought of a couple of things that i would like to see in a remote
and just uh looked to see if they're actually available in any current remotes
and then also searched for which are the top rated uh remote controls on epinions dot com
which is a a you know a a customer um written basically review site
so um there's a pretty wide range of uh remote controls these days and and uh this remote control on the right here is is one of the more extravagant
but it's not really it's by no means uh
mm you know on it's own in being so expensive
there are a lot of expensive remote controls out there
looks like a p. d. a.
so yeah it doe it's well basically all the functions uh are controlled through through the l. c. d. screen except for the really really kind of main functions
which have a couple of of their own buttons
um and if you look at a lot of the universal remotes out um on the market i know we're working on television remote
but a lot of the universal remotes out there have uh have these l. c. d. screens which kind of helps when you're using multiple uh devices i suppose because you can have multiple kind of functions d different functions on the screen at different times
but um the thing that i find most interesting about this remote control
and it's kind of difficult to uh to see in the slide but it has a scroll wheel on it
which is kind of like uh a mouse scroll wheel which i think is it's a really kind of important design aspect um is it's
'cause the thing is what a what we the presen this presentation we had is what we want the remote control to actually do
and obviously the the simplest thing that a remote control does is it just change the change the channel
change the channels
yeah
now um
uh the i think that a scroll wheel is actually pretty a pretty handy way of of changing the channel
'cause i know when i um when i use the remote to change the channel i very rarely use the numbers on the on the pad
mmm-hmm mm-hmm
i usually use the up and down because most channels are you know two digit numbers and you have to press you know a special button to enter a two digit number
yeah yeah
and then two numbers so that's just uh it's annoying
so i think a scroll wheel is is quite handy
now um the the scroll wheel is is much more useful if you have an l. c. d. screen
and this brings us to the the point you were mentioning before about the internet uh capability
mm-hmm
one possibility
if we now we need to still talk about the price point because obviously a lot of this stuff can't be done for twenty five eu uh euro but
one possibility is to download program information into the l. c. d. screen so that instead of actually saying i want to i want to go to channel thirty seven because i know this programme's on
you know often you don't know what ch what channel it's on or you don't know what's on
if you have a list of of programs on your l. c. d. screen you just scroll to that program rather than to a channel
so if you think about it's kind of like a you know in mobile phones now you don't use you don't remember people's phone number
you remember their name and you go find that name and ring it
so this would be pretty kind of a handy thing to have but um we we really need t to discuss the price
so i mean there are there are uh cheaper this is another multi kinda purpose remote control where it's it's it's very simple
there's only a few buttons but al each of those buttons does something different in a different context
so this is something else we might wanna consider is really kind of limiting the number of buttons
because this is the top rating uh universal remote control on on epinions
it it's really uh maybe worth thinking about limiting the number of buttons as much as as possible um because really i think people want to be able to find the button they're looking for without even looking at the remote control
and was saying before about having different size buttons for different you know frequently used uh tasks
but i think also you know the location and and shape of the buttons is important but also the number of buttons
so if you have too many buttons it it it increases the the difficulty of finding the one you want
but there is one problem then the user has to understand each of that functionality
so
mm-hmm
yeah well we w
because the same button is doing too many things
yeah well we will have a bit of a simpler uh task in that we're only doing uh a television remote control
um i think maybe one option is to have you know a little flip open um door that uh that you have hidden most of the time
but contains the extra buttons like say the number buttons for instance
mm-hmm
um
i i would if i had my perfect remote control i'd probably just have no numbers at all on it because they're just in the way
mm-hmm
they don't really do anything
maybe you know i although i do also find flip open doors a bit of a pain because sometimes they can break off or or whatever
but maybe a door that you can you can permanantly remove or permanantly have on would be good
mm-hmm
um but i think definitely you need to to keep the buttons down to a minimum
but not not let that kind of interfere with the functionality of of the device
um
h i think i think that the tr the transition to this to this new remote control shouldn't be very very abrupt very hard because w if people see a remo see the see a remote control without numbers mm they will think it's very difficult to learn very difficult to very different build very different to the traditional
it does sampling out of the
well i guess that depends on how you market it
if you if you have the right advertisement showing how how how easy it is and how you can
if y
you know navigate to a program without the numbers then people might say that looks pretty easy
okay can you continue please mi
so but yep
um okay so
i think um one of the really kind of useful things you can do with with internet connectivity would be to have this a programme driven interface rather than the channel number
so if we can have a higher priced uh remote control i think that would really be worth uh something that would be worth implementing
um mm there's the l. c. d. screen um which maybe maybe is too expensive um but i think also at the scroll wheel
i haven't mentioned it here the scroll wheel could be used without an l. c. d. screen just for changing channel numbers easily
i think even that i mean that would be a fairly cheap thing compared to an l. c. d. screen
mm-hmm
to implement um but i think that would be quite useful as well
and the other thing you say we need to we need to keep it just television
but i think one maybe one option since this is supposed to be a kind of a fashionable device
is you know there's a certain kind of cool or wow factor that you can kind of you can have with technology
and maybe we wanna make it something that's extensible to do other tasks
say you have like um a little another little kind of base unit that can also receive signals as well as the television where you can
say uh change the lighting in the room
you know that would be something maybe you could sell as an extra so that it doesn't have to be part of the initial development
but you know later on you could you can you know you also selling the potential of the device
then you say potentially you can then do other cool stuff like change the lights
i dunno close the windows whatever turn the heating on and um
i think that's something we may need to have as as at least as an optional extra to to kinda make our product cool
okay
since we say we're putting the fashion in electronics
okay
okay thanks
you want to go
yep
so yeah
so most of the things which we are discussing about is speech recognition uh that means on my own i yeah it should be
this one
great
no not that one
you are two
two
alright
okay so the working design is uh user i interface could be of two types
one is the usual press buttons which are there so that the user feels that he is knoing doing some he is knowing about that technology
so he is pretty comfortable if he wants to get this
and on top of that there there could be a speech recognition technology also being sitting on the on the remote
so the old kind of users who don't want to have any changes it can
it can be useful for them and the new users as uh our marketing expert was saying
they can use the new gizmo which is speech recognition kind of thing
okay sorry to interrupt you but we have seen before that there is a new way of interacting that use wheel
that's right
so anyway that didn't come into my mind so th that is a possibility
okay
these could be other kind of interfaces
means we can have depending on the cost how much we can afford we can have different kind of interfaces
so spe buttons are something which is very everybody is familiar with
so if you go to the market and you say that buttons are there the people know what it is
mm-hmm
and on top of that if we are having extra functionality people are willing to shell that twenty five euros money which we are thinking
otherwise we are just like others in the market
so anyway that is the first user interface could be of more than one type
and uh yeah that means we can do the on line changes which which cannot be done now actually
so apart from the speech we can have the scroll kind of thing with the buttons
now for buttons normal requirements like bit coding and all those things are required
and for voice limited vocabulary automatic speech recognition system is required and we require a microphone also to be sitting there on the remote
yeah
that increases the the cost also
uh that's right
but uh means we have to see how much what kind of microphones and stuff like that
do you think that performance of such systems are enough to to target well of such technologies is enough
uh yes if it is limited vocabulary usually it's enough
okay
yeah we we can uh target means we can target ninety five percent accuracy or somewhere ninety seven perc
well wh uh i imagine also that the microphone will be an ambiance um a um an ambience microphones because you are not going to speak into into th into the remote control
hmm
that's right
no it it could be little d yeah it could be
so it could be s a few centimetres
well one one other thing that that speech recognition could really blow out the price for is uh when you want to sell into other markets
that's right
that's right
though because i'm not sure exactly where we're gonna sell this but i presume it's not gonna just be english speaking countries
yeah
so then you have to s you know you have to train models for
mm-hmm mm-hmm
uh it's more like means there are different speech technologies which are existing so d. t. w. could be kind of which is the easiest
so you have to store some templates on the on the
on the chip itself and it's just dynamic time warping where you try to find out what it is
instead of having a model which has to be trained and being a micro controller
yeah
okay
okay we shou we should discuss this la later after after after this this uh slide
yeah that's right
yeah
so we can
this is a this is a this is a a very important uh issue in discussion
that's right
yep
okay next
yep
uh that finished
no no
components
no
components
yeah
so will you go to the next slide
yes sure
yeah so this is the design which we are thinking so
we are having a power button and the switch which is not much
and then we are having the which is to indicate whether the power is on or not
and then there are two kind of things which can be so one is the button interface which has not been shown because because of lack of time
so we could not put that
so now where the a. s. r. decoder is sitting similarly there are different kind of interfaces which could be there
so there is a. s. r. decoder which could be there and then there could be another scroll button scroll scroller
and then there could be buttons and all of them they will just do the decoding and put it in the math put it in the proper message format
and then there is there is the chip which is sitting the green one and it converts it into bit codes
and that bit codes are sent by the infrared device to the receiver
okay
so this is the easiest design the there could be
so th an a. s. r. decoder we can have things in
to have different technologies
so this was the my personal preference was that we can have a. s. r. sitting there on the remote control
you know i guess you could actually train the remote control as you're using it by saying you know turn volume up
yeah
and you press the uh press the button like uh s people teach sign language to kids f well by speaking and doing
yeah but uh as soon as you try to put the microchip kind of thing or something the price will go up
okay
yeah
so these are the slight problems
so your
your opinion is that we should go for special condition technologies
because yeah the reason is that if we go into the market means though i don't have much idea but as he the uh marketing expert presentation was
i'm sure if you can sell a a speech recognition remote control for twenty five euros everyo everyone will s will buy it
actually i'm not so sure because i'm the you know if i was using a remote control to say
so if we go with just the
i'm sure
turn the volume up because i can't hear it very well
i don't really want to you know drown out what people are saying by talking you know when i'm when i'm instead of pressing up on on a remote control
you know if there's some there's some dialogue all of a sudden that i can't hear
yeah
i'm trying to actually find out what's being said so maybe speech recognition gets in the way more than it helps
okay so
yeah but you know the the average frequency of pushing buttons it's about
well it depends if it's a remote control th
it's about eighty eighty eighty pushes per hour or something like that
maybe if the remote control is something that y you don't actually have to pick up anymore that would be a a useful feature of the speech recogntion
if you can leave it sitting on the table and you don't actually have to find it then that could be
mm-hmm
mm-hmm
mm-hmm
mm-hmm
mm-hmm
mm-hmm
okay gentlemens we have to take some deci decisions right now
alright
um so if i if i kind of summarise everything we've de we we said
we are targeting t. v.
we need we need to have um um remote control which is fanc fancy
which is uh which is easy to to hand not too small not too big
um we have or good shape yes
with a good shape for the
we should bring new technologies for young peoples and uh as we have uh also requirements to to use uh to to push thr toward the internet
maybe this is something we can stick to it
and um also
a very interesting things i i i've seen on on on the one of the comp o our competitor is this wheel that we can use to navigate
so so my feeling is that re regarding costs budget we have an an an target price it's not possible to go s to go to l. c. d.
and also to go to automatic speech recognition technologies
uh first m m why not to go to l. c. d.
because um in fact as we are targeting uh t. v. in fact we can use t. v. screen as a screen to feedback to to give some feedback informations about what we could have
well it depends though well it depends
if we we don't unless we have some input some video input to the t. v. or we have control over the t. v. then we can't actually display that
like if we if we produce the t. v. s then then yeah we can put you know menus up up there
but otherwise we need to actually have some kind of something sitting in between the video signal and the and the t. v. to superimpose those those menus
so that's an extra
yeah that's right
don don't you ha don't we have contacts with uh people on t. v. or or well systems that exist that we can use
cost
well this is this is another que we still haven't really defined the remote
are we still you say we're focusing on t. v. but is it still a kind of like a universal remote in that it's a replacement remote control
or is this something for our own line of of televisions
yeah
'cause that really makes a big difference
'cause even if we have contacts we can't really produce a remote control that can bring up menus on other other companies' t. v. s
it's just there are too many t. v. s out there
it's it's not really gonna
yeah
that's good point
what's what cou what could be the cost of uh well
could we fit the the targets uh in terms of cost uh if we go s to l. c. d. on the remote control
for twenty five euro
yeah
it's not possible
i think it's impossible
it's impossible
but but i dunno
yeah
i think um it would be good to know if there is any leverage in that any leeway in that um that twenty five euro because for twenty five euro i think all we can really do is provide a very basic remote control
and that seems to be kind of against the philosophy of our company which is you know putting the fashion into electronics
so i would i would like to know if there's any chance of of increasing the uh
uh
of increasing the unit price
what would be
so you mean yo you mean we we should target something maybe which is which would be more expensive but re really fancy in terms to um in terms to had to have really an added value
yeah
yeah
yeah because yeah
okay so regarding the automatic speech recognition i think this is
wha but what would be one question what would be the goal of putting an l. c. d. in a remote control
well th
what what kind of information
'cause you can have things like the programme name instead of the channel numbers like an interactive programme guide
yeah but mo most of the t. v. s nowadays show the show the
they have tele teletext
well because they have teletext on it
the n
th th you have a teletext sin signal that you can that you can uh that you can get thr through the channel
yeah but yeah most of the t. v. s have teletext nowadays
they have t most of them have teletext
yeah
but we want to get rid well one of our requirements is to uh to move to teletext to uh to the use of internet
so to to uh
you can get a lot more information on it
to browse more easily the teletext
for instance through uh through your remote control
so what would what would appear in the in the l. c. d.
so you could have the name of the programme you could have um the start time you know where it's up to
the ti the start time all the p all the programmes you could have uh o
you could have a l even a little image of you know the c you know the the m the main actors or something so you can quickly just kind of even without reading
okay
well i don't know if this information is available from teletext also
well no but there are the electronic programme guides out there
are
they may not have pictures but maybe they do
there's dependi it also depends on the country
well because for the same reason that we cannot
uh informations on the t. v.
we c we couldn't grab information information which is not there
no but i mean with the internet you have flexibility of where you get your information from
so it may be possible that there are people out there providing that
so so that mean w w we need an in an extra internet connection to use the remote control
but
uh
if you want to browse in addition to the t. v. or uh or it should be a special t. v. connected to
yeah
well i i think if we're gonna i think we would definitely need the internet connection because even with y i don't think you could even get teletext information from the t. v. onto the remote control
especially if we don't control the t. v.
i dunno
we need to find that out
okay
we need to close the meeting
um so
but just a small thing what kind of market we are targeting
very quickly
is it that we are targeting the replacement remote market or what
so the remote has gone bad and the person wants to buy a new remote or because the cost of l. c. d. thing could be as high as the t. v. itself
that is very important
no
mm
if it's a really small t. v. maybe
yeah well people go to buy another remote control when they broke n broke their
broke
okay
okay
and they want to go t for universal one and they take the fanciest they can have
okay
okay
okay
okay
so this is that we z that that we should target
so the com the um the uh the committment is the following we don't go for speech recognition technology
mm-hmm
the l. c. d. is still on disc is still open to discussion
it is up to you to go through this um uh this way and to to report report me back next meeting
so
i think that the speech recognition technology would be cheaper the than the l. c. d.
it's it's cheaper as compared to the l. c. d.
yeah but not sure
maybe it's cheaper but we have no
because with the l. c. d. you need more requirements
you need a internet connection
you need m more things
but
for the speech recognition you you don't need anything
well the thing is i think i think the type of peop
you just say channel fifty and that's it
i think the type of people that are gonna want to buy a very stylish rem r remote control with lots of new technologies are the kinda people that are gonna have you know a wireless internet connection maybe
or a you know
but then we should move to another target b because at twenty five dollars it's
means th yeah twenty five euros is yeah that's right
well this is what we need to find out
can we can we increase the the price point of this remote control
'cause otherwise we need
okay this is this is an open question for you
yeah
this is uh up to you to tell us
but i'm definitely not keen on to to no no no i'm no i'm definit definitely not keen on going to speech recognition technologies
to move to another target
i'm not confident enough
i'm not sure that that we'll have a product really that work
i uh that work
it's kind of hard to guarantee that you're gonna
it's real yeah
how to guarantee such performances is really hard
the expert uh said ninety five percent
ninety five percent is not good enough though
well this is still is is very bad
so this is the end of this discussion
next meeting uh here are the task you have to work on
um so you have to work on the component uh concept
okay
uh you have to work on user interface and you have to go through a trend watching
okay
so the question is still open about the l. c. d. thing
um uh we i hope that next meeting we will uh we'll take some um decision that direction
thanks
yep
bye
okay
good afternoon
hope you have good lunch
afternoon
hi
yeah we had falafel
oh
nice
and you
uh yes i had something similar
but non vegetarian
okay
so today is um
our third meeting
it will be about the conceptual design uh
if i come back to uh the minutes of the last meetings
um
we decided not to go for speech recognition technologies because of some reasons and we are not decided about u the use of l. c. d. screen on on the remote control because of costs
so maybe we cou wi will be able to clarify this this question to today
uh at the end of the meeting we should take decision on that point
so i hope uh that your respective pr presentations uh will help us
so each of you have some presentatio presentation to perform um who starts
okay
so marketing
so you are you saved your y your presentation somewhere
yep
so you're four
four yeah
which is trend watch
okay
mr marketing experts
yeah that's me
so
uh
well i investigate the preference more d i investigate deeper the preference of the users
uh so the the current investigation th uh th uh sorry the current
the n
current trends
yeah
yeah
mm-hmm
okay
okay
well wha what i found um can you
next slide
yeah
yeah
thank you
what i found in order of importance from less to more important is that
people want an easy to use device
after they they want something new technologic technologically speaking
but the most what they what they find more more interesting more or more important it's uh a fancy look and feel instead of uh instead of the current
the current trend which was f the functional look and feel
so now more more cool aspect
ma more a cooler aspect uh rather than a device with many functions and many buttons with instead of i instead of ha of a device which can do many things
a device which is pleasant to to watch to see
okay
uh also
well in in euro in in paris and and milan the in paris and in paris and milan the the current trend of uh of clothes
furniture and all this
all this fashion it's it's fruit and the the the theme is fruit and vegetables
mm
and also in the in the u. s. a. the the current the mor the most popular feeling it's it's a spongy
spongy means eponge
mm-hmm
so maybe we should we should think in in this direction so
what what do you mean by fruit and vegetables and spongy
what you mean clothe
spongy means it it's like sp
fruit vegetables is the the new have you seen the last exposition of clothes in milan
no i missed that one
yeah i i didn't miss an i didn't miss and i saw that the fruit there are many fr pictures of fruits and vegetables in the clothes
oh they're okay so they're not like dressed as a carrot they just have like pictures of fruit on okay
no no not not yet not yet
yeah yeah
so we're not gonna have a remote control in the shape of of a banana just maybe
so te textu textures yeah
yeah
vegetable textures and all this kind
drawings of bananas
uh yeah yeah
okay and
uh-huh
but what's your suggestion how we can have some shape like that on the remote
well so this is in the next slide certainly
uh no no it's not
it's not
it's
so which fruit are you thinking of
and
um
i ha i haven't thought of any particular fruit but the general aspect of the of the remote control
may may could remind some kind of vegetable some kind of
instead of vegetable some natur mm uh natural object or something
mm-hmm
but yeah it it depends on the
so maybe you maybe you can display a banana on the l. c. d.
oh so you want the remote control to be the shape of a fruit or you want just some kind of like fruit logo on the
means buttons are in the shape of fruits buttons are in the frape shape of fruits or something apple banana something like that
yeah maybe the shape the shape
no not n not not too much focus
apple for channel one
not too much focu not n not too s not too similar to a fruit because next year the ten the trend the trend will be different
mm-hmm
mm-hmm
so we shouldn't be at re really attached
to to the trend but
so something that looks half like a fruit and half like an elephant
for instance yeah
african or as an elephant
that we can discuss afterwards
okay
but okay i'm not i'm not really sure
if uh that would really appeal to everyone though maybe just to fashion gurus
like maybe just like a little bit n a little fruit picture somewhere in the corner
but i don't know about uh i dunno how ergonomic a an orange is
well ma maybe we we should further specify what target are we focusing
i think in my opinion we should focus on on young people because they are more open to new devi new devices and also yeah according to the marketing report ninety p ninety five percent of young people was
to fruit
was was able to
to buy a a n a cooler remote control
but is it uh is fruit cool
what
that's a question
what
is fruit cool
yeah
uh
is the new trend
of the
well i guess you know apple has the ipod so imagi just 'cause they have an apple on their
on their product doesn't mean fruit is cool
no i think we we should think about a a shape with it a device with a shape of some
okay but it has to be easy to uh to use though and to hold you know you don't wanna pear or a watermelon
yeah
don don't you think we can find uh the shape of a fruit which is handy to use
well probably the only thing is a banana that i can think of a cucumber
banana
mm-hmm
i dunno
or m
maybe too long
maybe
too green
maybe
so but i mean you also have to you have to also have fit r all the buttons and you know
a banana
um
it's it
yeah
the thing is you have t normally with um with buttons
they have to be at some point attached to a circuit board so if you're gonna have things like on a cylindrical kind of device it may be difficult to kind of to build
i don't th it will be rolling a lot
yeah but i li i like your idea that we shouldn't have a lot of buttons b buttons so
okay
yeah and you you you will not have pla enough a lot of place to put a l. c. d. on a banana also
yeah
uh do you want a an l. c. d. with twenty five euros
well you're the marketing expert you should tell us if it is too much or not
well this is
i think
well according to the to the report people are more interested in in a fa fancy look and feel and in a technological inno in innovation
so i will give more importance to the look and feel than rather than the
so
so you you you suggest to go f
new inputs and also it's i'm not convinced about this l. c. d. because you need uh internet connection
you need more things it's not just buying a new control re remote you need buying control remote buying uh
okay
s so you're simply you're simply looking s to a remote control that looks like a banana with few buttons with only a few buttons
more things
it's not so simple
for instance yeah
yeah for for for given an an example yeah
okay good
so maybe you can go ahead
yeah no it's what i already said
okay
thanks
um
okay i'll give the floor
so you are user interface guy
okay
so you're three
yeah
and it's this one
yep
go for it
yep
okay
so
s next uh slide
okay
so i received an email um around lunchtime letting me know that the brilliant minds at our technology division had developed an integrated programmable sample sensor sample speaker unit
um which is a way for you to have a conversation with your coffee machine and or remote control
but it's just a speaker right
it's no what it is it's it's very
it's not a microphone
it has a has a microphone has a speaker it's got a little chip and it allows you t
mm-hmm
actually i'm not reading microphone there so that's why you can all have conversation it just to speak to you
well it's a sample sensor sample speaker
sample sensor sample speaker
it means that it can recognize
mm-hmm
it can do like a match on a on a certain phrase that you speak and then can play back a phrase in response to that
mm-hmm
mm-hmm
mm-hmm mm-hmm
but uh there's no kind of um understanding of the phrase
okay
so i mean you know i guess you could build that in
you could you could link the the recognition of a certain phrase to some function on on the remote control
mm-hmm mm-hmm mm-hmm
but basically the thing is we have this technology available
in house
in house
so
mm-hmm
um but the thing is obviously there's still gonna be a cost if you decided to integrate that because you still have to pay for the c production of the components
mm-hmm mm-hmm
so um it it but it basically means we c we can kind of consider this from uh you know uh a theoretical or usability kind of viewpoint without worrying too much about you know how to develop it because we have this already done
mm-hmm mm-hmm
whilst you know some people might get annoyed if we uh if we just dump it
i there's something that i
unclear really understanding
is this a technology that recognize keywords speech keywords
it's it it's no well it's it'll recognize uh i guess keywords but you know keywords in a certain order like a phrase
you train it for a certain uh for a certain phrase
you say the the example they said that they have uh up and running with their prototype is um well they've actually integrated into the into the the coffee machine that uh that we're producing is
you can say good morning to the coffee machine and it can recognize that phrase and it'll playback good morning how would you like your coffee
and it's just to it's just to playback something
yeah
so actually that was a bad example 'cause it doesn't actually ask how do you want your coffee because it can't really understand the response so
yeah yeah
so this is not s really to do to to do control
only like only in the sense that it it can recognize a set a set target kind of word an
yeah
this is just more like a poi pois yeah
it's designed it's designed as a fun kind of thing but i guess you could use it as uh as a way to implement uh
yeah yeah
so it it's c uh it it it is a uh uh easy uh a fancy thing that you you can bring to we can bring to the remote control that will not have any uh yeah comp completely pointless for the inter for from the interaction point of v point of view
yeah but you can u
completely pointless yeah
yeah
yeah unless you know you like having conversation with your remote control
okay
yeah but the can we use it for saying okay channel fifty channel twenty
well yeah that's the thing
if you can but you have to pro though i think it's a fairly simple design so you would have to record into the device every possible combination
you have to s tr train it to l to learn channel fifteen that whole thing
not just the word channel and the word fifteen it doesn't have that kind of logic in it
yeah yeah
so this is so this is this is much more than tak taking this technology bringing it to the remote control and using it
mm-hmm
so
yeah that would be some development work
so this is out of discussion
yeah
so if if if it is something that you can we can bring easily and to put it into the banana remote control
m mando
banana mando
no this is mm banana bando yeah
banana mando yeah
banana man
uh then it could be cool yeah
yeah okay let's go ahead
okay
i uh i i i don't think it's worth it though i think it doesn't really add much to the functional
design and it's it's it's not mature enough
to use as a speech recognition engine so
okay
um yeah
so if we can just move on to the next slide
i've just done a quick mock up of uh uh some of the features of our potential funky looking uh remote control
it doesn't look like a banana at all
well you see i was i was unaware at this point of th of the fruit focus
yeah
um so at the moment it's more of a box focus
looks like a tr look likes a a tro a tropical fruit
but you you can fit i you're saying now you can fit it to
yeah well this is actu this could be a genetically engineered fruit that's designed to be you know square so that it packs tighter in the boxes
yeah
yeah
but um i've just indicated here we could have actually two scroll wheels 'cause i think the scroll wheel is a fairly um key part of
stable thing that's right
you know i think everyone has has agreed that it's that it could be quite a useful um thing so
to have mm-hmm mm-hmm
but i think it's important you know to have two scroll wheels because
you know you want one for for the channel but you also want one for for the volume
mm
because it's it's the volume i it's you know it's very handy for it to have uh instant kind of uh feedback uh and response so
mm-hmm mm-hmm
but um i've also included this turbo button because i think you know every design should have a turbo button
what's a turbo button
and well so this is you know a unique problem with with televisions is that if you have this scro this scroll wheel for the television
the uh the tuner on the t. v. is not gonna be able to to switch between stations as fast as you can scroll
so you know the th the person might want to have a uh
might want to be able to scroll past television stations without seeing what's on them
in which case it just waits until you stop scrolling and then you know displays that station
or they might want to scroll and and have a quick glimpse of it even if it lags behind what they're doing
it con it controls the speed
yeah so with this turbo button you can say skip over t channels if uh you know if i'm if i'm going if i'm scrolling past them and you know
it's um you could have a little red light that comes up when they press it so they feel you know it's really going fast or whatever
so yeah that's um those are the two important uh features i think we need on the remote
mm-hmm
but i mean we can discuss about what other kind of buttons we need um
you know i it could be you know if we if we wanna have like a very cheap kind of device i mean
we could either consider that maybe we want to sell this as a very if it's gonna be a banana you know that's a pretty gimmicky kind of
thing that doesn't have that much functionality
it's just you know a couple of scroll wheels and a button cause it's hard to get so many buttons on a banana and it's still very it may even be for most for some people more functional than their current remote
it's enough
but if they have these scroll wheels so um you know what other buttons do we want
mm-hmm
i mean we could have well i guess you need an on and off switch
switch on
but you could you could o you could turn it turn it on by taking the top off the banana maybe
yeah
you know it's kind of like a spy kind of flick thing
yeah
so sounds crazy
i like crazy ideas
that's why you're a marketing guru
okay
yeah of course
so i it looks like we're going completely to forget about the l. c. d. thing
well that's the thing as have we decided that we can only spend uh twenty five euro
i think that
well not spend but you know charge twenty five euro
i i think we could use somehow the s coffee machine dialogue interface or so
no we can we can't use that
you we can
we can't use that to
we can't
communicate
to comman co communicate it's just a thing
yeah but we can say channel twenty five
it's one way
no
no
but then you have to have a template for every channel for a hundred channels you have to be able to to recognize
it's not a lot one hundred templates it's not
mm-hmm
mm
well i f i think it's probably more than
than our can handle because it's designed for a coffee machine you know to say hello in the morning
yeah
ah it's designed for a cof okay
is it design for a coffee machine
well that's its current application i would presume that it's kind of they wouldn't design it to handle a hundred things th so
okay
yeah
maybe you could ask your the you could ask the engineering department if we can
mm-hmm
yeah
a good good good thing
but uh
you want to g to move to your slides
yeah that's right yeah
you're finished
well i just i just made the point i don't i don't know if that speech recognition is you know
even if we can do it i think it's not really appropriate for uh television environment
yeah i think so
but um i did have one thing from a previous meeting
you were talking about um being able to find the remote control and i was talking about extendin being able to extend the remote control by having you know
yeah
a base station that can control other things as well
mm-hmm
it might be useful to have some kind of base station
even if it's just you press on a button on it and uh and the remote control starts beeping
you know this is a way of finding the remote
y in that case maybe the maybe the speech recognition the speech thing could be useful just to say i'm here but uh it's probably a bit of overkill if you could just have a a beeping
mm
exactly yeah
so it's a speech synthesis kind of thing something has been uh stored and it's just uh spoken out
it's speech
it's it's speech synthesis and s it's speech kind of not really speech recognition but kind of pattern matching yeah yeah
mm-hmm
oh good idea
yeah
that's right
very good
okay let's move on
so you're two
that's right
okay
so this is going to be about the component design
mm-hmm
so first thing is we need power source for the remote control
so i was of the idea that we can have two kind of power supplies one is the usual batteries which are there
they could be chargeable batteries if there's a basis station kind of thing and on top of that we can have solar cells
when the lighting conditions are good they can be used so it'll be pretty uh innovative kind
then uh we need plastic with some elasticity so that if your if the remote control falls it's not broken directly into pieces
there should be some flexibility in t
i guess that fits in with the spongy kind of design philosophy
yeah
yeah
so there should we should think of something like that and then it should be double curve
the s science for the ease of handling and there are some other issues why we need double curve
then controls for the traditionals u traditional users we can have the push buttons so that they don't feel that it's an alien thing for them
so just one second when you say double curve what do you actually mean
you reckon you could like draw us a thing on the on the whiteboard 'cause i'm not sure
double curve is you have curves on both the sides if i'm right
so it's symmetrical kind of thing whatever it is
okay but like kind of convex or concave
so it could be curve so it could be convex conve concave depending on what what we want
mm-hmm
okay
so there are flats there are single curve and there are double curves
okay
these are the three things and there are different materials with plastic you can have double curve but with uh certain other materials we cannot have double curve
so there there was uh there were many other materials like wood titanium and all those things
but plastic is i think is the most appropriate one it'll bring the cost down and anyway it's
yeah
although you know wood
could be uh quite a stylish uh option if you take like
nice quality kind of wood that's got a nice grain and you kind of put some some varnish on
mm but i but there is no elasticity which could be
wooden cases
well it depends i mean
you have the outs the wood itself is not gonna break so you don't have to worry too much about the case being broken it's the inside
yeah but the components inside
yeah but inside you know you could have you can still have some kind of cushioning that's not visible to the to the user
mm-hmm
yeah
very too expensive to do
mm-hmm
yeah
and i mean you could also you can have just a very thin veneer of wood as well
and also uh
yeah but it's more easier to do a banana in plastic than uh in wood
that's true but are we set on the banana
idea
actually
well it look like it looks like you are all targeting that yeah
i was thinking that the
the shape of a banana is not
it's not really handy
yes it is
uh i don't know the name o o in english uh
this it's not a fruit it's a vegetable
is it an e apple which has
it's like a pumpkin or
yeah
pumpkin
green
green
green
um um um yes i see
what does it taste like
and you put in the salad
pep pepperoni
um
ah yeah is it what's it in french
poivron
oui c'est ca
yeah okay so capsicum or pepper
uh pepper
yeah
pepper
but um they do d
and it's al it also suits with the double curve for easy of
yeah
i don't know it seems a little bit kind of bulky to me like
no i mean in a
yeah
it's not re it you you think it's really fancy and fun
like with a banana you can have
you think that young people that are
i'm sure it's fun
yeah
more than a banana
but banana is not so handy i think that's handier
banana is more handier as compared to this i think and to capsicum
well
but like a banana you can you can be holding like this and have the scroll wheel kind of on top and just
yeah
roll it back and forth like that but with uh i don't know how you would hold a capsicum and
it's kind it's kind of it's more uh it's really ergonomic it's fit in the hand and you've a lot of surface to to put the controls
okay let's move on
yeah you're right
so time is running let's move on
okay so push buttons for the traditional users so that they don't feel they are alienated
just and a scroll button with push technology for channel selection volume control and teletext browsing
these are the three scroll buttons which are already available with us in the company and we we can go ahead with that
okay
yeah we can go to the next slide
then uh there are different kind of chips one one is the basic chip and the regular chip and one an adva advanced chip
so we can have regular chip for control
pricing is a factor for us that's why we'll go for the regular chip
and uh regular chip supports speaker support so this functionality could be used for tracing the mobile phone which has been misplaced
so is that when you say speaker support you mean it just has some output pinned which which which kind of
it could be a beep kind of thing
okay but the speaker is actually attached to the to the chip in some way or is just the the signal
yes yes that's right it's it's onto the chip most most probably not not hundred per cent sure about that
okay
okay
so are there any issues where we place this this chip to make sure you can actually hear the the speaker from the outside of the banana
that will be the volume control i think which which a user shou it it should be already pre defined
it should be whatever will be the case the chip is always going to be sitting inside
okay
yeah but the speaker if the speaker is actually on the chip then if it's too far away from the the casing
mm-hmm
or if the casing is too thick then you may not hear the the speaker
uh so we can have it at one of the boundaries so that things are slightly better
yeah
as or as hearing is concerned we can have some gap at some place so that
yeah
so that's something we have to keep in mind with the actual physical design is to keep the the speaker close enough to the outside
that's right
okay
yeah
so these these were the component selection and these things
we can go to the next slide
and uh these were the findings which i i saw with the web web
that user wants to have control more than one device wants to control more than one device from the same remote control
so our t. v. remote can have little extra things to support additional devices like v. c. r. d. v. d. players which are usually attached with the t. v.
because users are like this and they don't want to have one remote control for everything
so with this additional little we might be having slightly better market for us
although if
it depends if we like if we are concentrating on like a fruit design
then maybe maybe we wanna sell a collection of fruit you know like a different fruit for each device
mm
of fruits
mm-hmm
cause that you know that sometimes people like to collect um you know things that of a similar type
remotes objects okay
s objects
crazy objects
i think that would be funny at the beginning but after one month you will be tired of be surrounded of fruits
well you're the one who wanted to do fruit in the first place
no but i think just one fruit to control everything
like a power fruit
a power fr a power m a mando a supermando fruit
and uh as well as i could see on the web the scroll button is becoming really uh hot thing s and we should have it on the remote
yeah
okay
actually i i didn't understand very well this trace speaker lost control
well
okay good
so you're having a basis station
okay
your usually your remote sits on that
so you and it's that's why it can have chargeable batteries
now let's say
so you you have to buy two things the banana and the basis station
bu it's it's
basis station is with the thing
you s you you thing
it's like a telephone handset is there and the basis station for the telephone hand set is there
so now what user gets additionally he doesn't have to buy batteries they're rechargeable batteries so over the period of cor time he'll recover the cost
so you're having the basis station and there is a button if you press that button wherever the remote it'll start beeping so you know where the remote is
i think that's a pretty handy feature
uh
yeah
yeah
i think it's kind of people would find that worth it even if it wasn't uh a recharging station
even if they didn't have to buy extra batteries you know
mm-hmm mm-hmm mm-hmm mm-hmm
yeah but i'm a bit worried about the budget
so
uh this is basis station is nothing more
just it's a wire which is coming from the main cable and uh you're having one socket on which the thing sits
mm-hmm
although you do need to include r. f. kind of circuitry in the remote
that's right
but all these things are usually in house so we don't have much problems
so component cost is going to be the least
anyway we are not using really advanced technology l. c. d. has already been ruled out a. s. r. has been ruled out
so it's the basic thing but very trendy and very user friendly
okay
and
i'm just wondering actually 'cause you know i this whole fruit thing with the banana
it's um it seemed like it first seems a bit kind of uh niche
like only a few people would really want a banana but what if it was kind of uh a stylised banana
you know rather than having it kind of you know yellow and really looking exactly like a banana you could make it kind of silver
and um you know to give you kind of the idea of a banana but without it looking you know completely
kitsch
for better want of a better word you know
you think that yellow it's kitsch
mm-hmm
well you know i don i don't know how many peop
if you make something that looks like a banana it should have the colour of a banana
yeah
no i i
a yeah otherwise it'll be mis means you don't get b any feeling then
well they
o otherwise
maybe li like that
it's neither a banana nor a
yeah like this colour this colour
maybe you know maybe like still in the shape of a banana
roughly
no exactly
exactly
um but you know just maybe maybe not exactly the same texture as a banana and just kind of
you know because the thing is it's gonna be a little bit difficult to make um to give like the texture of a banana anyway and to k to have the exact shape
i think if you're gonna not be able to do it properly you may as well do it in a stylised way that just looks a bit more kind of
you know twenty first century rather than sixties or seventies
yeah
okay
and uh going to the last slide
let's move on
uh uh yeah
before before st before ending the meeting i'd like to to draw some sketch about the pro future prot prototype
okay
go for it
okay
well no not not you you can finish your slides before
okay
okay so
anyway users'll be so the findings is users'll be very interested in our locator device to find their misplaced remotes
mm okay
so that was very i thought it's a very good suggestion by everybody
okay
that's it
that's all
yep
okay so mm so well done for the presentations
so we need to take some de decisions about um about what we're going to do
so i i propose that you go to the whiteboard and we're going to report all the ideas we had we had during this these presentations just to draw some sketch about what will be the prod final product and uh where superman go banana and uh uh extra func functionalities such as wheels
yeah
okay
mm-hmm
um the speaker unit um well not in order not to lost the um the device i do i don't remember you call it
that's right
the basis station
basis station yeah
that's right
uh so um so we're going for a stylish
banana shape
yeah so
i guess you wanna hold like the way the end of the banana you wanna kind of hold as ma you maybe wanna kinda hold like a gun rather than 'cause you don't want it to point kind of towards the floor
yeah right
so
you know so if you have like
what about what about this shape
more or less
we
there's less space on this to put with the buttons
i if it i if it has really the model shape of a bana you could the the starting is good but it could it should have more the shape of a banana if you want to point really a at the thing
yeah but how many buttons do we need
if you don't want to to to do that movement which is which is difficult if you don't have to do it in fact it's better
uh what about a
so ti time is running we have to we have to we have to to move forward
so let's skip to uh this uh this this this idea
yeah
okay so
so we have this
so
we have a a basis um how do you call it
the base station
a base station
right
we'll have a base station extra uh on the side
okay so i guess we need you know something that can fit a banana
shaped object
mm-hmm
yeah
yeah
uh we have a r. f. for um for beeping for beeping
that's right yeah we need that yeah
we need b r. f. to beep
okay so it's uh
so we that means we need a button on th on the on the basis
yeah
basis station
basis station thank you
yeah yeah
alright so we need uh okay
can you go quickly please
yeah
okay
so we are going to add uh also um you as you suggested the whee some wheels to control the volumes and channels and your tur turbo turbo uh button
yeah
yeah which i think it's it's probably best actually on the on the underneath of the the device so you have
turbo button
yeah on the th yeah maybe here
and the and the wheel a a at the level of the thumb for instance
yes
yeah so you have the thumb kind of here
and and you have two wheels
so yeah you need one one here and one on on the other side so you got volume an and channel
okay right
good
and uh
so no l. c. d.
no l. c. d.
okay great
um
very good
okay
oh we need a we need a power um on off switch as well
yeah
uh for the remote
yeah
oh just the switch no f not for the t. v. for the t. v.
remotes don't have power on off switch
yeah
uh so you
okay
s no that'll be controlled by the those buttons'll be there already yeah
what a
where
means on the remote
on the side
because remote is going to have both the interfaces scroll as well as buttons
okay
they are not going to cost you much everything is in house and now you don't want the traditional users to be apprehensive of this
well i dunno if the traditional user is gonna buy a a banana remote
oh yeah
in the first place you know
that's that's another issue which i didn't think of
y i mean you need to kind of keep it um
but you know our targets are very high means fifty million euros is the profit which we want make
what about
yeah how many of these did we wanna sell
i can't remember what was
twenty five
twelve point five is the profit on one
twenty five
yeah but how many units did we need to to sell
uh forty th four
four millions
point point four million
four point four million
point four million
that's a lot of fruit
in the market
what about a
yeah
so
well
no
time is running we have to close the meeting in a few minutes
okay
so okay the next step you can come back to your seat
okay
the next step is to go for to f is to go to uh
to building a prototype based on this okay
okay
so next meeting you guys have to prepare the followi things
you have to uh work on the look and feel uh design and you have to work on the user interface
in fact you two you have to work together to model the first uh f first prototype
mm-hmm
uh marketing expert uh have to go to product evaluation
okay
i wo what about adding the this word spotting keyword spotting recognition saying volume up volume down
it's too difficult
it's too difficult but people like innovation and that's really uh innovative and i don't know if it would cost a lot just a few five words
it's not a possi it will not be possible to implement it for the next prototype so t it's in the next prototype so let's skip it
uh
okay
for the future prototypes
yeah maybe for the n if if if it it works well we'll go for uh an orange one
that can be the t
that can be like the turbo banana plus plus commando
yeah yeah honour the fruit
plus plus okay
maybe objective banana
okay
thanks very much
we'll see n next meeting
bye
so meeting's over
okay
yep
okay
we have to go design the prototype
okay
okay
thank you
thank you
thank you
the problem is after all this meeting there is
okay
good afternoon again
so we should have our final meeting about the detail designed of detail design of the product of the remote control
um so here is the agenda for today
uh uh just going to go quickly through the minutes of the last last uh meeting then we have a p presentation of prototype of you two sounds interesting
and we'll have um presentation of evaluation crit criteria by ou our marketing experts
then we'll have to go through finance evaluation of the of the cost of the thing and um hopefully uh we should fit the target o tw of twelve point five uh uh euro
okay
so let's go
uh if i go quickly through the minutes of the last meeting
so we went through th uh w we took this following decisions
no l. c. d. no speech recognition technology okay we went through a b to a banana look and feel for the remote control
we went through the use of wheels and but buttons
and also the use of a basis station for battery ch charging and uh also to um call the to call the mot mote remote control when it is lost
okay
um
good
so guys
let this uh wonderful thing
okay so we can go to the slides
oh yeah
sorry
yeah
um
number three
oh number two sorry
which is
so final design
final design
okay so
michael you can go ahead
yeah so uh following our decision to uh
make a yellow well to make a banana
yeah can you show it to the the camera maybe
remote okay so
we actually have a
you can pull it out first maybe
we've well first first of all we made a an attractive base station uh with a banana leaf uh look and feel um and uh
mm-hmm
bana sit the banana sits in there k you know nicely weighted so that it's not gonna tip over and um this is the remote itself
it's kind of it's it's ergonomic it fits in the hand uh rather well
we've got the two uh
uh scroll wheels here which you know one on the the left for the uh volume and the one on the right for for the channel and uh underneath we have the uh the turbo button which is in like a nice uh trigger position for you know for pressing quite naturally
what's the use uh of the t turbo button already
this is when you when you uh are scrolling the uh through the channels you can tell it to to skip th past channels that you quickly rather th
ah yeah yeah an then you stop when you stop it stops
yeah
well when you stop scrolling the wheel it stops
but normally with uh it will just uh s stay on each station briefly so you can see the the picture
uh
uh-huh
and we we do have one more functionality
if you take the banana as such and uh you press the turbo button so it switch ons the switch ons the t. v.
the t. v. yeah
which one
the s the turbo button
the turbo button
so rather than having uh an extra button for um for the on off switch you just use the turbo button
okay
additional button
what this button for
this is a teletext button
okay
so once you press that then you get teletext and you can use the the channel selector scroll wheel as uh
to navigate it through th through teletext
but if you want to go to page seven hundred
to navigate yeah
that's right that's right
yeah
with the wheel it's easy
how man
well then you can you you have like a little uh number selection thing
you press the the the teletext button uh to move between uh the fields and then you can just scroll the number back and forth so you have s you go you scroll to seven and then
zero zero and then you can uh
i don't understand it
can you repeat it
well you can you can press press the teletext button and then you then you can you can f
yeah
so then then both the scroll buttons they are for teletext browsing
and you can tele yeah once you press the teletext button then the scroll buttons they are more for teletext
ah okay okay
okay
mm uh
okay okay
okay
they are no more for channel or vol volume
i see
i see
yeah
okay
okay
and this is the uh the infrared uh port
that's right
also the top of the banana
yeah
excellent
so
and then we have in the uh in the base station we have the the button at the front for uh for calling the uh the banana
calling
yeah
excellent
and the the leaves plays the roles of of antennas
actually they do
that's that's yeah that's uh that's form and function in the one in the one uh object
oh
yeah
so it always means whatever the rays goes by they they get reflected and then you are having a better coverage
it's like antennas
yeah
so
but yeah that's um that's just like that's an attractive um base station
great
so
okay
so what else
and for the power source we are having solar cells and rechargeable batteries and this and uh the basis station is going to have the input from the mm power line for for charging the batteries
is it really weight
is it light or
it is very light
yeah they're light
okay
it's it's uh it's about the weight of a banana
okay
you know to give you the correct look and feel
yeah
ok
and we have put these different colours so that people don't mistake them mistake it as a banana
okay
otherwise it's you know a child comes and so
yeah yeah yeah i see
i under i understand
i think a child would try to eat it anyway so maybe we should
yeah
consider that
maybe health and safety aspects
ah yeah
mm-hmm
oh we didn't think of that yet
yeah
yeah
so for the power source apparently you still you you want to use both solar cells and batteries
oh yeah that's right
uh you mean okay
so
i don't really know if the solar cells are actually necessary any more if you have a recharging base station
yeah where are going to where are you are you going to place them
mm-hmm mm-hmm
it'll it'll be always at top somewhere at there
if i was gonna place them i'd put them on the on the top here since that's like uh the black bit but yeah i don't i really don't think it's necessary to have the solar cells anymore
you have enough surface
you
yeah because now we are having rechargeable batteries so that that is
okay
mm
what will be the autonomy
roughly
the what sorry
the autonomy
autonomy
what do you mean
uh i mean how long does i how how how long can it be held off a station
how long the how long the bit the batteries long
ah
ah
a long time
yeah
no no no it can it should be weeks
eight to ten eight to ten hours
a long
n most no most of the time it's not being used
yeah so it's
yeah but y people don't like to put it back in the base station all the time people leave wanna leave it on the couch so
so when when you are making it on
it's used only when you
mm
mm-hmm
no eight or eight or ten hours of working
if you are just leaving like that it'll be much longer
ah okay
okay
yeah
f weeks
yeah
yeah
that's right
right
next slide
yeah
and we are having the speakers regular chip for control
pricing is was a factor so that's why we have gone for a regular chip only not the advanced chip
and uh that's it
okay
okay
those really sounds very good
that's right
nothing else to add
it seems to be falling over
i l yeah
yeah
i like i like it
maybe the the thing that convince me the less is the the multifunctional buttons
looks a bit
you want to have more functional buttons
looks a bit puzzled uh i dunno how to say that
you the the b the buttons change h h their function depending if y it's teletext or not
you are not convinced
not not many we we want to keep it simple
so that this button fo is for teletext which is usually also the case
that usually there is a teletext button and once you press that the channel buttons they baco become the scrolling buttons
and the volume button will will become
it's up to you means
now that
well in fact b both will be could be useful navigating through teletext
means let's say this this can move the the larger digits and this can move the smaller digits
or can move between positions in the in the number
that's right
and what about people who want to use digits
yeah
butto real buttons
wow
yeah
so there was there was a constraint that the surface area which we have on this banana on one side because of the shape
so we are targeting a segment which is which is just very trendy kind of thing they they don't care about the buttons any more
okay
and anyway
because have you thought about configuration and all this kind of uh stuff
it's all automatic
it's all automatic
yep
okay
okay yeah it's fine
very good uh yeah you th yeah
w we are living in a wonderful world
uh
bananas everywhere
okay so
automatically configure
so we have to go through now evaluations
evalua yeah
yeah
so your slides are ready
s
uh you're four i think
yeah
so this is one which one is this one
yeah
okay
i i const i constructed a a list of criteria based on the on the general user requirements
and each criteria is will be evaluated it's uh logical criteria so we must
users must say i if it's true or is or if it's false in a in a scale ranging from zero to seven
why this strange factor of seven
because i
i'm sorry
sorry
usually i have seen that scales are from one to ten
ah yeah
it's from sorry it's from one to seven
it's from from one to seven sorry
because it should be an even
it should be an even uh scale and five
okay
num number
okay
mm-hmm
is too short and nine is too long
okay
i'm a i i'm
okay fine got the idea
so to have in order to have enough granularity it's in order to have enough granularity in the evaluation
sorry
yeah yeah
okay
the variance is mi it's is minimal
okay
okay okay great
i'm um answering your question
okay
okay
yeah yeah
go ahead
and that's the criteria i i found more useful
i think i sh i i could write the criteria in the on the whiteboard
mm-hmm
sure
and we all four could range
okay
yeah yeah
could evaluate the
yeah
okay
so you can say fancy
handy
handy
okay let's let's evaluate if it's fancy or
yeah it's fancy according to me
seven but
yeah six
seven
s seven
seven by me
six
i would say seven
okay
it's quite fancy
so you can add seven plus six plus seven plus
no wait
yeah uh five
what do you say seven
five
five
five maybe maybe maybe six it's it's i guess it's yeah
okay six point five
handy
again i'll give seven
seven
i'd give it a six like i'd i think it's probably more handy than my current remote
six
yep
'cause of the scroll wheels but maybe loses the point for not having you know the extra buttons when you reall if you do need them for some reason but you know you can always use your other
remote
so seven seven six
seven for me
yeah
six
six point five
functional
i'll give five
four
i would say
well it depends when you say functional do you mean it does what we want it to do
or d does what it does you know can it make you coffee
everything ar
uh for a remote control does he have all the
you know
mm everything
yeah
yeah
you could expect
it's compared to the all
that's right
remote controls
that's right
that's before
the standards
what is available in the market off the shelf
yeah
i have to say four
actually i don't know what are the r the real specification of a of a universal remote contro
well it's not a universal remote
we
remember we're focus we're supposed to focus just on t. v. s
ah it's not an univer but it's for all kind of t. v. s
yeah
well all t. v. s but only t. only t. v. s i guess
so it's universal but for t. v. s
so s uh four
yeah
five
five
four
four
four
four
so four point two
just four
four
four
so four
obviously there are some outliers so
okay cool
cool device
there i'll give it seven
it means cool features like
new features actually
that's right
which
for a t. v. the most important feature which i felt was the locator which is a cool feature
and then the scroll buttons are again cool features
we don't have l. c. d. for it but
that we decided we don't want to have
yeah
seven
i would say five
i'll say five
mm-hmm
six
seven
plus six i say i said seven
yeah
so it's six
s yeah
you said seven
yeah
'cause it's five five seven seven so
okay
uh okay definitely easy to use
definitely seven
seven
seven
seven
and you
five
outl you are not lik outlier
seven
okay okay okay okay
okay
sorry i have them
alright now here's the sixty million dollar question well twenty five twenty five euro question
of course i'll buy the banana
what do you what do you guys reckon
of cour of course the most difficult question for the end
i'll say five
well
i'll say five
hmm
twenty five euros
cheap
i find it quite cheap actually
i dunno
if i i it depends if you live in in switzerland or you live in
yeah so the target price is for all europe or only for rich countries
it's more targeting u. k. or
i don't know
wha the initial specifications were for the whole all europe or
uh
so this is selling costs not production costs
yeah this is the the initial specifications
yeah
yeah
yeah yeah sure
um
five
i would say six
it's quite cheap actually
i'd say two
aw should be nice in your
why
i don't want a banana on my living room table a banana remote
no but it's really handy actually if you see
it is handy it's handy but it it's terrible
it's it's so handy
and then
it's kitsch
anyb anybody who comes here anybody who comes to your home he'll at least ask once what is this
yeah
yeah but it's not a positive thing
it's a very positive thing if you see like that
well you know it's it's handy it's ergonomic but it's a banana
well don't forget well don't for don't forget who we're targeting also who are f f who are wh yeah youngst youngst
youngsters
actually maybe
yeah but it says i i would buy this so
no well yeah i if you would be young
yeah
not telling that you are young
no it's i
li li like a teenager for instance
okay you're you're crazy teenager and you like fun things
i would buy
you want to flaunt
yeah
you with your girlfriend or something
yeah you want to show the beautiful banana you have
s s
or might be it does some other kind of thing but
still i i'd say two
i don't think i at any stage in my life i would want a banana remote control really
uh yeah crazy
okay so you s you give oh yeah yeah i know i know
i can say maybe there is a market for it i dunno
so you say two
yeah
i say five
f i d i say five
you say
i change the question
so what's the new question
and you have saved it
so yeah upload the
you'll have to reload
uh yeah i think so
okay so it depends if uh
yeah it's two different situations
if you really need an universal remote control or if you
would change your remote control for a n for a new one
yeah that's two different question
if i had t if i had to spend twenty five euro
if that was like my limit maybe i would buy it
because the other twenty five euro remote controls are probably gonna look
they're not going to be as
ugly
worse than a banana
and they they might not be a as easy as this yeah
and it yeah this is gonna f you know handy to use
yeah
so
what now
s
i stick to five
what range
i go slightly up
although it still has it still has the word of course at the beginning so i dunno
six
six
um
w we have six five
i'd give it i'd give it a
three so we are
i give it a four now
six
six
six five four
six five four
six so it's uh five point five or less
yeah
so
okay
so and last question will i change my rem change my remote control from mando banana
um zero
no uh we can't
so one
actually yeah i we
well if
yeah
no uh let's say i'll put two
i'd say three i mean my remote control is kinda at home is pretty terrible
if it was change my remote control of my d. v. d. player for a mando banana then i would be more inclined to but uh 'cause it's really bad but uh i'd say a three
it's for the t. v.
i'll still give it five
five
yeah
you are romantic really
two three five two three fi and two
so it's somewhere three point five i think
i would say two
so it's r
yeah three point five
who is the outlier
wh wh you said five
no no you say five he is the outlier
no i said five
okay just just do a sum
i don't know if it's a
it's not very promising but you know
we're not young trendsetters
no because there are more yeah we shouldn't sum like that
well maybe we should we should uh have a look globally glob
because the the last two questions is much more important than the rest actually
mm-hmm
otherwise we wouldn't we will not sell
is there some some formula you're using that says you have to sum them up
uh no i didn't anything
well just leave it at that then
yeah
oops
yeah the uh
so maybe maybe w we can we should stick to general feeling
yeah
we can had uh have a out of these numbers which which is that well we should go for it
problem with connectors
do you want me to sum o i think it's not
yeah it's it's funny
no
i think it it kind of you just lose information if you sum it so
okay
so let's move uh let's move on
yeah sure
okay now now we have to mm to estimate uh the cost okay
so i prepare an excel sh uh an excel sheet
um well we are going to calculate the production costs
we should we should be below twelve point five
so i already uh put some pu some numbers here okay
we are going to go through so this is the number the mm number of components we need for this thing
so it appears that there were things that we didn't thought about
uh and also things that i uh i d i forget to uh to put like solar cells
mm-hmm
well we decided against the solar cells so
oh yeah finally we say no
solar cells yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah we said no to that
okay so let's let's go let's go let go through all the lines
so hand dynamo
this something we didn't thought about
but
you mean charging it by shaking the banana
yeah
i think rechargeable batteries will take care of the power thing
yeah
yeah
to bring the cost
okay so we we stick to battery one
yeah
no kinetic also
i don't i don't see the difference between kinetic and dynamo
well maybe dynamo is like you have to actually
ah you have to ah okay i see so kinetic is really uh shaking the banana
s
yeah
yeah
crazy
okay
so those banana is falling
okay
let's go ahead
so we we st only have one for battery
uh then for electronics um so i didn't put anything for the
so we have the regular chip on the print which is one
yeah
yeah
and that's it
okay
no so we hin
and we have sample speaker
yeah so one
yeah
yeah
the cost of that is very high
ooh ye ye ye the cost is increasing
well actually that that no that sample speaker is not we we're not using that
so we are
we're just using the the very beep simple beep that s that sample thing is like the voice recording and everything
the beep
uh-huh
that's what
mm-hmm
mm-hmm
okay so i'll remove it
so
yeah
i say that
s
yeah
and we have sev
so don't we need a
oh there is no listing for r radio frequency thing
yeah
so
so we we'll put some extras if there is something
yeah maybe
we'll see later
mm
okay so in for the case um
i put single curved
okay
to reduce the cost it's okay
well wait a second no it's it's double curved it's got a c it's uh
because we have two things
oh it's got all the directions so don't worry
no
well d yeah it's monotonic but
it's got a direction
it's got but if you hold it
if you hold it that way that's two curved
one on this side one on that side but they're opposite sides
well
actually what's the differen
what a what i if i put one here
this is actually i mean this probably
this probably actually costs more than three if you
yeah so let's put one here in the then instead of single oka all right
okay
okay
yeah
so we stick to plastic it cost nothing
yeah
that's right
well no didn't we say we wanted to do a rubber
no it's too no
too expensive
if you drop it
it's too expensive
well when okay
we're already at eleven
well we we'll come back we'll come back and see if we can fit it in
okay so i put rubber one
okay so special colour yellow
yeah
uh for the interface we have
we don't have any push buttons
no we have two push buttons
we have three
no that is a scroll wheel itself it'll be put in that
huh
no no
we have two scroll and we have three push buttons
ah okay okay
uh
okay okay
actually whe whe when you wrote regular chip you should put two because there is another chip here
okay it's gonna have to be plastic
and
no it's no chip
this is just radio frequency
yeah
th this is no chip
yeah but
no
you need
there's no chip there
it just emits the signal
it's just
and the receiver accepts it and that's it
yeah
fo i it does nothing actually
no
just se sends the signal that's it
just only
it's a recharger thing and uh
okay w we didn't think a thought about uh integrated scroll wheel push buttons
well i actually did um
think about it myself but i thought you know because you could potentially you know you could be pushing it down as you scroll it for a instead of a turbo button but you know the turbo button does add that extra class
yeah so
yeah
you know
so i mean if we're if we're over budget then maybe we could we could rethink that
okay
so no l. c. d.
so for we have no button supplements right
yep
no
uh
well in fact could we could not we consider this button as a button supplement because oh no
these are these are for colours co and special forms special colours and special materials
yeah
no we're not we don't need anything special for the buttons
so
okay so we are over budget
yeah
so first thing which we should take care of is
make it plastic instead of rubber
instead of rubber let it be plastic
yeah
and then we're basically o on budget except for you know ten cents
and uh that much money will be required for the base station which is not there
yeah
yeah
so mayb in fact n we have to put two here
because it cost nothing
yeah well pl the base station is made out of m many units of plastic
yeah
that's right
so might be ninety centimes for the the remaining things which the cord and everything which'll go
exactly exactly so we have margin for that stuff
that's right
does that include charging circuitry and everything
yeah maybe
okay good
yeah
wha
excellent
so what do we do with the extra profits
um we'll invest in r. and d.
okay
the next fruit
yeah
so well we're under the the the cost
so we can go to through to project evaluation
okay so now we have a product which nobody would would buy
would yeah would buy
sorry
no we have a product which none of us would buy
yeah because th th the evaluation project
which is different
which is different
none of us will buy it
no it's people in in in milan and uh in paris that are gonna buy it
ah would buy yeah
massively yeah
we're n yeah
we're not in milan or paris
yeah
okay
uh you have been in milan a couple of times so
actually there were a lot of
this is a battery
and you said the lowest
this is what we which you can mm
s
detachable battery
that's 'cause i'm sick of milan
it did yeah
yeah for the batteries
extra battery yeah
okay so um project process
exac
well in fact i i did not know i didn't know really what to say here
if uh if you have any ideas of what we can we can say
so
i don't i don't i don't understand what
what they mean by satisfaction um and for and for example
should it be more like um like a status of
of the these meetings in fact
yeah
yeah well in fact uh we we use a little bit the white board and the digital pen not that much
i dunno i think we had a fair bit of creativity
oh yeah it's really creative
and uh but i think one thing we m missed out of this whole process was a um like a focus group with the actual people we're targeting
we needed some of these kind of young trendsetters to come in and play with the banana and you know see if they
yeah
they like that
see if they like it
mm-hmm
yeah maybe we should go through yeah an uh evaluation
because yeah the evaluation for us is is kind of
biased
pointless
so maybe you should we should do a kinda evaluation
in the streets like asking to young peoples well do you like to have a banana as a remote control
yeah
because it it would also be interesting to uh you to know find out if we have a market in really young children as well
mm-hmm
to see you know how to how to market this thing
mm-hmm
yeah
'cause you know if well i mean maybe you don't wanna give all your kids their own remote because they'll be changing the channel all the time but you know maybe in some households where there is you know a t. v. for each kid
then you know banana remote control could be fun for them as well
might have to draw a face on it
mm-hmm
so but i think that's something we need to to work on next time is really finding out more about the target
market
yep
any any new ideas we could uh we could investigate next time
dunno oranges
yeah
the cost of the thing can be made more than might be
because i think it's just the optimal what we have done for the cost which we are looking forward to
yeah
i think there are ways we could maybe simplify the
interface
well just the the the circuit board that we're using inside i'm not sure really how complicated our um
mm-hmm
mm-hmm
our needs are
i mean all we have is two push buttons and two scrollers do we really need an integrated circuit to
hmm
you know to process that
mm-hmm
mm-hmm
mm-hmm
so more general remote control instead of just focusing on uh on t. v.
that's right
the complexity shouldn't be much higher
yeah
for you said if it good for d. v. d. then i would
and also fo you know for mood lighting and and stuff that would be rather cool
i think that's actually something that should be in version two
is the ability to you know to control things other than the t. v. and not just electronic equipment but you know the whole environment of the room
integrate
mm-hmm
okay
very good
so
so
what else
well done
i think we we can go
okay
home
home
happily satisfied
yeah
maybe maybe we can hassle the the
production department to to make a a real prototype that we can use at home to to evaluate
mm-hmm
okay so thanks very much
yep
okay
thank you
bye
thank you
bye
now what
'kay hello everybody
uh i guess you all know what is it about you all received the email i guess
uh we are actually doing this meeting to start a new project which is about designing a remote control
so i'm going to be the project manager of this uh project
and uh so i'm present myself
i'm fabien cardinaux and uh i i guess you can present yourself
so i dunno you can starts
okay so my name is petre
you can call me petre or peter if you like
i don't care
okay
uh my name's bob mor
and you are
in the project
uh in the project i'm supposed to be the technic
oh sorry
'kay
so my name's bob morris
i'm the marketing expert for this project
bob okay
bob yeah
my name is hamed getabdar and uh i'm going to be interface designer in this project
okay
so uh so today we are doing a short meeting to present the project so um
we are gooding we are going to present the tool we are we are going to use during all this project
we are talking about the project plan and we are going to to discuss about st our first ideas and so on and yeah
so we have around twenty five minutes to do this meeting
um
so what is the goal of this project
is to design a new remote control
so it should be of course new and original and um it should be trendy and user friendly
that mean it's a very challenging project and uh
uh
so w it's we will try to do our best and hopefully come with something very new and that
people want to buy
so um
so what's uh what are we going to do during this all this project
so it's more like we are going to do inv individual work all in o in o our specialities and we are going to meet each other quite often to discuss and to find a good way
um
yeah and everything is will be like this
um so now we are going to to get used t to to the tools we are going to use all during all this project
so we can try to use uh the whiteboard here
so uh
okay
for example we can try to write what is our our favourite animal and write the f our favourite characteristics about it
mm
uh
so uh
so i will ask you all to do the same
okay
just to get used to the whiteboard
so probably i would try to try to draw the animal
well sh should i draw the picture of the animal
i i th i think i should
yeah yeah you can draw the picture of course
yeah go ahead
okay so
um
okay american um
um
i would use the bird
so i tried to sketch it out
i had to first uh write it down because i am not absolutely sure if i can draw it but ah
can you recognise it as a bird
okay it's your turn to
okay okay
so i think my favourite animal would be a c a cat
oh
that's its head
um i probably like cats the most because they're cuddly and furry and uh playful
okay
i dunno if i should go with this
oh it's okay
thanks
if it is enough line
maybe put it up put it a maybe put it on the desk or something
i'm sorry
yeah
i should get used to the tool so
okay
oh just wait a little bit
c could we put it here to make it as straight as possible
ah probably not
they should be remote
okay it it works like this
uh that's better
okay thanks
your lapel microphone's fallen off
are you left handed
no
oh pity
okay
should i clean
okay i think like horses uh because they are strong and beautiful so if i want to write it here i think i can
oh
never mind
ah it's maybe better if you leave it
yeah
yeah
maybe we should just continue
yeah
yeah don't worry about it
no worry
no
okay
you won't draw them or
you can draw it if you want
i dunno if i can
just try
i would like to see how it looks like
okay
it may be like a cow or i dunno whatever
i'm not good very good in drawing
okay so this is very it's a bird i think
i dunno what is it
no i think it's clear
four
okay
mm-hmm
mm
yeah
i'm shameful yeah
oh that's good it's good
it's okay
it's in it's indeed beautiful
good
yeah and strong
okay
okay
bob
have to remember it
bob
so good um so let's talk about money
uh we are going to to sell we want to sell uh this remote control for twenty five euro euro
and uh our expected profit will be around fifty million euro
and uh we are trying to to have a market all around the world
so n not only for switzerland but for the world
uh
so um
the we expect a production cost of maximum
uh twelve point fifty euro
per unit i guess
yeah of course
y oh okay
um so we can start today to have a first idea of what we want to do what are our experiments with remote control and any idea
so if you have some experience good or bad with remote controls you can share it and say what you f what is your idea
anything
okay
well from experience um i've had remote controls in the past that have had very they've had lots and lots of buttons and they've been very small
and it's been very hard to to to use
because there's so many buttons and you know it's very hard to see which buttons do what and the buttons are very small and very hard to press
um and and normally you only every use you know on a t. v. remote you only ever use
mostly you know f four or f six buttons
mm
oh
um
so it's frustrated me in the past th that
okay i have also some points uh
maybe two points
uh first would be that in current remote controls there is no back light
so if you are if you are uh playing with this in the dark room it's it's probably worth to to have something like uh back light
yeah
and maybe it could be also dependant on the the amount of of light in the room
so that if if it's in the day it doesn't need to be back lighted because it works on the battery so
so something like this
and the second thing f second point from me would be that in a normal remote control there is uh there are two buttons for volume control
but i prefer like a potential meter or something like
yeah
ah okay
okay
you know some slider or not just two discrete buttons for volume but something which
okay
mm-hmm
okay n
mm-hmm
is that because the of the discrete volume levels or is that
yeah
yeah but i can reach in uh one second i can mute it down or or make a high volume
are you not afraid that if you take your remote control you can move the slide and it could the the volume can go up very quickly and it can
yeah
ah n
if it drops to the floor then it starts to scream
yeah also if y when you take the the remote control for example on the table
you take it and you push the button and everything is very loud and
yeah f it depends what what you feel about that
you have a heart attack
okay
yeah
yeah but we can we can think of these things afterwards but if you have some more notes on that
yeah so you can do you have something
uh i yeah just a simple experience
i uh i prefer um remote control working with radio waves
because remote control working with infra red rays you should you should you should keep it in a specific direction and then try it hard to tune
yeah that's true
yeah without obstacles and
okay
okay
um
let's continue
i have a meeting in five minutes so maybe we should hurry
okay
okay just a second
um
so we will close uh this meeting
so we will have a next meeting in uh thirty minutes
um
uh
the so i will ask you to do some work
uh the the interface interface developer will work on the on the design of the remote control start to to have new idea and
which i which is hamed
read about yeah
mm
okay
he's the industrial designer
no you're the industrial designer
yeah
uh i am the technical designer i dunno which one uh v
oh
yeah i think that's the first
industry and oh
uh-huh
i. d.
industrial designer
and the second one is the user interface designer
mm-hmm
user interf okay
and then last one's marketing which is me
yeah
okay so i'm the first one
so um
for the user interface designer which is hamed um
mm-hmm
uh you are going to work on the technical functions of the remote control
i see
okay
and for the marketing uh
manager i dunno okay which is bob uh
you are going to try to to find the user requirements f uh for the remote control
um you will receive by email uh the specific instructions and uh by your personal coach
sign
yep finished
so i see you in thirty minutes
great okay
okay
okay thanks
thanks guys
bye
bye
thank you
uh
so um nice to see you again
uh
so uh
tod uh for this meeting i will take the notes and do the minutes
uh so we will see our three presentations
um we will start with the uh manager expert wi who will talk about uh user re requirements whats user needs and what it desire for this devi device
okay can i have the laptop over here or
yep
oh i don't think so
i think you have to come here
okay
have to get up
i dunno
i think it should stay
excuse me
yeah that's it
okay
should stay in the square here
okay
oh maybe
okay so basically i'm gonna present some findings of a study we conducted uh into uh what users want in this remote control
oh you can put it here
oh that's okay it's jus
um so first of all we what we did is we um conducted a an experiment with a hundred test subjects
um we put them in a in our um usability laboratory and got them to you know um play with remote controls and also to complete
after they'd done that to complete a questionnaire uh to tell us what they like and what they don't like in remote controls
so basically um the major things we found out was that um basically users don't like the look and feel of of most remote controls that are currently on the market
um they you know seventy five percent of the people we we uh did the experiments on
found that rem remote the remote controls that they'd used in the past were ugly
completely ugly
um they they didn't match the operating behaviour of the user that is you know the the way users use remote controls when they're watching t. v.
um that the layout of the remote controls didn't match they way that they used it
um and
thirdly they say that w half of the users that we um tested said that they only used ten percent of the buttons that uh are on remote controls
um so we collect we also some collected some usage statistics uh based on how these test subjects were using their remote control
and from this we basically came up with the figure that
the channel buttons the channel selection buttons are the most by far the most used buttons on the remote control
um and you can see they're used a hundred and sixty eight times per hour on average um while the user's watching t. v.
um the closest button that was used well the cl the button that was used that was closest to the channel button was the teletext button
um which was used fourteen times per hour followed by the volume button which was four times per hour um
all the other all the other um buttons such as ch um audio and picture selection um configuration buttons and things were used
you know l approx well less than or equal to one times per hour
um we also asked users um which buttons had the most importance to them
you know which which buttons they felt were the most important buttons on on the remote control
and basically they came they said the channel volume and power buttons had the highest relevance to users um note that only power was very infrequently used
it only had a b a a fr usage frequency of about one times per hour but users ranked it as having a very very high relevance
um and the audio and picture settings had a very that well the users thought that um w the audio and picture settings were very uh weren't very important to them um
and they used them very infrequently a as well
so we asked users what what um frustrates them the most about um current remote controls
and
fifty percent of the users said that uh what frustrates them is losing the remote control um somewhere in the room and not being able to find it
um they also said that it um it takes a lot of time to learn a new remote control
especially when there's many buttons and it's a you know a c a a unintuitive interface
um and then thirdly
they some users commented on the fact that the the you know the way that you have to hold and press buttons on a remote control ar are bad and um cause u repetitive strain injury
we also asked some users about some specific features that they'd like to see in the on the remote control
in particular do they want an l. c. d. d display and secondly do they think speech recognition uh is a useful feature to have on a remote control
um basically our findings are that um amongst a younger age groups uh the answer is umv overwhelmingly yes
they want these features they want these high technology features
um for instance ninety one percent of pe of people aged between fifteen and twenty five said yes they want these features
whereas um the the trend was as users as users um became older and older uh they were less likely to want these sort of features in a um in a remote control
so i guess it depends on where we're focusing our our market
um and as our company motto is putting fashion in electronics
um i think we're focusing on the younger younger um target demographic
and so maybe we should think about adding these sort of high technology features into our remote control
hmm
that's my dic that's my presentation
thank you
thank you
okay
so um
maybe now we can talk about a user interface and uh about the technical function of this device
so uh pet peter can you talk say something about that
well okay yeah
yeah but the user user interface is responsible
no
b you think uh i i'm user interface manager
ah
okay so
sorry i'm sorry
okay
sorry
okay
if i could go there with this cable
you're scaring me with l. c. d. man
and speech recognition in remote unit it will be very e expensive
yeah it's true but you know they're features that users want
so it's and our production cost of twelve fifty euros per per unit is fairly high i think
yeah
so i think we can afford to to add these sort of features into our remote
yeah
at least we have couple of months t to work on it so so it will be cheaper finally
sh okay
it is true
where's delete button
okay
oh i'm sorry
okay
that's the wrong one i think
yeah it's still bob morris
oh
presentation three
because you cancelled it
yeah you should have put yes
yeah
oh
click on yes
yeah
yep
okay so here is my presentation about technical function design
i will talk about different components and s of system and how they react together
okay uh first what is a remote control
simply it's a device as you know for uh
for sending some commands by some waves to uh another device to to tell different commands uh with this device
and the main idea we don't use any cable and we can rec react simpler with the device
uh i it has different blocks different blocks
uh first is remote control have sh ha should have some electric circuits uh making interface with uh keyboard and uh r reading uh keyboard and reading the keyboard uh commands
and then inter then make uh these keyboard commands uh in interpret these int uh keyboard commands
and then there should be uh an electronic circuit making uh electronic signals according to these commands and uh finally there is a transmitter which is a cord or a a diode making uh making uh waves to transmit through the air and uh uh this air this uh wave uh will be received by the by the other device like a television or whatever
to uh r to realise the command
okay uh about what i found about uh different uh these different blocks are uh usually there are two different methods uh to for designing a remote control
they are based on infra red uh waves or uh uh radio waves
you still want me the presentation
there are two different uh uh solutions i mean
this is uh this can be uh uh the the differences the th between different kind of waves infra red or radio waves
and uh also as uh i understood and uh i think it was a part of uh bob
uh uh presentation people prefer to have uh to have uh the remote control with less button
so for the electronic part working and interfacing with button
we should we should try to t try to design a remote control having uh some some simpler buttons or some rolling buttons to just to just to search between different options
and showing o something on t. v. and putting less lesser stuff on the uh on the remote control
and uh personal preferences
uh uh uh uh certainly a remote control with uh working with radio waves is uh preferred because uh you can pr you can take it in any direction and you don't need to tune it any way
and uh uh again using bigger buttons and less number of buttons are also preferred as i see
okay
that was my presentation
okay
i have a question
uh-huh
do you think radio waves um will interfere with other appliances in the home
uh i don't think so because uh we can make uh we ca we can make this wave in a specific frequency
so they can be in a range which is not inter interfering with the with other devices inside the home
okay
so can we use any any frequency
yeah it should be okay
we have the right to use any frequency
uh no but as i know there is a range for uh for this uh f for for uh for this stuff for designing this circuit
we can we can we can tune our uh transmitter to work in this range and for this range we don't need to ask any permission
okay
and what happen with uh radio waves when two neighbours have the same have our remote control for example
and so do they have the same frequency or
uh for this i'm not uh i i don't know the solution but one solution can be something like putting uh p password or something inside the wave
so the only your t. v. can understand it yeah identification code inside the
okay
a kind of identification okay
yeah f uh i know about this since it's my it's exactly my field so
so
it's uh kind of handshaking uh
when starting to uh when you start to communicate with the your t. v. then then it's like an handshaking protocol with your your remote
yeah
so
so so if two two devices are trying to go to communicate with the t. v. set then the the the one which has the more energy in the wave is chosen
well it can be a problem sometimes but most of the time it works okay
okay
the password may simply uh or uh i identification code may simply solve this problem
a specific uh remote control has a specific f
yeah but we we don't have to think uh about this because i think as a function designer that we will use the already made uh circuits which we probably bu buy
it's worth to buy
hmm
and they have these problems solved so
okay
so we don't have to think about these
mm
mm-hmm
okay
okay
so maybe you can talk about the function and
yes
i have only a couple of things because i had i struggled a bit with the software that i'm supposed to use in this uh
uh
in this company
i was used to use linux before so
but i tried to
tried to break through this too i guess
mm
open
ah
okay
how to make it big
slide show
five
slide show
okay thanks
it should work so you can
okay
oh so i will speak about working design
that's the first slide
uh what uh i have to do
a look at what the other company okay so uh presently i am looking what is possible to use
what circuits to use and stuff like that because uh i didn't work uh with these uh circuits so far so i have to look what what is a v a v available on the market for for the communication for the i. r. circuits and so on
so i'm currently looking what is available on the web
and uh i wanted to ask you m maybe afterwards after after our discussion if we have some contacts in some companies
so which can report on what is going on there so i would be glad if you can tell me about them
mm
yeah
so you know
uh okay findings that's the point that i'm working on currently but uh so far i i was uh looking what what are the blue circuit
i mean radio wave radio frequency circuits are available now but the prices i read are high
mm-hmm
so
i know that uh the user interface people and these speak about radio frequency waves because you can you can uh you can make the t. v. do what you want even if you are in the bathroom or so on
mm-hmm
hmm
but you know
when you are not close to the t. v. you probably won't need to to change the program and so on and so i am i am voting for s to stick to the um infra red control instead of r. w. but we will discuss it later maybe
uh
components to use i'm not exactly sure what i will use for the design of the circuit
it depends uh on whether we will use the l. c. d. and mainly the speech recognition because the speech rec yeah
are we um are we planning to take an off the shelf an o. e. m. component for the radio wave circuit
or are we planning to construct our own circuit board
no no no no no
this we this we buy i think because it's rather cheap nowadays and it's not worth to construct ourselves
okay s
so we just buy a circuit board and okay
exactly
but i'm not sure about the circuit which is responsible for speech recognition
this i prefer that we should make ourselves
okay
but it depends whether we take a decision to use it
same thing
it's fairly expensive to use these circuits
so speech recognition well l. c. d. it's okay because it's common nowadays to use l. c. d. so i agree on using any kind of l. c. d.
less buttons good for me as a as a designer of the circuit
yeah
but the speech recognition we have to compare whether the price and the what does it offer you know
mm
yeah
so what do you think would be the price it would be out of range
yeah i'm
or it would be maybe feasible
oh
i was not thinking too much about the price
but if we use the l. c. d. uh even the radio frequency communication with the t. v. set and the backlight and uh related things like the photo diodes and stuff
it should be okay
if we decide to use the speech recognition then we probably could struggle but we'll see afterwards
okay
it depends of you if if the m. e. or u. i. d.
i'm sorry about the names i don't really know uh want to have it like in metal or in plastic
mm
these things
it it depends on you not because the the the electronic device's price is not not so big in comparison to to the overall shape and stuff like that
so
okay
we will discuss it afterwards
oh this is nothing
this is just my notes on what to use
and uh my personal preference is yes i would like also preferably to use r. w. circuit
but from the point of view uh of the design and price i would stick to i. r. s
that's my opinion
uh i mean if infra red uh circuit not not the radio frequency
why
because it's simpler
because because the the range where you can use it is fair
yeah
mm
it's okay i think
and the price is fairly cheap for this
okay
it's a a price matter
well depends
yeah
jus just the price
mm
otherwise i don't care what i put there because it's the chip which i buy or which we buy
okay
so i i i think it's o y o
what how much more expensive
are we talking three times more expensive
or ten times more expensive
well three to three to five
or
okay
n not ten times but it depends what what we
yeah yeah
that's still a lot
i think it's it's probably not worth spending the extra money
hmm
because i mean all the other remote controls on the market have infra red so people don't expect anything other than infra red
yeah
yeah
so it's not worth spending the extra money
yeah
well i oh
th they are used to use it when they can see the t. v. so i don't know
yeah
on the other side we want to have something new
you know where
yeah
we want to
to have something new and so we i think we should still thinking about it
but maybe
but i think based on my usability studies i th i feel that users are prioritise the look and the feel and the trendiness above
okay
you know the difference between infra red or radio waves
so i think we're better off spending money in the usability phase
you the user interface and management man uh
okay
mm
yeah
okay
uh okay that's it for me
okay thank you peter
'kay
so um i have to inform you i receive an email from the management bon board today and they have new requirements for the for the remote control
mm
um
first um they say that's uh about something about t teletext
uh apparently it becomes from according to them it becomes out of date
out dated
and uh
because of the internet popularity and everybody has internet at home and
actually it's not useful to have teletext
um
so i think we can avoid the teletext
um the second thing is uh
they suggest that that we should uh use the remote control only for t. v. not for d. v. d. and other devices
because it make it it makes it's too complex and uh because we have not much time for this project we should stay on t. v. on the only specific t. v. remote control
i agree
the third the third one is uh about the the the image of the company
so um uh we should we should keep uh the the product should be recognisable
uh uh
it's that mean we should use the colour of our company and maybe put somewhere the s the slogan of the company
which is uh we put fashion of in electronics
so when people see the the remote control they should say oh it's from real reaction and he s they should recognise the company
so um
so now we we should take the decision what we are going to what function we will have on this uh on this remote control
so mm are we going to use l. c. d. speech recognition
uh
well should we start with just the core the basic functions that we need
and then we can move on to the more advanced features
yeah
mm
yes
maybe maybe
okay so the available things are l. c. d. the buttons and everything
uh radio frequency depends
and well the recognition it depends on you guys
yeah but first maybe what is what are the usual function of a standard remote control
you should probably speak
i mean
okay
what do
okay well i mean the obvious one is changing channels
yeah
yeah
yeah
i think we should stick on very useful functions because we want less button
yeah
so yeah
yeah okay
so turning channel of course
volume setting
uh just one note to the chan channel changing
do we will we use only two buttons or or like numbered buttons
i mean those nine plus one or two
yeah
mm-hmm
i think it would be a b
because it's many buttons and we were speaking about lowering the number
mm
yeah
yeah i
on the other side we have more and more channels and if you want to pass through all the channels to get the channel you want it's
yeah
okay so so we keep all these all these buttons
yeah yeah at least nine ten button
maybe maybe we could think of something more betweens like
uh
like ten plus five plus one plus one minus or something
yeah
maybe something like that
or using the names and the keyboard i dunno
ah yeah
uh
or
maybe oh i don't know
or something
oh
maybe we could have key buttons like uh discovery channe like documentary channel and movies channel and
you mean like hierarchical structure
mm-hmm
and inside this this thing you can move maybe switch
okay
like categorising channels
if you want to see a movie you click on the movie button so you have all the movie channels and after you've you plus plus plus
mm-hmm
okay so s oh sorry
okay
i it just an idea
i don't know what you think about that but
so it requires the use of l. c. d. probably to to tell you
to have some feedback
yeah probably yeah yeah
okay so i'll make a note on l. c. d.
mm-hmm
yeah
we could maybe also c um incorporate petre's idea of the um slider for the volume with the channel
okay
okay
so we c you could quickly just through many channels
yeah
like roller for the yeah
for the channels perhaps
okay
anything else
so we've got channel and volume
um
yeah
so we are still s speaking about the common devices or we are inviting the new one
i think so
i think basically the core functions we want and then more advanced ones
yeah
what about the settings of the t. v.
because it's button we don't use very often but
it's we need it anyway
so uh we don't have any uh we don't have uh we should just design the remote control and we sh we don't have any access to the to the t. v. design or we can change some design
so
yeah
because one solution for this um uh uh ch changing channels is to see a summary of all channels
some some preview of all channels and then you can yeah
on the screen you mean
yeah b not on the control on the screen on the t. v. screen
not on the control but on the screen
well this would avoid l. c. d. then
i don't
and then
oh i don't but i don't think we're we're the ones
i mean this remote control we're developing is a generic control for all t. v. s i think
yeah yeah
mm-hmm
i don't know if it's possible to to watch something on t. v.
oh
w i i think it it would be better to to stick to the remote control and not to bother the t. v. to to to print these things
yeah
yeah
mm-hmm
well it wi it will be still more expensive but for the l. c. d. and this stuff is no problem in the price
mm-hmm
okay
so what are we doing with the settings
because settings if we want to do settings we need buttons for that and we want less buttons so
maybe with the l. c. d. we can do something with less buttons but
yeah
but then you don't want to make the l. c. d. display too complicated at the same time
mm
two t. v. s
i mean there's always we can always have these l less often used functions hidden somewhere under a cover or at the back of under a slide or some
yeah
oh yeah
like ma
oh the
we we could have for example two buttons like simple mode and advanced mode
or i dunno
yeah
or like children and grandfather's mode and the well the the user
yeah
mm
not the user the man mana t. v. manager mode
okay
ah i dunno
mm-hmm
so we have five minutes left
yeah
um
uh
so i think s the settings we th we are agreeing are agreed that they're required
yeah
mm-hmm
it's just how to a
yeah
we should hide them somewhere
hide them okay
yeah
in the menus of the l. c. d. or in the back of the remote control or something like that
okay
yeah
uh okay what else
um
i mean a power button's obviously
yes
uh required
this i was thinking
do we need a power button at all
should should shouldn't we do it like sleep mode after five minutes of not using it
because generally
it's it's a kind of setting i think
it should fit in those settings functions
mm
settings
because it's not a very current useful function
uh well i think when they say power button they mean to turn the t. v. on and off
no i think it's after after five minutes or something a timer i i think no
yes
well i i uh
but if you're watching t. v. for two hours you don't want your t. v. to turn off after five five minute
you don't need to every five minutes to keep it alive
uh probably
okay so we should keep this button
i mean based on our usability studies again um pe um people said that the power button was v a very relevant button
yeah
oh okay yeah
mm-hmm
um you know it was nine out of ten
okay so we we could p what we could probably do is to keep also to keep uh keep the l. c. d. and all the buttons and stuff
re relevance
we could make it like a opening opening style that if you open it you are you just turn on the t. v. and if you close it it will
yeah
yeah
turn off the t. v.
if if you like this
okay
b okay
because well it's maybe question for you t
i think we need to concentrate on the you know the major usage of the th of the control which is you sit down
mm-hmm
yeah
you turn on your t. v. you change channels you change the volume you turn the t. v. off
yeah
um and all the other f functionality is
so s yeah
yeah they can yeah they can be hide somewhere by a cover or something like this
not used very often
yeah
yeah
like covering cu
on the back or
yeah
i mean like the
yeah like mobile phone covering
yeah but since we have the l. c. d. we didn't need too much button too many buttons
um okay just um the decision of the power button
should we make it a button or some some something which would be
for what
uh power button
i think a button
a button is better
i think it should be a bu
ah oh yeah yeah
if it if it's a button or okay
yeah
yeah a button yeah i guess so
its own button on the front
mm
okay one nice big button
old fashioned button to satisfy the grandmothers
hmm
okay
so any other suggestions or functions
mm
s
what about things like the clock and um timers
do we still have the time
i i just wonder
yeah we have still one or two minutes to talk yeah
okay
oh
well what w what was the question
clock or
uh um you know some func some features on the control to display a time or t to display
usually it's already on t. v. or something like that
yes
yeah but since we want to control all the televisions
and and it would probably be worth to to set the timing on the remote no
yeah
because if if the t. v. turns on itself it well you know if the time the timer should be there
mm
yeah
yeah
if we if we add the time we have to have maybe a bigger display or something like that and is it very useful
i mean are users wants to have the time on the on the remote
mm
this is the question
probably not
is it useful
yes
it's a questi yeah it's a trade off
w in my opinion we should have only useful thing and because apparently they want the simpler it's is better
'kay
ah yeah
okay simple
did you did you ever use the like the timing of turning on the t. v. well and based on your
very yeah okay very occasionally
but i do use the i do use the display of the time quite often but
mm
yeah but it can be on the display in in a corner all the time on the remote
yeah
yeah that's okay that's true
okay so no time button
no time on
and uh do we need to include anything about the speech recognition and the speech commands or
okay
yes yes
i think
i i thin i think it will not take lots of place we just need a microphone and the software
so and it sh and it will be a little bit new and interesting
so people may be attracted to buy this stuff and it's not very difficult to uh put a software inside the the electronic device and put a microphone
it doesn't take that much place and also that much it doesn't cost that much
yeah
yeah but we we should be careful about the battery life then
so maybe we think we can think more about that and discuss that maybe last time next time
if we use the speech recognition
mm-hmm
yeah
and uh yeah now the meeting room is busy
somebody booked the meeting room just for at one p. m. and so we should leave
uh
so um
so now we are going for for a small lunch
it's uh funded by the company
and uh after we have uh thirteen minutes to to do indevel individual works
and uh i will do the minutes
and uh
you are going to work on your individual works
and uh you will receive as usual your specific instruction and so on
okay cool
thank you everybody
okay
thanks
thank you
hello uh this meeting we are it's fo should be focused on the conceptual design of the remote control
hello
mm-hmm
hello
um the goal of this meeting is to reach a decision at the end on the concept and i think the last time we talked about an a lot and we had a rough idea of what is going to be
but uh in th at the end of this meeting we have to to reach a decision
so uh
we will have again three presentation from all of you and uh i hope it will be fast because i would like to have time to
for long discussion and
and decisions
so who wants to start
i s
okay
okay
no no you you can start
okay i'll start
so start uh
can you open my presentation please
uh
i'm number four
trend
this one
yep
can you pass the mouse please
oh okay that's fine
turn
okay
um so basically i just want to presented to you present to you some recent results we've had from um looking at uh um some remote control market research and some fashion trends around the world
um
the fashion trends we got from talking to our our contacts in the fashion industry based in paris and milan
um so f from our market research basically we've come to the conclusion that a fancy look and feel
um as opposed to a functional look and feel is our number one priority
um fancy is is is is the you know highest priority
hmm
hmm
secondly um that our remote control needs to be techn technologically innovative
um so this is t number two priority but it's two times less important as the fancy criteria
um and third thirdly the easiness of use is is the um is is important as well
but again two times less important as the technologically innovativeness of the remote control
from our f fashion people in paris and milan
um we've discovered that this year um fruit the fruit and vegetable motif will be the most important thing in in clothes shoes and furniture
so i'm pretty confident that our remote control fits into the furniture category
and also um the feel of material this year um is expected to be spongy
okay
um so hopefully our remote control reflects that s in some way
what does it mean spongy
uh sort of um squishy
um
like soft or something
yeah soft like a uh like a sponge
like a sponge
i don't know
yeah
okay
yeah
i will see
um so in conclusion we need a our remote control needs to be something that's really fancy um has lots of technolog tech technology in it
um somehow would be good to have it related to fruit and vegetables with a spongy feel
okay
and that it's easy to use and from our last meeting our you know fabian told us that w you know one of the requirements is that we have to reflect the look and feel of our of th the real reaction company
um
yeah uh yeah
that's it
easy to use is it uh
a as much as important than technology or fancy thing
it's less important right
less important
so um fanciness first and then two ti you know half as important as that is technology technology and half important as technology is easy to use
yeah yeah
okay
so
so hamed can you
yeah
the second one
could you please show the presentation number three
mm-hmm
i think the biggest struggle will be the easy to use feature
um
we'll see
yeah
number
three
three
this one
yes
just could you please check if it is the first one or the second
uh n n no it's the first one
the second one
so it's not this one
uh yeah
okay
okay
so i am going to talk about a little bit about how this remote control should be appear to be more easy to use
i think uh i think the feature easy to use is more important than being fancy but okay we can discuss about it uh later
um generally generally uh this remote control uh uh should be should be something
in my opinion uh the first feature is just to be easy to use
so the more frequent buttons should be larger they should be placed in a good position uh uh inside the remote control
and uh s uh i can conclude like this that we shouldn't need to learn how to use it
it should be we shouldn't need to es open a a t book and uh start reading and uh learning how to use this uh this uh remote control
okay
so what i found out that uh as i said uh i think it's better to put uh more frequent uh uh uh ke uh buttons which are used more in the middle of the remote control
and they should be bigger in size
uh the shape of remote control should be in a way which can which should be taken easily in hand
it should not be completely like uh a cube
it should be it should have round edge so uh then it's easier
exactly
and maybe uh just like some toys some joystick which is easier to take inside the hand
and uh also f uh uh m because because customers doesn't like to buy lots of battery it should not uh consume lots of energy
okay
and my personal p uh preference is uh as i said
uh just putting this buttons in a special places and covered some buttons which are not used uh that much like settings button like mobile phone
usually some mobile phone cover the dialling number part
so we can cover these buttons which are not used or uh number buttons for the for the for the can channels
and just put uh volume change or s ch can uh channel change buttons uh uh in the remote control
and if the user needed to do some more complex task uh he he can open the cover and then change settings or something like this
uh
and also uh i think if we put some some some some some buttons inside of the remote control it can be used easier
not on remote control
i dunno if i can explain well
but uh just inside
for example a sliding or rolling uh uh d uh stuff if we put it inside then we can easily manipulate with uh thumb
so it can be another uh preference
and uh i dunno but uh i think usage of a speech recogn uh r recogniser can be good
i know that it consumes lots of energy
but if we do it in some way that it asleeps when there is no sound and when it detects some sound it may consume less energy
and i think it's good because it's something new and usually young people like something new
so it may not be very useful but because it's new people may buy it
uh i personally think there should be a big difference between uh between something
otherwise they prefer to buy something which is coming from a famous company or
okay
that's mine
okay
uh okay so good news from me uh uh for me from hamed but bad news from bob obviously
because spongy design i don't like it as okay so could you please fabien open it
yeah
i'm person two
and which one uh probably the first one
i'm not sure but check the first one
i most of the things i have to write myself on the board but yeah that's it
this one yeah
just
it's only this slide
yeah
this this is just uh one thing i wanted to mention and show you that i just uh i just found this
that our company uh developed a s a seven f seven fingers or i'll just yeah
inch
seven seven inch t. t. f. t. screen which is good news for us since we wanted to include a display there
uh so i i probably draw it down raw scheme
oh
this is this is the stuff that i can use to okay
oops
so the this will be like the overall scheme or overall requirements from the engineering point of view
uh first thing is uh this will be the overall shape
no uh i'm not speaking about the real shape of the device but the shape of the inside of the device
so there will be some circuit uh for the power
so say power circuit here
uh the main energy will be taken from batteries that we can uh uh and if we decide to use the speech recognition stuff there
we must use additional source of energy which i found the best is to use the solar cells which can which can uh supply everything
i was computing all the all the things related to the speech recognition and it's okay to use just uh two batteries and solar cells so
so no problem
there can be also solar cell
uh the main board with all the circuits will take at least seven to seven centimetres so this is my like hard requirement for the guys from the design
so at least seven to seven
mm-hmm
it depends where you put your screen because the screen is uh seven inch so it depends on you where where you put it
it doesn't matter
um it's just one cord from from the main board to the screen which can be elsewhere
so this will be t. f. t.
and on the main board we have the um interface to the microphone which is somewhere
say here
interface to the microphone
then the graphical card uh for the t. f. t. and the third unit is the i. r.
the good news is that we can uh we decided to use the infra red unit because our company has also developed the chip for communication by the infra red
including all the stuff inside so it will be very cheap for us
so infra red here
so the once again the overall requirements seven to seven centimetres for the board
which has to be which can be spongy but has to be this size and the t. f. t. which is seven inches
um i have to check what i wanted to
uh from my point of view i don't care about the about the material used for the overall des uh ov all the device
can you fit any uh for example a t. f. t. or any electronic device in a spongy thing or is there any problem for that
for example put electronic card on a spongy thing i can i can imagine it could be a problem
a all these things in in uh in this box are okay to put in in any shape basically
but we have to take care of the t. f. t.
yep
well sponginess
maybe it a good feature since it takes if it's around the t. f. t. then it's good because it's just keeps it safe i dunno
okay
so
well maybe it can have two shells a hard shell inside and a spongy shell outside
so
okay
maybe put electronic in a box and a spongy thing around
well it's maybe related to the u. i.
maybe after
so
yeah
ca
can i ask a question
a yeah that's all from me
this seven inch t. f. t. screen how big is it in reality
yeah
well seven to seven inches
so like that
yes
that's quite big
uh uh have we decided that we're gonna use this t. f. t. screen
yeah but
no i don't think it's seven by seven i think it's seven the diagonal is seven
to be honest i was
usually when they say seven inch i think it's the diagonal
but i mean even even that is like this big
yeah yes
yeah
i dunno i dun i dun one each
but yeah
yeah honestly speaking i was thinking that it was seven centimetres initially but it's seven inches
yeah
but i i think we can we can cut it
you can cut the t. f. t. screen
let's go
yeah no no problem because because because then the size of the graphic card will be one fourth
so let's cut the t. f. t.
so
yeah but no problem to to me to cut the screen
mm
okay so
so so for the same price we have four screens now
mm
okay
these technical engineers huh
so what's the size of the device
ah well this is like this is almost nothing
seven to seven to at least well some three millimetres or something
even from my perspective seven t seven centimetres by seven centimetres is still
yeah but we wanted the big buttons and stuff like that you know
is it can you hold that or
because if it's t too small we can we can lose it at home you know
what user wants
he wants a small remote control or
uh
yeah a small c control that they can hold in hand
uh uh with big buttons
i thought that it it should fit in the hand or something
yes
it's difficult
a sm
but is something that's seven centimetres square e easy to hold
w i i think so
i if the roller buttons are on the side you don't have to catch it like that but just like this and you know follow follow well
that's that's no task for me but well seven to seven at least yeah but
so maybe you can finish your presentation and afterwards we will discuss about all this
maybe this
oh okay
okay
okay thanks
that's it
okay
so
no
uh so i think we have a lot we have to take decision today
so i think we have to do some work to finalise our idea and take decisions
uh first i think energy it's a key problem because uh it depend what can we have as feature if we use only batteries
for example or something like that
because can we have l. c. d. and speech recognition with battery and it's also r related to the size of the of the devi of the device
not
j uh just a point to the energy th things
if we use the batteries and the additional so solar cell
then it's okay for l. uh speech recognition and l. c. d. so no problem in energy i think
okay
so okay
but we have to use the solar cell
so but
otherwise not
uh like but using how many batteries for example
are are what maybe what is the size of the battery
yeah i was thinking just common a. a. cells
okay
uh one two
so like three to five centimetres i dunno exactly but
okay
so if we use s solar cells um where is the sun if someone's watching t. v. inside
s
uh d doesn't need to be sun
it it's just the daylight you know
okay
the television lights
yeah well i i suppose that i suppose that uh that this remote control won't be in the in the room like this
where there is light only when when there are people but
mm-hmm
at least when there is t. v. you can get light from the t. v.
yeah from the t. i don't think it's enough uh
yeah
i dunno
okay
okay
mm
ah it's a it's a compromise no
at least it's new and maybe technology new technology
yeah that's why i wanted to to include the speech recognition because you wanted all the new things
it's it's quite innovative yes
yeah
hmm
um
and if you watch t. v. outside it's very useful
so i think before talking about the other thing it's important thing it's the case
uh what what are gonna be the size because its weight drives the other what we are going to use as features and so on
for example for the for the l. c. d. if we choose to have a small device we cannot use this um a such a a a screen
uh the s the screen is okay but the board uh that's the problem
well what what would you guess as a shape
or what what would be the shape
mm
i think i think their being uh large or small is not important
the only important thing is to be able to take it in uh inside hand easily
so let's say an average size okay and it should not be very heavy also
mm
and i prefer to is it shouldn't have a uniform shape so in the middle it should be a little bit thinner maybe maybe
so we c it's like like some joysticks
you can take uh some some joystick you can take inside hand easier because it's it's designed for your f uh taking into account your finger shape and your palm shape
so the general shape should be like this
i think uh seven centimetre by seven centimetre is a little bit large
so uh seven not seven but let's say five by ten it's i think it's that's my opinion
okay
which is the same area
it's easier
okay
yeah
could you re could you redesign your board
five to ten
oh five five centimetres by ten centimetres
well that
yeah right
yeah
yeah i think it's feasib well one um um how could we do it
we could put the board next to well
under the l. c. d. and for example make the l. c. d. be totally unrelated to the thing that you hold in your hand
mm-hmm
like holding something and the l. c. d. to be just on top of it you know somehow
well but maybe let's stick to the s spongy thing like one unit
oh
i've i s i think the easiest thing would be to to have a smaller l. c. d. if it's possible
well fi five to ten it would be feasible
mm
okay so five to ten i i think it's it's feasible
okay
so we are agree with a small
i'll make it
or uh or i don't know but i don't want to now invent something new because we didn't discuss about it
fo five by ten
l. c. d.
so using some l. c. d. s we can touch so we can remove uh keys and just uh having uh i dunno the name l. c. d. responding to fingers
yeah
touching the screen
something like mm like tactile
tactile or something yeah
mm touch screen
touch screen yeah
so but for now if we don't want to use such kind of screens i i think we using a a smaller screen is better because
yeah
the problem is we have a limit in a month of time so we cannot do something very new
mm-hmm
so let's go for a small l. c. d.
so
okay so
yeah so so just just give me the the the five by ten numbers that you find the best and send it me and i will work it out
a smaller s
yeah okay
okay
so five by s ten
hmm
um so what about so the case we talked about
um something easy to use you said something easy to use but how does that fit in a fashion way like with fruit and vegetable
and about the colour and logo of the of the company and so on now can we do that
my first idea is because
our colour is more yellow and the it should be easy to take in a hand
i thought about banana or something like that which is fruits and
seven to ten banana
a big banana
okay
rather mango or something or
um
well it's it's definitely the obvious choice with the colour of our company
yeah
i mean what other what other fruit and vegetables do you know of any any other fruit and vegetables that are yellow
yeah
but it's just an idea
i dunno what you think about but
yeah
i dunno if it can fit with the technology
you are the specialists of that
you mean banana
well but
if it's if it if the banana is big enough
so
then yes
but if you want to look at the screen no
well
yeah and
i think this is not good
the screen has to be square
or it can be like a a shape quite uh with curves
well it can be whatever you want
but if it's square then we get four screens out of one by cutting just
it could
but if you want some shape then we can only get like two screens out of seven to seven inches so
yeah
mm
it's like more more expensive to have shape like that
but i don't care
you know if we fit this requirement
well
i'd like a shaped screen
i think that's more important than saving a bit of money on on the t. f. t. screen
okay
okay okay
mm
yeah m maybe the banana could be like a bit uh fatter than than the c c common one
yeah
yeah it should remember banana but it's not doesn't have to b to be uh uh really the size and exactly the shape of a banana
but
like modified banana okay
well it we'll stick to banana or
so we are agree with the banana thing
okay
yeah banana's good
okay
okay
okay
mm mm
so the last point we decided it's infra red i guess
yeah i think infra red
yeah yeah
everybody's agreed
sure
uh so that's it i think about the concepts
you have other thing to add to this point or uh no
so uh about the user interface so we are going to use l. c. d.
in the last meeting we talked about uh hidden buttons
i don't know what we are going to do with that
you talked about the buttons on the side
like like peeling of the banana you s
yeah peeling of the banana
it would be cool yeah
mm what
peeling of the banana you know should should discover the other buttons which are hidden
yeah
yeah
mm
okay
and you mean the first layer would be spongy
yeah
first layer obviously spo yeah w it's it's like silly but the people will really appreciate it yeah i think
so is it is it possible to do that
it would be a great idea but is it possible technically
uh
like doing a spongy layer of the banana and you open it
i think if we if we have a spongy layer on the outside of the banana then it's easy to make that
yeah
you know to manipulate that to hav be a cover that you can pull off and
mm-hmm
yeah
yeah some
yeah
something like a plastic cover covering uh some interface u. s. b. interface as in the in uh digital camera
if you see it's like peeling
you open a plastic cover and you see some u. s. b. interfaces some some interfaces for adaptor
so keys can be uh buttons can be covered like this
with a plastic cover and uh when uh and when you open this cover it's like peeling a banana
so something like this
yeah but do you see that as a
rigid thing or like like a banana something very soft you can open like banana or
well is it possible to make it soft
yeah yeah yeah it's a lic like a plastic cover so
yeah
so i think if it's so then it's cool
so i dunno what you think bob but it would be great for users i think and very good for marketing
i think for sure
definitely
the softer the better
yeah
cool
yeah
honestly speaking i cannot imagine it so far but it will be terrible
yeah
um
mm
and setting buttons
hidden in
mm other remarks or something or
something we didn't talk about yes yet or
i think
we are almost there
uh maybe how can we if we have a soft thing
like this and to open it we have to attach it somewhere i dunno how to do that technically or
mm-hmm
and how
pof
we could use velcro
yeah maybe
or uh ma maybe a magnetic
yes yeah it's a good idea
thing
magnetic
ma magnetic oh
mm
yeah or a yeah it can is it can be a plastic cover uh sticking to the to the all the stuff like uh with magnetic p uh magnetic uh magnetic uh materials in the border
so it's it sticks like refrigerator door completely
okay
and when you try to open it it will be opened easily
so you you can be sure that it will not be open while you're uh while while uh you are commonly using uh buttons on the banana
okay
and what would be the matter here of the first layer i mean
mm
likes
soft plastic or
yeah i imagine some sort of vinyl thing
yeah yeah yeah
in a in a sort of a with a suede sort of feel
maybe
well since since the since the things like the like the screen and um how to say that solar cell has to be has to be like kept
kept in the shape we cannot b uh so we need that the that the peeling
uh
i dunno but we should we should take care of these two two things
so if if uh the solar cell won't be visible while the banana is closed
then the material must be able to put the light inside you know
so that we can reach the energy out of it out of that
mm
mm
so you're saying is it possible to have a solar cell and this removable cover and
it is possible but well if it
and a and a banana
mm
i dunno
i dunno how to how to do it if if t if to if it's better to put the solar cell to the t to the peeling or outside it
hmm
yeah
or or inside
but then it must be some window there you know
okay
mm
and something we forgot maybe uh about the speech recognition system are we going to use it or not
yes i think
i think it's important
i think so
it i yeah it seems feasible and it would be something very great
i think one of our p priorities is tech technology
mm
and
so we have the de design the a good shape new and so on and we have also the technology thing w will be
mm-hmm
mm-hmm
and even the easy to use thing so it will be perfect
mm
mm
so we add also the speech recognition device
yeah
yeah
i agree
so that great
we have decided everything
and think we are on a good way
so um
uh the next meeting will start in thirty minutes
um so uh the the industrial manager uh will uh will work on the look and feel design
the user interface uh uh mana uh manager will work on the user interface device
and the the marketing expert will do the first project evaluation
okay
so i hope you can do that in thirty minutes
and uh yeah i
uh i think you should work together s you uh hamed and peter to work uh in a in a first prototype and uh
more about the shape and so on and how you can manage to put everything together
and um as usual you will receive some specific instructions on
so thank you all everybody and see you in thirty minutes
okay
okay
thank you
okay
thank you
oops
so hello everyone
we're here to have a kick off meeting for the design of a f for the beginning of new project um uh remote control for the design for a new remote control
i'm the project manager christa pavlov and okay let's begin
so
i'm first going to do an opening then we get used to one anothers and we speak about this tool we're going to design and try to make a project plan
some discussion and then we talk of uh the next meeting
so um we want to to do a new remote control
it has to be original trendy and user friendly
um i think the important points we have to t talk about are uh it's functional design it's conceptual design and desail detailed design
and for that we're going um all to work individually and then have meeting during the whole day
um so let's try the whiteboard
wow
um so any of you who want to go
yeah for favourite animals
it's gonna be not my favourite one but the one i can draw
and it's gonna be you'll try to guess
wow
complex
wow
huh
a cat
no
no
no
darn
uh
a rabbit
yes that's a rabbit
a what
that's my favourite one
a rabbit
a r a rabbit oh oh yeah where is the carrot
rabbit
that's it
okay mm-hmm
you want to go
i am not very good at uh this kind of stuff
hmm
my favourite animal is
you wa
wow
a human ah
guess
a human yay
it's a very complex animal and um yeah
no
characteristics of this this animal is dangerous
mm i think you're supposed to yeah
is the white okay
hmm
i guess you can
wow
that's cobra
ah a kind of uh snake
cobra
exactly
yeah uh not really
small cobra
no it just small cobra yeah
uh-huh
is that a worm
it's co c quite recognisable
or
what about you uh christa
uh yeah christa pavlov mm
chris
christa christa
a fish
mm
hmm
smiling fish
smile fish
okay
a smiling fish
mm-hmm
mm-hmm
so w whiteboard is working
yeah
yeah
good
next
next
let's talk about money
just tr try to guess who is a user interface designer
yeah well
according to the drawings
yeah you're
not me
okay
so
so
twenty five euro for a remote control
yeah mm that's the price we want to that's the aim for the price for the remote control
hmm
okay
we aim to do this profit
'tis big number
on the international market
yeah
mm-hmm
yeah we're to sell two million then
wow
mm-hmm
mm for a production cost of mm twelve fifty euros maximum
'kay
so any of you have experience in remote controls
uh yes we have plenty at home
mm yeah
in fact my daughter likes l remote controls
that
mm
to eat
to eat
yeah mainly and to break
so that could be a great um application
remote controls children proof
mm-hmm
mm mm-hmm
yeah
ye ye yeah
children proof
hmm
so she likes uh buttons which make click so it has to click
okay
yeah pret
so they have to be waterproof maybe
it has to be uh wha baby proof yeah but mainly it has to be very robust because even if she's not very tall she's uh high enough so that uh when she throw it away it's uh
'cause they eat she ate it
mm-hmm
yeah
ah
so it has to be very robust
okay unbreakable
unbreakable yeah
uh-huh
yeah we have some child lock or something yeah
mm-hmm
mm-hmm
and uh
it has to be nice looking
yeah
colourful maybe
colourful yeah mm
colourful
that's not practical
colourful because uh nobody has colourful remote control they're always black yeah but this one could be i dunno purple or b
yeah
no that's a good idea
yeah it's always black or yeah
mm mm mm
no
but how gonna okay just uh but it's uh monochrome it's n it's not like
yeah
yeah
yeah yeah
no because you think why not
yeah
one colour
otherwise you will never find it
yeah
yeah yeah
yeah even we can change colours no
like the uh like the phones and these things we c yeah
oh like the phones yeah it could change colours yeah
cool
mm-hmm
at least for children like one colour and
ch
yeah
good
good idea
and it should be really small and
small also
don't you think
huh not so big like yeah
no uh not too much buttons or mm
yeah not too much buttons and
should it be
y you know these uh remote controls where um they are what they call a universal ret remote control so y you can decide that now it's the remote control for the television
mm-hmm
then it's the remote control for the the sound system or for your refrigerator whatever i dunno if it's
uh
yeah
yeah that's
or if we should have a targeted re remote control
okay
so colour robustness easy to use size yeah size matters yeah
so i think there's
yeah
colour size sh
so you you think it's better if small
than bigger
yeah maybe at least n not bigger than this i guess
mm
yeah but without any extremes like n not of this size not too large
no not too small yeah
yeah yeah at least it should hold in your hand n properly like
okay
yeah
hmm
yeah like a palm sized
yeah
mm
just to hold it
okay
but uh what would be different from this from the others
i dunno if
uh maybe we can change the colours that at least the frame
yeah at least the colour would be different
mm
s so then it depends you are to
mm
mm i mean you c you can easily remove the frame
i think one thing important for instance in this remote control if you remember when people use it they're they never find a good button in the right place
yeah yeah
mm-hmm
for some reason they they they click the off button when they want to use the
yeah
yeah
so there's a problem in the design of that kind of remote control somehow i dunno
mm
so some kind of idea uh with um um cellular phone with a a screen that will tell you what no
no no screens it's too complex
okay
too expensive for twelve euro
mm
too expensive yeah
and n maybe not too expensive well it's not my problem but well okay
and too expensive
ah
but no screens on remote controls
mm-hmm
mm
i thought it could be only a screen which would change depending on uh uh the use or even the user
so ma i prefer to have the off button at the top right
mm-hmm
ye yeah
so i would have my own design of the remote control because it's in fact just a a full touch screen remote control if you if you like
hmm
i mean it it's like it's like two types no
i don't know if it makes sense but
mm mm
people are right handed or left handed so y because i am left handed i use like this
yeah for instance mm
say if you're right handed you use like this or so tha your switch on and off should be on yeah
mm-hmm mm-hmm
mm-hmm
mm
mm mm mm
so adaptable yeah something yeah
adaptable
maybe if if it's possible yeah
alright good so how many actions do we need to implement in it
mm huh
maybe i think even we can keep two switches and then we can uh only make one working
on off
yeah
we can adapt only one switch suppose here like we can make two switches and if i'm left hander i use this switch to follow the main operations
i mean if it's less than three uh then we can make it uh like a
two
three buttons you mean
like three mental states yeah you know what i mean we can just make it uh
three option
ah
yeah
yeah
um
controlled by a brain huh
mm-hmm
mm-hmm yeah sure
maybe if it's more if there is a software inside that ask you three
mm-hmm
hmm
if it if we want a r universal remote control that we sa like we say before it may
may need more than three mm three button three mm possibilities ye yeah
sh sure sure
yeah more than three actions that you may want to do at a given time
mm yeah
yeah
but for standard actions you usually what do you do you change channels you adjust volume and nothing else
yeah but for instance when you change channels you can have you can just go to the next one or go to channel twenty five
mm
yeah
mm
and that's already more complex to go to channel twenty five
mm-hmm
you do this
yeah
uh no
i usually just change channels
because i'm only using three or four channels but
yeah
but they keep generally their t slash slash uh this thing and then the dash dash and then you can put yeah you can only have one bit
yeah
i change channel like this m uh i want to go to twenty five and then to ten uh-huh mm yeah
dash
and then back to the one i was before so there's whichever it was
also we can be here yeah that would be cool
uh-huh
yeah you can yeah
go back button is good
yeah
yeah
uh uh we had that in in other countries
i once had it
yeah yeah the previous button is
mm yeah
yeah e even the history so you could like uh undo previous of the previous
mm-hmm
uh okay
history
oh uh
then you can watch what your ah you could also record your record your sequence of actions
uh
yeah
that becomes more complex but you could look at what uh the other people have used there or remote controls
yeah yeah what the which channels the viewer
mm mm
yeah maybe it's a
okay
so i think we have full of idea
okay
um we're going to meet again in thirty minutes and uh i want you to mm
work on these ideas and try to make a
uh the ones make um to decide what what are the ones important and what are the one that we don't want
and um m maybe more in the technical parts what uh do we want to do
um
so um your personal coach will send you some instruction for for this thirty minutes
so what does m. e. means
m. e. the user requirements
or that's uh that's for us
market expert
marketing yeah
mm
uh that's me
oh of course yeah the user requirement specifications uh-huh yeah
mm-hmm
okay
mm okay
i'll think of that
so
so
i think that's all
meeting's over
great
yeah
okay
thank you
thank you
thank you everybody
see you in thirty minutes
so
so
i hope you're ready for this uh functional design meeting
of course
um so i will take the minutes you mm you three are going to do presentation
um uh we want to know to at the end to know the new project's requirement so we need uh to know the the user uh needs that we want to fulfil to fulfil the from the technical part we want to know how it going to work and um
third part uh i don't remember which is not very good
ah of course how to to design this uh this yeah
nice stuff
so
um let's go for the three presentations so first um marketing expert
who starts
oh
ha
okay
so wait a minute
so i dunno if i can do that like this
mm
yeah
so it's being modified
do you want yeah open
read only
i hope i saved it
so um yeah this is my name
sammy benjo
i know this name uh
sounds uh
we met before
so as you know you i think you already know me sammy benjo
i am the expert in marketing and i want to tell you about what people uh s want and uh like and dislike in remote controls
and i hope this is going to help you to to design it correctly
so next please
uh oh
mm uh
yeah it is put f. five
hmm
hmm
the full page presentation yep
yeah maybe in the full page because i i spent lots of time doing this presentation so
f. f. five
okay
yeah
yep
f. five
yeah
uh-huh hmm okay
mm-hmm
mm
so basically uh what i suggest is that uh instead of deciding ourself what what could be and what should be a good uh remote control
let's ask people who are users of remote controls how they feel about w the current remote controls what they like
what they don't like and um and what they do with them by the way because they are supposed to be useful
don't forget about that
so we've we've conducted a a survey on on the use of uh remote controls and i'd like to show you some of the results we found on this survey
and next please
yeah so basically what we found was that uh there are several things that the user don't like in remote controls
first of all they find it very ugly
current remote controls as you know they're the same as this one uh they're not nice colour
not nice shape i mean they're all the same and they're not l good looking
um what is interesting is that in fact it seems that they were people are ready to pay for nice and look and fancy looking uh remote control
so i think we should probably spend lots of time in and effort in that um
and the other thing is that uh the the current remote controls are not so easy to use and it it the the current uh facilities that they offer do not match what people really want to use their remote controls
for instance uh we see that uh they zap very often so i think this is a very uh important uh functionality that it should be easy for them to to zap uh in one way or another
and most of the buttons uh on uh current remote controls are not used
so i think we should design something where some of the buttons which are those that are used should be easier to see and use than others that only a couple of people are using
um next please
now people are very frustrated w with their remote controls and they for instance uh they don't even find it it's it's often lost somewhere in the in the in your home and nobody knows where it is
yeah
maybe if we have something where we could ask the remote control please where are you
agree
yeah
yeah
like uh something to to like t i think phones
some of the phones have some of this kind of s functionality
uh of course phone you can always phone your phone but you can't phone your your remote control
you can you are
why not
but why not
yeah
and because of the fact that there are so many buttons in these remote controls that nobody use in fact they don't even know how to use them
hmm
so most of the the people say they they don't know how to they to use properly their r remote controls
and uh they are bad for r. s. i. but uh i don't remember what is r. s. i.
okay uh tha that's look great
so i think they are bad
r. s. i. mm-hmm
mm-hmm
mm nobody has any idea about that
well i'll check uh with my
yeah it's electromagnetic waves or something kind of maybe uh effect
oh okay i think it's a technical thing which our
no i don't think so
yeah because infrared uses some electromagnetic technology and those waves have high
okay
mm-hmm
okay
okay
so it seems that it's a lot of people for a concept that we don't know but we have to take this into account
but twenty six percent do you know
or something we don't know
uh
twenty five
uh
every fourth you know
mm-hmm
yeah it's
every four some of us knows
people really
okay
so anyway that's for what the biggest frustration uh of the user and um
one of us
yeah
yeah
what else do i have
next slide
ah yeah
mm-hmm
so we've listed a couple of uh
functions
s uh functions that may be uh used by u the user in the current uh available uh remote controls and uh well the tables look very nice to read but what is important is to understand that the power button is not used often because in general you use it only once per session
but it is very relevant
people want to have a power button
channel selection is uh o often used very often used and indeed uh very relevant
ah now i remember what is r. s. i. it's repetitivity stress injury
we have to be careful with that word but uh anyway i continue my presentation so yeah channel selection is um very important very often used
uh
volume is not often used but people uh want to have control on volume and that makes sense of course
and n then you have things which are very much less often used like the settings
audio settings screen settings even teletext and channel settings
all of them
they're not often used and they are s more or less relevant
it seems that people find teletext teletext uh relevant even if i personally never use it but seems that it's average relevant at least so
i have been told that we uh don't consider teletext that it's out of date now because of internet
i can tell you that uh in a l in a scale between one and ten relevant uh not relevant to relevant people scored a six on this
which is not as uh these these two one were had i think ten i think
mm-hmm
but but if you compare with these ones uh i think they scored a one or two
not very relevant so
hmm
if if there are good reason not to put teletext it's okay but just know that people find it somehow relevant
mm-hmm
mm-hmm
that's for the main functions i think and uh then we can ask uh ourself uh what people don't have that may be useful
for instance i think net next slide
one of the thing the trend uh that uh you are probably aware of is the possibility the eventual possibility of having speech recognition in your remote control
so you wouldn't have to tap tap in your buttons but just tell your remote control or whatever you need you have what you want
so we've conducted a survey about uh whether people would like or not to have uh this kind of uh functionality in their remote control and as we can see it really depends on the age
young people probably because it's a buzz word find it very relevant
and uh as the age goes up the the relevance goes down
yeah
so now it really depends on the kind of uh targeting uh wha who are we targeting with this remote control
i think if we are targeting young people then uh it's probably something we have to consider
'cause
if we are targeting you very old people this is something they really don't know why they this should be so now this is of course depends on that
mm mm
okay
and um i don't have any conclusion i didn't have time the meeting was very tight so that's basically my findings
and uh if you have any question
mm i think it's good okay
you done a good review
i got one question uh you are a market expert so should we aim at the young people or not
i can go back
thank you
yeah one question yeah
i am
i think we should aim at the young people
but uh i think they are they are those uh who might be more interested in a in a new device
mm
in general the the early adopters of a new device are young people less than more than
okay then teletext is used less
mm
mm-hmm
then teletext is useless for them i think yeah
okay
because they they have other means of finding their information
mm-hmm
mm-hmm mm mm
mm-hmm
yeah
okay
but yeah
that's good point
mm yep
mm
okay
nope
'kay
okay
thank you
so um now i think it's the turn of the
the i'm not sure um
of the technical function so
uh
so i think it's you huh
uh it's
no
that's me
techni function of
what effect
no user requiremen
yeah
okay
wait a second
i have to do working design so uh
argh
so you're
that's but this but number three yes
mm-hmm
so my name is mark dwight and um i am responsible for user interface design
however uh mm project manager asked me to give you some presentation about technical functions design
uh as i'm a more an artist that's gonna be less technical functions but more user interface and current intentions and everything which is linked with this
so next slide please
okay
let's go
and uh a general method which is seems to be very useful for our task is not to forget about uh occam razor
mm
we should never complicate things too much
we should only make a remote control nothing more
nothing more than this just a remote control
'cause current remote controls they are never easy enough to use
makes sense
so make a click please
so here is this remote control
it's quite a standard one but it's not from a t. v. it's from a much
easier device like air conditioning or something
but you know we can use it for a t. v. easily
only buttons we need is on off volume channels and maybe some options or something else and please make a click compared to this one
it's
which one would you prefer
i guess this
yeah yeah
i would say the simplest one as long as there are the uh i find the buttons that i need every time i need a button
sure sure
yeah
maybe it can be yeah middle of like between those two li
yeah and our method is going to be provide simple
oh sorry
simple desires into simple actions
nice
nice sentence
findings
okay
oh sorry
our question of the style we should remember that our company
puts fashion into electronics
and we should never forget about it
concept
s you should yeah
be simple
be simple and you'll lean on this market
market is a of remote controls you know it better it's very
mm
well it's
it's not an easy field to to play you know
so be simple
for personal preferences i think that to make a baby proof remote control it got to be a titanium
it's a really good style it going to be look like like this
it is unbreakable and it is very universal
w we'll have a screen with a back light which can change colours
mm-hmm
and we can put all the options into this screen
we'll need only few buttons
all the other things can be controlled through the screen
and all these buttons should be easy to find and to click 'cause when you watch a movie and you want to change something
you always try to find a good button and click it but you should do it by touching it and finding it easily just by touch
so
press
i would propose this concept for design just few buttons a screen with a back light which can change colours titanium
mm
i think and uh what else
i got just very few and good ideas
we need power and volume
and let us include two nice features into this device first power on and off can be made fully automatic
when you go to the sofa take your control and point it to the t. v.
it's off
hmm
it's on
the t. v. turns on
and when does it turn off
when you don't touch the control but you go out of the
oh so you have a
for for enough time like uh you
sensing sensor machine that uh knows
it's a question to our technical design our two engineers
tech
and another nice feature that i would like to implement is uh volume control
suppose you set u you set up some volume and then you move out or you move to the other corner of the room and take your control with you
like you want to to change the chair or you want to move to the armchair from the sofa or something and then the volume changes
or you want to go to the kitchen
mm-hmm
it's easy to do you just control the
according to your distance to and the angle maybe if you have a stereo system
distance
according to the distance
yeah yeah yeah
uh i'm not sure about the screen wha what is the use usefulness of the screen
so
uh is it a touch screen by the way
i think it can be just a menu which can be controlled with a left right up down and enter
so it gives instructions but uh it has to be with an back light somehow
yeah
so its main purpose in fact is a back light which change colours which makes it easier to find
mm-hmm
okay
and each can it can respond for your voice like it can turn on the light for you just to f find it easily yeah
okay
mm
so basically that's it
um i see that you target uh several s application not only t. v. but i like we talk about um universal uh remote control
can be easily done 'cause
yeah
you got simple designs y we should put it to simple actions
hmm
let it be universal so you want to use it for your hi fi system
you want to change tracks and you want to adjust volume
mm-hmm
just few actions a few actions for everything
mm
hmm
s
all the rest we sh we'll put it into this menu on the screen
mm
since we were targeting a really soon uh uh date for the the the um i issuing of this uh remote control i think we will only concentrate on t. v. for the moment and then maybe m make it more generalised yeah
mm
okay okay
yeah and it mm
okay but it's quite universal you know
mm
we can just extend it to any device
mm
so for instance if i want to go to directly to channel twenty five how would i do can i do that with this
uh twenty five
yeah mm let's say i am uh on channel eight now
you know these days we have hundreds of channels that's not so easy to go just next next next when you have hundreds of channels
mm-hmm
in fact i would propose another solution
or is it
basically you use just four or five channels right
most people yeah
yeah
so uh set up your t. v. set like channels that you use they're one
two three and five and you will never have to go to a twenty fives channel
in fact in in one uh remote control that i've seen instead of doing that d you could just say these are the cha ch channel three
twenty eight forty eight and uh sixty four are those that i want to by cycled with my next button
yeah it's it's the same solution i think
i uh
yeah
b yeah
hmm
but even we can have some uh l. c. d. display like you can uh de you can just button the number and then it go t because
go to channel twenty five
one thing is that as i said in my presentation people really do like to z zap
so even if they are only watching four or five channels
yeah
mm-hmm
i think they want to zap out of the one hundred channels just because this is one kind of thing they do zapping
but still
yeah
yeah uh on zap it's only next next next next next yeah
yeah
and it's only next
yeah
yeah so but you have to
mm
mm-hmm
we got these buttons here
okay
next next
yeah
or say this can be back
yeah
but otherwise like we can put some display on numbers and then they can just press suppose two five they just press two and five and then
so it would be
okay
yeah
maybe we can make uh different modes for each button and you can change mode zapping mode or
yeah
yeah yeah
mm-hmm
alright
uh current chan
yeah yeah
yeah but since we are focusing only on t. v. remote controls so we can have more functions for t. v. uh if you want to go for a universal then we ought to limit for functions for each of our devices
listening more
yeah
mm-hmm
okay
mm-hmm
could we carry out some research if we w really need this
like how many people really need to go to channel number twenty five and then to sixty four
well i could could uh have a look at that maybe
okay
yeah
yeah
i'll check in my department if there's someone specialist in that
okay
okay
although i don't know
alright
thanks for your attention
uh you're finish
okay
so now the technical aspects of this new device
mm
two
yeah if
sorry
you prefer it
yeah
uh as you know i am mister ramaro
i am an expert in uh industrial design of all electronic devices and i previously devised many uh like digital calculators and electronic calculators
so now i'll briefly describe the working design of our remote control
well as you know the basic function of remote control is sending some message to the the device like t. v. or v. c. r. or d. v. d. player etcetera
so we will have a p portable device which will send message to the the main device like t. v.
so we need to have some energy source to do what to do the functions what we want on this portable device
and usually this so to do these functions we need an interface which basically some kind of pressing buttons or keys or like moving jack or something like that
and then these messages these key buttons can be transferred into some kind of message and then it will process by the chip and then it will generate some information to the main device
it's generally in the form of infrared or
some kind of s sensor information
then we will have the main control in the main device to do the particular action what we want
so basically we need uh since we are focusing on our interface device remote control we need few components
mainly the energy source like the battery and then we have user interface like uh the keypad and you know buttons we want
and then we have some chip
it's mainly digital signal processing chip because since we are i am one doing mostly digital uh devices we ought to have some kind of processor which take care of all these functions and put it in some digital format
and then we'll have the infrared l. e. d. source which sends the information to the main device
then we'll have switch in our main uh um device to do particular operations and we ought to do different codes for different t. v. s
so some t. v. s will have different encryption codes for doing s s uh channel changing and these things
mm-hmm
okay
to make it quite uh an universal uh device uh
yeah yeah because the people don't use one particular brand so or at least we have more more than five brands which are really good
mm
okay
so we need to check their specifications and do their uh encryption that's passing information to the t. v. device
so we need to have particular encryption codes
okay
then components
so we have the main uh energy source and then we will have some buttons and then we will have infrared uh source and then we have some inside some chip in in the device
uh since i don't have much time so i'll input the connections to all this components
and since i also want to know feedback from our marketing expert and user interface so if you want to add some more components we can incorporate them
mm-hmm
mm-hmm
and from from the discussion we had do you can you make it on the whiteboard or mm
yeah
yeah i'm sure because since our user interface speech recognition and also marketing expert for the speech recognition is really handy
mm-hmm
mm-hmm
mm-hmm
so we can have another like uh s simple speech recogniser on our d. s. b. chip
mm
since we have some kind of uh energy this is our
this normal battery so this battery
once you s switch on it will take power and we can have some speech recognition and in our g generally small digital signal processing chip so that and we will put uh the small uh simple speech recogniser and we can also train the speech recogniser for particular user so you just yeah
on
uh train it okay
mm-hmm
mm-hmm
so that we just use simple recog no but but
too complex
but uh very very good to sell
yeah
no even in you can find even simple mobile device like any mobile brand you can have these voice dialers or these things yeah
think of a all these young people who would love to say that this remote control only works for them
okay
okay
and ha ha you cannot use my remote control because it's targeted to me
yeah
mm
yeah
whatever
and what about the price of this component
so
uh maybe we can make uh it in five euros and even less than that because we want to have uh millions and in bulk
it mm okay
hmm
cheap
millions
mm
so we can make really simp and we want to make really simple device because we have only very few words like like power
okay
cheap
switch on or some like then we'll have something like this um
mm-hmm
we'll have volume
and then we will have s particular channel so users can listen
the user uh will just be able to say uh please can you uh pump up the vo pump up the volume or or it will be something like volume
mm-hmm
ye
no yeah a user can use any kind of sender but they should have this prompt volume and then yeah volume and decrease or increase
up down
okay
with a keywords and yeah
so we try to only recognise those words and and because we can't really say user to say same wording then it become more mechanical and yeah
okay
couple of words
mm-hmm mm
mm-hmm
okay
okay
um
and then we can have channel they can say okay i want eight because we don't know like users have different programmes
i mean they don't really follow same channels strict uh so we just want channel number we don't want like b. b. c. or c. n. n. or something else because
okay
okay
of course uh it has to be
it will be complicated so we'll have only these three uh main basic uh anyway volume is not really speech recognition problem
okay
it's it it will be take care of our main mm
no you know it's a conceptual question
'cause now i see th this the picture in front of my eyes like a user taking his remote control and shouting into it
volume up volume up and and he's coming you know he's really annoyed with this down up down
but then i think you
you
first of all i i think this is not uh functionality that it is going to be instead of using the buttons
no in no not only speech yeah
it's on top of using the button
okay for this budget like twelve euros
i it's an option
well i dunno
yeah actually we we can have one switch to like uh switch on on and off this processor and
this really suppose like here we have our main chip which controls power volume and this part and this d. s. p. s
mm-hmm
again this to have some interaction like suppose people use d. s. p. then it particularly sends some information to the chip like in some form
like volume and like this key
so it may not be like very expensive because since we are only focusing on t. v. remote control so and we have only few things here
okay
t. v.
okay
mm-hmm mm-hmm
sho to to train okay
yeah
did you consider the r gest uh gesture recognition
like if i want to put volume up i like do mm i take my remote control do like something like
um uh uh this point we didn't consider because it's it's very expensive because v our target is only like twelve point five euros and
roll 'em up or roll 'em down
mm
very expensive no
and well what about the idea of automatic on off on the button yeah
mm why
that's just
and volume control
yeah even automatic on off is also a bit problematic
because it different criteria for different people like so suppose people are really uh they just uh they don't touch the remote and mm y you don't know how much time you need to switch on or switch off and
so but uh
sh should we target a a user personalised uh uh remote control
so in in a given room there might be more than one remote control
we would uh have each one and uh with our own personal uh settings
yay yeah
yeah that can be possible especially for power settings so user can say okay
suppose they're watching a tennis match or something then they can say okay uh after one hour i
hmm
wouldn't that make uh arguments
they can make
yeah of course
i want uh
that's no problem we will sell more
yeah we can have
and we can increase this the strength y you can buy one with
we got a really good market expert
yeah exactly
yeah
let's send more let's sell more
okay
mm-hmm
okay
you have mm something else to say
uh not very much like yeah
uh
no
okay
thanks
okay thanks
thank you
yep
thank you
so
can you just yeah
mm
mm i think okay we're just on time
um mm mm
so we're now going to l have the lunch break
mm great
then we will work again for thirty minutes individual work and um
we will uh meet again for the next meeting and uh in this one want to
to be more focused on the individual actions the um on the components so
uh
you will focus on the component concept um
yeah yeah
uh of course the u. i. d. mark will be uh focused on the user interface concept and uh our m market expert sammy benjo uh on the trend watching
mark will
so um of course like before specific instruction will be sent to you by your personal personal coach
well i think that's all
and we have um maybe we have to we say only for t. v. not teletext
uh i think automatic on off control uh it's not possible
uh it's in current price yeah
difficult
yeah maybe in the next uh step if we make it work um
yeah
but speech recogniser can be possible
yeah implemented
o okay we can think about that
mm-hmm
and um
do you see something else
no
uh should it be equipped with the
uh with uh speakers
speakers in the remote cont
like you want to find it you shout
oh yeah
control and it answers is i'm here
uh yeah that's
or
it just beeps
that would be enough
just beeps
or maybe you want to phone him
something very cheap
but that's ex that's expensive
yeah yeah yeah
since now all yeah
uh
yeah especially the power it really consumes because it should be all the time on and
think
uh-huh
well i i heard of devices where you just uh whistle them and and they because of the the frequency they they just answer to that
and uh
and it's answered
yeah
yeah
i can't whistle
no no i can't
you can't whistle
uh-huh
or a clap
mm
clap clap clap it's a good i i think it's universal
you can clap
can you
yeah
clap is good
yeah
tak
just a suggestion
okay
what about people without hand
yeah
with only one hand
yeah i think it's good
these are not our target people
mm uh okay
but it's a good feature i guess yeah we need to think about more how to incorporate it
mm-hmm
okay
just don't interfere with other devices like 'cause like all these people do that their lights are turning on with clapping
mm-hmm
oh that's e that already exists okay okay
oh
yeah i got it at my home like
mm-hmm
oh yeah you do have
oops
wow
ah it's
you're trendy
mm-hmm so let's to think s so that yeah
think about it
yeah okay
i think that could be in the component uh concept uh
yeah
it yes
okay
okay
good we're done
so yeah let's go to lunch
yeah
right thanks
thank you thank you very much
okay so now we are on the conceptual design meeting
uh y getting close to the last is the penultim meeting
mm-hmm
how was lunch
thanks don't be sarcastic
mm great
mark
so um i will again do the secretary part uh we will have three presentation first um uh the industrial design first rama then mark and then sammy
uh rama
ramaro
um um we have to take a decision on the control remote control concepts and we have forty minutes
mm
so what we want to the decision we want to take on this meeting are on the um first on the component concept
so what kind of energy we use uh what kind of chip on print and one ki kind of case
and also on user interface concept uh what kind of interface we use and if there is some supplements
and at the end um sammy will give um a trend watching on what he's he's been doing
it's
so let's go
first
with rama
participant two
yeah participant two
component
mm-hmm
yep
so we're to mainly design f mainly need to know which components we'll use for energy and the material and interface
for energy there are maybe two or three possibilities
first one we can use simple battery or we can use traditional solar cells or mm and the material we can have plastic
rubber which is good for this r. s. a. and then uh titanium
ah
which can be which have very good look an and then interface we're to use push buttons or liquid crystal d l. c. d. display
and we can use some moving kind of thing
so as we discussed before we need to we would like to have some speech recognition s chip in our remote control
so this can be simple kind of programmable chip and which can use microphone sensors
and we also want to look at our remote control so
still we are looking for possible uh technical uh specifications and how w easy we can do and within our pri range
like we're to in our twelve euros or around that
so we are looking for simple devices or simple technology to do the location of remote control in a room or in a house
mm-hmm okay
so uh we discussed an
excuse me
so we would like to propose battery instead of solar cells and it would be problematic uh to have enough energy with the solar cells and so we would like to just use simple battery
mm-hmm
and also we want to go for titanium design instead of rubber or and well the problem is with this design we found that we can't use double curved shapes
what is a double curved shape
like you can have two curves
uh-huh
why
uh it's i think in manufacturing i guess it's problematic
so
we want to go for simple push buttons because it need a simple chip and it's really lesser uh re really less expensive compared to l. c. d. which are uh which needs advanced chip technology and it's more expensive
since we want to put some other features such as speech recognition we want to reduce uh cost
mm-hmm
um i want to know why it b uh just uh sorry but for the point before uh why not the rubber
the cost
uh
if it is something that it seems to be light
uh
and also like in if you put a it's be difficult to do all the moulding of buttons and these things and
okay
you m titanium it's more uh
yeah
w we can use something like you know the whole body's titanium but there are some rubber or i dunno some rubber parts like to make it feel better and to you know
mm like this
yeah
yes so mm
like in cell phones recently these you can with the rubber in four directions and yeah
mm-hmm
yeah
uh-huh
yeah
okay
but full assembly
we'll use mainly for titanium rubber is expensive and also it's bit difficult to do all the shapes uh
okay
okay
okay
and this push buttons we we would like to use push buttons instead of l. c. d. s and so we want to mo i mean we're we want to put speech recognition so we want to reduce price on this technology and so that we can have enough space or enough money for
uh yeah so
okay s so simple button and uh speech recognition for the more complicated
s s
speech
y yeah we have simple buttons and speech recognition technology so
mm-hmm
okay
okay and still we have mm can we still include the l. l. s. d. display
l. c. d.
l. c. d. yeah l. c. d.
uh l
seems not it's either l. c. d. or push button
so uh it's like a
no it's not gonna be a t no touchable but still like a source of information or source for menus
ah
yeah maybe maybe we can see depending on how we'll come up with our full design then if we have enough money or like for and because the speech recognition technology will take at least five euros or or something so we want to reduce the cost on display or this inter
okay so let's try it let's t
the l. c. d. would
the display would only be display and not uh touch sensitive you mean
yeah yeah it's it's not gonna be a touch pad uh just a display for giving you information
just uh for output yeah
yeah
ok
yeah that can we we can consider because like it won't take much money i guess because
mm-hmm
mm-hmm
okay
okay yep
mm
you have any further questions or
i guess no um
so the batteries uh are going to be very light
yeah
yeah we're to go for li and now i think we have many options in the market so we can go for small nickel or alkaline batteries for
okay
mm-hmm
mm-hmm
really light batteries and with uh good price
so this device on n that can be used for speech recognition could also be used for just uh the finding it basically
instead of clapping why not just be ask
yeah
that's then the the one thing we want to know is like because remote control is used for like in the household so it it it will be it m maybe at least five
six people want to use it so so how to uh uh how to define our re speech recognition whether we want to do s speaker independent or speaker dependent
mm-hmm
if we're going for more speaker independent then it would be like again cumbersome and we need really m more technology and so
okay for the location
yeah if if everybody in the house n to locate then we're to go for some speaker independent technology or something
hmm
okay
okay
so let's now go to the you don't have more question
no it's okay
no more questions
um mm thank you mm
yep
thank you
puts less of constraint on what we can do but
mm yeah yeah
yeah
yeah
it's always like that
we have dreams and the in the end we find out that it's not feasible
yeah but mm
oh
anyway
we have uh some limitations
yeah
but still uh l. s. d. 's already quite nice l. c. i'm an artist sorry
l. c. d.
l. s. d. is something else and it's quite nice as well
okay
so go on uh artist
so uh that's not i hope that's not too much
um yeah
now let's talk about uh interface
okay
uh participant number three
three
three
uh
which one
hmm
mm
mm uh have a look at this no it's yeah
okay
uh so the concept of the interface
generally i developed quite a broad concept not only for the interface but for
possible instruction or user's manual and uh all the complex things that come together with your t. v. and remote controls
so let's start with this
we got our perfect remote control with a lot of buttons and uh we got explanation for every button and you can use your time and uh it will take i some days to learn all this buttons and um the l. c. d. is going to be somewhere here
and uh go back button i don't know really where it is maybe one of this buttons
and um power on and off mm i i don't remember so uh it it it should be maybe this button is power on and off
mm
or no
i can see nothing
so that's our concept
it's called the millennium remote control
let's change millenniums
so maybe you can use in the end and
yeah
doesn't make sense
this is very ugly
really
i thought you like it
oh no too much concept
ah okay just press the button please uh
ah
no
uh
yeah we will not use this
we will not use this
but instead of this i will devise that's our concept
ah back today
and it's got just few buttons quite low looking and all this stuff we already
we already discussed
mm-hmm
'kay
and uh what will people say
they'll say it's perfect
or what will say
uh they will say it's splendid
and uh e everyone will say i'll buy it
mm-hmm
and everyone's gonna be satisfied
do you think it can come in several colours
or did the
i would make a backlight of the l. c. d. screen with different colours
um but not the case
not the case
uh the case would only be in that uh aluminium uh titanium stuff like
yeah
mm
because apparently from your survey people like colours no
yeah well they like uh something which is uh
yeah
okay so let's remember there's a nokia phone which changeable panels
mm yeah okay so that would be the option
do you like it
i don't know i don't have a nokia phone but
but it's uh
i don't use that but again uh i might
that's why you don't have it
yeah bu but
that's why 'cause it's nasty
but it would be expensive no
if you use colour l. c. d.
no
uh instead of that maybe we can change the colour of the assembler
mm-hmm
maybe we can just if users want more colours they can pay more money to get this
uh the shapes and they can have different assembly
um i am here
so users have different i mean they have their own interests colour interests and so
okay
so
mm-hmm
so we can just if they want they can just pay another
two euro
uh-huh okay so you you propose something with option i that increase the price if we if you want o more colours on l. c. d. yeah
'kay
yeah
yeah yeah yes
if they want like uh so that we can yeah
kind of upgradable uh remote control
yeah
wow wow
okay
just they'll get few more
things and few more colours
okay what uh there's one more decisi uh one more solution in fact
um 'cause there are some some paints that can change colour according to where they are like they can reflect different colours
lights yeah
mm
and thermodynamic also
depending on what is around like what colour is around and depending on the temperature yeah
yeah
mm-hmm
like a chameleon
mm-hmm
yeah yeah
we can make it in fact
yeah but that's maybe mo too much expensive yeah
mm
if if if the okay
mm-hmm
but uh it can be in uh maybe in an a gradable version but
mm-hmm mm-hmm so
yeah
because uh i think there are two kinds of people
those for which the remote control is uh
is to be uh something useful uh i'm going to talk about this later but and those for which is something that that that uh is uh specific to them so it it's like a signature
my remote control is pink
nobody else than me has a pink remote control
mm-hmm
uh-huh
and that makes me special
okay and you think that we don't have to make to make them pay more because of uh o or this is
i think i think they would be ready p ready to pay more for that
okay so
those who wanted to have it pink
so i it's not uh a s base service it's a
uh
no mm no
mm
so be an option yeah
mm
it might be optional yeah
okay
but those people will be really few no
so like we can those
the the young people the young people want to be different from their friends
ah
although similar but have something just slightly better
mm-hmm
yeah
pink
so m so maybe that's if that it's a selling point maybe it has to be the base
mm
yeah yeah yeah
mm
yeah
but you know if you want to be different you just take your remote control with you all the time
and you'll be different
and it makes you different you know
yeah yeah
you always have your remote
uh in the train uh hello uh no
oh you don't
anyone has their remote controls here
yeah
you don't have your remo
no
want to change my neighbour
wh you you know like for instance take the ipod
it's a kind of remote control
uh it's white and it's so white that you see it from any anywhere
mm-hmm
it has this distinctive look and feel and look which people seems to like just because it's a colour that we don't usually see in a remote control
mm
okay
white
uh-huh uh-huh
mm-hmm
could we integrate something into our remote control something like light
seems important
hmm
that they can use it in darkness like
mm glow in the dark so
hand light yeah
yeah maybe like the infrared like we can put some
mm-hmm
radium chips or something so that like at least um yeah
iradium
okay
yeah that
ah sorry
okay
mm
okay
okay
okay
s well let's go on maybe with the presentation
so mm
yeah
uh-huh yeah sure
mm-hmm
and um the remote control's going to be smart but how smart should it be to not to complicate things too much
oh
and uh
i dunno that's a question to you and to mm to
well so i heard that uh it seems that speech recognition is something that can be done uh so that's the smartness of the thing
currently we don't have guns with speech recognition or uh beer cans with speech recognition but we may have remote controls with speech recognition
mm-hmm
okay okay
i dunno
mm that's a nice world
so just just just just think about it um
thank you
don't touch the remote
okay
but yeah
are are you saying here that uh the remote controls should be aware of who is using it
so for instance the young guy would not be able to use it because his father doesn't want
uh yeah i just want to say it should be real smart
like with some
maybe fingerprint recognition or
voice recognition is quite tough
i say don't use it and the control just looks
mm
yeah
'cause i ordered jus
um
mm
uh that mm that could be feasible i guess like
to l to l lock it
okay
so since we have we want to do some speaker dependent speech recognition uh so we can use yeah
so it could be
smart in that way
yeah yeah
mm
okay
but for instance th i i'm thinking about the other uh uh particularity that the the remote control could have
s since it it knows who is using it
it might also record the kind of uh channels you are u more often using and uh levels of volumes that you're more often uh things like that and provide you ways of using them
yeah
yeah sure
mm
yeah
i dunno somehow i dunno that might be expensive but
yeah
mm-hmm
uh it's
that might also be a good sales pitch again
hmm
the remote that knows you
mm-hmm
okay
okay thanks
so it's yeah marketing expert
my turn
okay it's alright
participant two
four
four sorry
four i think
trend yeah
no uh yes
okay so i'm going to talk about trends and um i hope this can help us to to understand l how we should design our remote control
so next slide please
so first maybe just a small recap on how how do we watch trends so it's not so uh simple you might think that it's easy but uh it's not so simple
anyway these days uh the best uh source of information is the web as you know so have to
to go often on the web and look at uh what the others are doing
and ask real people who are using real remote controls every day uh or any other tool that is similar to a remote control which basically is a small device that people have with them
always like a phone
we can we can use the phone as a as a good uh uh example of where to in be inspired
of course those tha d who are watching the trends are also have also to be inspired because in fact they're not only watching the trends
they're inventing it they're creating the trend
i hope i'm going to try to help you on that
this is more risky because you're not following the trend you try to invent it
which means either you succeed and you make a lot of money or you don't and you're out of business
so anyway uh next slide please
uh to be to be quick there's a lot of words here but uh basically there are uh in in the market of of remote controls there are three aspects that we should very pay much attention to
the first one which seems to be the most important one is that it has to be fancy it has to have a fancy look and feel
and uh interestingly this is the very most important thing
it has to be fancy
strangely enough it's more important to be fancy than to be wi and now that's the second thing it has to be it has to be technologically i innovative
it has to be new with some of uh new uh technology inside and uh and this is also uh more important than the last thing which we w may think that would have been the most important
which is that it should be easy to use and it should be easy to use as a remote control
so as you see uh it first have to be very nice
s something that people are proud of uh uh that i uh they can be id identified with uh and and then uh something that um contains very novel stuff that they can talk about with their friends
huh mine has this and not yours
and finally of course it has to be useful as a remote control but it seems that it's not so important that it's useful as a remote control
next slide please
mm
uh and now in a more uh general uh uh broad way of seeing th uh the thing
if we look back and not uh look at only remote controls i think it's important to see that the trends are quite the same in many areas so currently the the trends that we see in l in l big cities like paris and milan
well it seems that this year things should have uh a fruit and vegetable uh way of of look or feel or so
and i think of course uh i it applies to everything
that's the thing with trends
it it can travel f from clothe to furniture same idea
fruit and vegetable
think fruit and vegetable
and uh if we co we compare to last year now it has to be spongy yeah
mm
what is spongy
well this so so i think uh uh i
yeah kind of um maybe
when we were talking about rubber i think uh the rubber aspect might be important because it's what is probably more feasible in terms of sponginess
yeah it
mm-hmm
yeah
s
yeah
so maybe titanium it's not a good idea
seems not seems not
we need to think about mm mm
mm-hmm
yeah
so
um sorry mark
it seems to be
think more of uh something in the colours of uh like fruit and vegetables and spongy
fruit
even shape
as a even in the shape it has to be more round and uh
more yeah
more uh uh look natural somehow
mm mm
yeah
i mean
and not those futuristic uh remote control with angles and uh and titanium like
mm-hmm
mm
so that's what people seem to yeah i i know it's quite far from what you thought but that's that's fashion and
hmm
you're old fashioned
sorry
okay
okay
okay that's all i have to say
mm you have questions
so these abilities are mainly ad addressed by young people
or it's
these i'm sorry
this you you so did you
yeah yeah we have people uh uh listening to the trends everywhere in the world of course
where
oh
oh okay mm-hmm
as you know our company is quite big and uh so i'm just asking them what are the current trends according to them when they go in the stores and when they ask uh their uh friends that are also well
it's not from mm
mm-hmm
yeah
yeah
it's more general trend it's not particular to the remote control
no it's not it's not this this is very general yeah
but it seems that trends travel across things
mm
yeah
the what we
yeah but some materials n they're to be
uh they're to be something like solid like they can't be really spongy or yeah yeah
sure
yeah
we have to i think we have to have the look of fruit and vegetables but we still have to put our chips inside so of course
yeah yeah sponge yeah yeah at least that's
yeah yeah that yeah yeah
this is your problem
this is not mine
yeah
yeah looking yeah fruit
these things can be easily incorporated
we can have t colours or this shape or at least yeah
yeah i think in the colours and in the uh the kind of material
if if it's something like rubber made or i think it it's also going to be good
yeah
mm
mm
mm-hmm
okay
yeah
okay
no more question
okay
yep
thanks
so
mm-hmm
okay so we will have uh next meeting in thirty minutes again
um now you have to go straight on this individual action which i which are for rama uh wil design
look and feel de
um mark the user interface design and uh sammy uh the product evaluation
mm-hmm
uh you will work together uh on a new on on a prototype using modelling clay
hmm
hmm
mm sounds interesting
mm-hmm um
and i as always your personal coach will send you specific instruction
okay
okay
thanks
so can we highlight the specific features of our yeah
yeah you're right you have to
so so we want the speech recogniser and we want some kind of buttons and we want some themes like fruits or vegetables
that's we want to follow general trend
so you say s
spongy
s do we agree on that
yeah
yeah
we have to
so do you think
no we don't have to but seems it's the trend
so we have to uh for
no
hmm
again as i said we can also try to make it to create the trend
yeah
yeah so are we confident enough on creating trends
so there's no
yeah
well that's you t can try to convince us
well we can make it smell like fruit
okay
okay that's a good idea
that's
that's a good idea i
so titanium smell like fruit
yeah
mm-hmm
so what about location and these things people are really interesting on those features
or they really like
uh
they more want these fancy features like
i think i yeah i it's again in this uh what i said first it has to be fancy so i think if nobody else pro provides currently a remote control with that kind of stuff and if we can provide it i think it's a good sell for us because we have it and others don't
mm-hmm
feature
yeah
yeah
okay
it's fancy
whether it's useful or not doesn't seem to be very important
yeah
i i agree with uh this uh
yeah
now we have to decide on what kind of fanciness
do we take titanium smelling like fruit or do we make spongy
uh fruity like
yeah
uh we will try to explore these two options and yeah yeah
maybe you could explore the two option
mm
yeah yeah
mm-hmm mm-hmm
could we make a titanium shape
uh yeah at least like we can make banana or
i mean fruit shaped
don't you say that you cannot do double shape uh curved shape yeah
but
yeah it's it's yeah that's a we're to look for and and s we're to see the whether rubber is expensive and d
doub double curved
mm
seems to be
mm-hmm
okay
okay okay
in fact i just agreed to make uh
to make the like titanium panels
on a whole
rubber body
hmm
well okay w we'll see
mm mm
okay so you explore now that you're going to work together these these two
yeah
mm
or or spongy an yeah
yeah
maybe we can have two different assembly also like one spongy and one kind of titanium
mm
we have only the plastic or the the chippy yeah fibre chips or
we'll see
if you have time
we'll see
mm
yeah i don't think w i think we have to choose
if we choose uh titanium or if we choose spongy but uh it cannot be both
uh
we'll see
i i really don't like this modelling clay 'cause you know it makes some for for i dunno uh yeah um we'll look
yeah
for creation
yeah
yeah
ah you can pretend that it's uh titanium
even design
you can paint it afterward
okay okay
no problem
we have a very large department of paint
yeah do don't worry you you you speak with mm mm
you will do it
alright alright
okay
so explore a shape
so still we want to keep l. c. d.
or
mm i think it's what we say that we have an uh an l. c. d. with uh information
yeah
okay
not uh
the thing is that uh if we want to have as he says if we want to have uh a small number of buttons we need to have a kind of output that says currently what their actions are
yeah then we can
mm-hmm
yeah yeah that user friendly or
yeah
mm
that's the converse to having zillions of button where each button does only one thing
mm
yeah
mm
yeah
okay
and we just stick with two batteries so it's not any solar or yeah yeah j yeah because
yeah
classical we stay classical in that we don't reinvent uh the wheel
yeah yeah yeah
yeah
mm
anyway it's very in general i think people uh change t. v. more often than batteries of their remote control
yeah
so
because the trend goes faster than the life of the
mm-hmm
mm-hmm
so it's very
okay
okay
so are we mm
yeah
yeah
we're done
yeah we're done
okay
so see you in thirty minutes
yep
mm
so hi christa
so uh now it's the hi sammy
it's the detail design meeting so we're going last meeting
so um first uh mark and rama are going to present uh the prototype
uh then uh sammy will propose some uh crite cr criteria to evaluate this prototype
yes
yes
then w we
and then we going to do some finance to see if uh it is uh feasible and uh at the end we will we will um evaluate ourself as a team
and chocolate
and that's all
mm
okay
so first let's uh
see the prototype
yeah
uh here we have our prototype model
okay
mm-hmm
and you have some slides then
yeah
yeah we have also some slides
yes and place some slides
yeah
mm
okay
uh so in which uh
in
uh participant three
prototype
yeah
mm okay
mm
five
uh so
him
this is our
remote control
it's a r working prototype
you can use it now by switching all these buttons
so first i present as we came to this perfect model and then we'll give some technical specifications
yeah
mm-hmm
that's well so that's that
please next slide
we analysed all the fruits and contacted nasa and uh made some real good yeah
masa
if you can see this and the stars are showing that
and um
mm-hmm
s society will accept that
for sure
and making some analysis of different fruits we choose the ultimate form ultimate colours and uh ultimate smell of it
s please next slide
but we still didn't want to go far from our titanium idea 'cause it's the most of the moder the m
the modern material we can p select
and it's practical
and it's still say it's for our needs so please press something
and as i said it's perfect
okay
please press it
experience
explanat
everyone is f really uh really glad to obtain an
such a nice thing
see this
s such a r such a device
so you can touch it with your hands
can i
ho ho
sure
you can
yes
what do you say
n
it says
you must say it
spongy
i will uh
one day
i'll buy it
yeah
if i if i need so
he
hopefully my daughter will like it
okay
y and we got the answer
uh it is yes of course
yes of course
of c course
please next slide
um this is a prototype
you can have a look at it and
ah
that's all i wanted to say
now it's technical specification by our
hmm
colleague
hmm
so
oh there is a button missing
okay
yeah
this this is really flexible
you can add your buttons
it's in option
yeah
so function mm
mm-hmm
so as we discussed we have to switch on switch off whenever we want
and so we have buttons and using l. c. d.
or like you can use this jog wheel and select which ever option on the l. c. d. and then do on and off
then you ha you'll have volume control
so you you can press these buttons to increase or decrease the volume
and we have some l. c. d. controls
like m switching the l. c. d. display if you want to use l. c. d. or you don't want you can just use normal button
mm-hmm
and we have speech recognition
here you have microphone and then it date records your voice and then it try to recognise
hmm
and it can also do the action
and location finder
and we want to do the location basically using speech recogniser
mm-hmm
you can just say where is my remote control
or uh you can just give some nickname to your remote control like bobby
hey babe
bobby
and then it will say hi
bob
hey bob
yeah hi and then you can use it
okay that's good
mm-hmm
hmm
'kay
so um our team is now fruits
mainly strawberry
so you can have and then you can see the look l. c. d. and all the switches
oh these are strawberries
are colourful
yeah
material we want to stick to titanium
we will send we want to
fruit smelling spongy titanium
i didn't know it exist but that's great
yeah or s
so we want to have simple and perfect shapes like i shown in these phones
you can have your own designs and and you can feel simple designs
and you can choose colours on your day for each day or even many colours
ha
ho ho
you mean we can change the colour uh of th
that's for the l. c. d. or for the titanium
for the l. c. d.
yeah
yeah okay for the l. c. d.
with titanium it's it is silver
tit titanium is
we are still working on titanium
mm mm
yeah
uh okay
so r we'll start with l. c. d.
mm yeah
you can ask bob
it's tuesday
yeah
yeah bob please
hey you know you're theme today
tuesday colour
yeah
even you can configure your colours for its the depending on your mood or s
okay
hmm
mm-hmm
black for sunday
and you can have many colours on weekends
or
and w wait wh what are the strawberries for
on the l. c. d.
wh wh
huh
oh
ah these are like sensors
of course
mm-hmm
what do you think
that's location sensors
strawberry sensors
very useful
okay
strawberries
so after this meeting we'll propose a party for our success for
ah
lounge meeting
so if you are vegetarian or you have any options please let us know
yeah and we can just some strawberry first
yeah
um
okay
alright
good
oops
s
mm-hmm
so huh
interesting
uh we'll see in the financial part if uh all gets into
so any specific questions for
in interesting
mm mm
it makes sense
yeah
let's make a party first maybe
yeah
w
then we can discuss we can
who is the five uh fifty millions we first make a party in
so uh this is
yeah then we can have how much for how money is left
mm-hmm
what a design
okay
uh so
it's my turn
let's uh yeah let's see if uh th it's meet the evaluation criterium
mm-hmm
let's see if this yeah if you meet
yeah
the evaluation criterion
oops
fudge
yeah
so evaluation please
so
you made a very nice prototype and um i think
we now need altogether to try to evaluate it to see if it makes sense to do it
if it fulfils our what we want to do and things like that
so mm
uh next slide please
as you know before going and uh creating and producing these strawberry uh remote control
yeah
it's very important to first verify if it makes sense if we have a chance to sell it
uh so we need to evaluate it um try to do it in a constative way and as much as we can
to so what i propose is that we are going to to have this scale from one to seven
one meaning that ye yes uh it fulfils uh the the criterion whatever it is
and seven meaning no it doesn't fulfil at all
and we're all l going to list all the criterion
i'm going to go to that next slide and together try to evaluate this according to this criterion and from one to seven
okay
and then we are just going to have an average which will give us the value of our uh remote control
so maybe we can have a look at the criteria
fancy
so these are the criterion uh i'm i thought were important
of course this can be discussed but let's let's see so let's vote
so we have fancy here and we have the scale
mm-hmm
from one to seven
with four in the middle
so
huh
yeah what's is really
what do you think is it fancy
uh it's really
uh i think that fancy we can say it is fancy
it is very very fancy
or have you ever seen something like that
oh
i am not the d the only one choosing yeah
yeah of course
what do you think
uh what do you think
feel the weight
is it
the weight is later
yeah
oh
really
uh-huh
now we're we're on the fanciness now
okay
i think it's quite fancy
yeah yeah
it's uh
we can give at least five or six seven
yeah
yeah
yeah so no it's it's one
it's in the other
yeah
yeah o one means it's yes a very fancy and seven mean no at all
oh oh
so oh okay
mm
yeah okay
oh okay
so
so it's one or two
what do you think
two
m maybe two
let's say two yeah
two
okay
two
two
so here two
up
then we have uh technology
technology
yeah
um
so what about technology
we have uh we have speech recognition we have location based we have l. c. d.
and we have l. c. d.
so you change colours
change colour of t
change colour i mean that's very
useful
yeah i think it's a
quite d i think it's a one for that at least
yeah yeah yeah
yeah
yeah yeah
yeah
yeah
uh
it's silly
at least a one yeah
mm mm
robustness uh-huh
uh still we need to cha
so let's suppose my daughter take it and um and through it away
um
do you think it makes sense that it's going to live again
uh maybe not the prototype
the strawberries oh
yeah it maybe strawberry
let's try
oh my god
okay we just lost one strawberry
no
so not at all
oh
no
how can i say this
yeah we can easily plug it
it's still it's still working and your daughter got a bonus
it is
yeah
a strawberry
yeah
so it's not so bad
mm mm
i um uh i would say three
yeah yeah
yeah
but it's too
yeah
yeah that does make sense yeah
it's um robust yeah
useful
useful
well so the question is does it have uh the minimum requirement of re remote control
yeah
so i don't know
these buttons are uh it not clear
oh yeah lets me try
but you have at least uh next produce
yeah
yeah
what is uh next please
yeah channel
i this is volume control and channel changes
uh it depends on the okay
these are the main
and you can uh do di two sites
you
yeah
yeah
yeah and you can do on l. c. d. using these going to scrolling all the option
okay also
so but for instance because the l. c. d. is not uh touch control touch screen you cannot go to channel twenty five directly
so if you don't want
yeah um yeah
you can by using the
yeah
you can
directly
you go you so the basic mode yeah
you c push here the the yeah
so that's simple
the basic mode is uh you got just two buttons and a jog dial
yeah
with two buttons you do this like uh volume up volume down
oh it's a jog dial okay
uh-huh
and channel
or if you go to the site it's channel up channel down
okay
and if you want to make to s twenty five you push on this
yeah
you can select
you select twenty you select five
okay
that's it
yeah mm
it's much longer than that that being two two five no
no
don't you think so
may not okay we can go
that's uh you're right
yeah yeah yeah
y you need to like press two and five and yeah
that's it's less uh yeah
but it's it's nice because people anyway don't go there
but
yeah yeah
yeah mm
so what do you think for it usefulness
so d yeah we need to address we want we only address two main functions here and the other functions will be on l. c. d.
seems to be useful
so
let me understand well because i'm not sure that's for that this one are b d uh two dir directional button
so
both
yeah
yeah two
yeah
yeah
yeah
yeah
up down or left right
yeah
yeah
up
yeah
yeah
and which what is that
that
it's a jog dial for controlling the cursor on the l. c. d. screen
this is jog wheel
okay okay
yeah
it's a kind oh okay okay
like selecting the menus
um see in l. c. d. like you will have blocks and you select which one
cool
oh oh okay great
i would say then uh
now it's looks us useful
two or three
yeah
yeah
two or three
yeah
two maybe
two
yeah
okay two
so size and weight
yeah yeah
is it the the the effective size and weight that the is it uh real size real weight
or because it size is going to be that yeah
yeah it's size al almost
yeah because it is the weight will be bit lighter
uh and and
we will s we use titanium
sure without titanium alloy it's going to be light
mm mm
yeah
yeah
it's going to be lighter because this seems to be very heavy f i mean for my daughter for instance
yeah
of course
heavy
yeah
mm-hmm
yeah
not sure if uh she can use it
but sides uh the sides should be okay
so should be okay
yeah mm
up to three for that because i'm haven't seen the weight so i must not uh colour and shape
mm mm
okay
oh
okay
uh oh
well so colour it seems that we have the several colours for the l. c. d.
yeah
yeah
but um it's not very clear what is the colour of the sh the sh the case
yeah
the case is silver titanium no
it's a it's going to be titanium
yeah it's
yeah
okay okay
that's nice
let's imagine
i think it's good
okay
and what about the strawberries on the top
i'm not convince
yahoo
but maybe i'm not trendy
but uh
well y you know it's this uh fruit and vegetable year
oh
yeah yeah
yeah but uh uh they're not useful
so
yeah
so maybe i think
i i mean it that's uh
uh i think usefulness is m as as i rem um just have to remind you that usefulness is much less important than fanciness
mm-hmm
yeah
yep
yeah well
whether it's fancy or not now it we have to decide
yeah
um
hmm
but this if it's
i would have m uh i found more fancy that the fruits are useful
uh-huh
so that they will that maybe the fruit may be here instead
yeah
yeah well then it's bit difficult to use
not like this d we're just giving the fruit for more fanciness and more attraction too
mm-hmm
but the n yeah
so maybe think we can have rubber or some sponges stuff for strawberries and different colours
mm
so it's even
so it seems we are not so clear on the shape uh
no i'm not sure uh why uh if it was like this
these buttons
but it looks really not really good
i
it's n no it's not fancy any more
i mean the f yeah
so these are kind of rubber things
even if you lose one you can just put whatever
okay
and
even we can provide many different colours or different fruits and
uh-huh
and different routes
moreover moreover it covers it covers all the end goals
okay i see what
yeah
even if it is you know it's very rounded but still you got some rubber fruit here
and it's completely uh completely secure to leave it uh with children and that
yeah
okay so you you you feel like it's something uh a protection for the remote control
yeah
yeah
yeah
yeah we've yeah we have sensors here and so here and here so we just yeah so even if you don't put it works
also
but this is really fancy
okay
i suggested three
okay
because uh everybody s doesn't seem to be convince although it's quite you have good arguments
okay
okay
yeah
yeah
but
okay
and uh the last one is adaptive
this is not r maybe not as important as the other one but uh can we adapt it to each each personal use
yeah
sure sure just look at it
great
it's full adaptable
wow that's a
fully adaptable
yeah you can fit it into your palm you know
that's yeah
so you can fit into your palm okay
yea
that what else can we need
yeah
you can yeah
you do you think you are gonna be able to do that with ti titanium as well
yeah it's fudge titanium
it's fudge yeah yeah
you know
right yeah
mm
yeah fruit titanium yeah
and uh
well i if if this is if you are ready to do that then i think it deserves a one
yeah
okay
let's go for one
okay
yeah
now we have to do the average
three three six eight eleven
who is good in math
it's two point one seven
okay
two point one seven
that's nice
two point one seven out of seven
hmm
i think we have a good
yeah
good thing
well that's all i had to say about the evaluation
so
so it's a good evaluation
it seems to be good yeah
yeah
yeah mm
mm
we have uh
yeah two one one seven we have
yeah
so
mm mm
yeah
okay
thanks
okay
so now it has to fulfil the financial criterium
financi
ah ha
so i have an here
um
energy
so so how many batteries do we need
uh we use bat
one battery
one battery
yep
okay so two
good
why two
oh we just need one i guess
say no
no ne never install
uh-huh
two batteries or one
oh
no number is one
we need only one battery
only one
yeah yeah but the price is two
no no
oh number
but no no
no uh you just number
sorry sorry sorry
number number
no no way
i'm sorry
yeah
yeah
yeah
yeah
you never use uh excel
oh
no never
good
how what what's the limit
h
it's twelve bucks
uh it's it's okay that i don't know 'cause uh it's not my field
twelve bucks
twelve bucks
okay now mm-hmm
twelve and a half i think
so we
check that number also
okay
okay electronics
we have sample chip
so
uh like simple chip yeah
it's a simple chip
simple chip okay
so yeah
one
yeah
four buttons at least
okay
okay
and then we have the t sample speaker sensor for speech recognition
and for the
one also
one or two
yeah one to one
one
yeah one
okay
so the case which one uh is it in the end
yeah i think we will go for a single curve no
let's do a single curve
oh is
it's it's flat
it's flat and curved
oh
oh okay
i thought you can curve somebody
it's flat
but it is flat you look
it's curvable
it's curvable but it's not curved
maybe there is a supplement for that no
mm-hmm
it's only curve
okay let's go
oh see i i think that the the price is this one
yeah
this okay you d we tried we tried
yeah yeah
don't chip on me
oh
oh okay
so what is it
titanium
t titanium
mm-hmm
mm
mm that's expensive
mm mm
mm-hmm
mm
yeah
but she wanted u the fudge titanium
okay
yeah well
let's stick to s titan
i think it's five but you don't say
special colour
no because uh
well n why three
no only one no
mm
why three
oh sorry
again i'm see it
yeah
um
special colour or it's only on the
interface
oh
yes in l. c. d. display
ok
yeah but there is no colour here
yeah an yeah
so i put it here
push button
so the l. c. d.
how many push button
scro
three or two
uh two
two
is there the scroll wheel okay
yeah
yeah
it's going to be expensive
one scroll wheel
one l. c. d.
displayed
okay
um
that's that's not we choose this one and not this one
that's all
no
yeah
oh i think no it's uh is it a scroll wheel and pe push button th this centre one
yeah it's cheaper
or only a scroll wheel
yeah
or only only scroll wheel okay
only scroll wheel
yeah mm
so
you are trying to make make up make us up
you try to s no no no
it's already
because how do you do to y select
ah
no but you select with the two d the other two buttons no
y ye
yeah i mean you you go on the location with your scroll wheel and then you
that's true
yeah
yeah
then it automatically we can just do like you feel it goes
yeah
stay longer
and it will activate um plus yeah it's price is really
it should stay
okay
yeah
oops
okay okay
um
special colours yeah
mm-hmm
for buttons
okay
yeah buttons and strawberries
no buttons just normal
yeah
special form
you you have all of these no
she's very hard on this
mm maybe n not this one but
special colour
yeah
no
special material
uh we have titan
that's for buttons
but buttons are standard
yeah buttons are the standard buttons
yeah
it's only buttons these
yeah so
nothing special
yeah
okay
so we are at seventeen dot eight
not special colours an interest in
no the colour is in the l. c. d.
and buttons are not colourised
they are m
i no
mm-hmm i think uh because you can just go for a good colours
we can just use this red
yeah and uh
it's
boo hoo
it's already too expensive
yeah
apparently
so what is are we supposed to cut things out now
yeah
mm
uh until we get twelve fifty
mm-hmm
mm
oh
so think of what we can cut uh here
well
if i look at what is the most expensive things uh it's the l. c. d. and the speaker
sample speaker
yeah
apparently we have to choose one or the other
yeah
yeah
yeah
well as you may know there's some research done in the field of producing energy from mechanical eng i mean producing electricity from mechanical energy
so the point is that when you take device and push the button you produce enough energy
but you don't need a battery
to make electricity
yeah that you don't need a battery
mm
mm-hmm
so it's something like hand dynamo robot
a real high tech version of it
so that would
but um it's like the hand dynamo no
maybe the jog wheel can be like kind of hand
so but if we select the hand dynamo it's okay we only we we win one
is
okay but l
yeah
that's already that
uh it's a it's a beginning
okay let's do that
yeah
why not
okay
let's do that
so
one here and here
yeah just remo
'kay
and i propose to so uh about chips
s
advanced chip on print right
mm-hmm
so put minus one there please
i'm not sure if this is legal
mm
yeah
why not
that's right
uh no
and
and
m maybe minus uh three no
no
yeah
okay let's see
so was there result
no no
it's not
mm-hmm
let's have a look
it's not changing no
it you don't
yeah yeah yeah if click somewhere you'll see features
why
mm
oops
yes it does
so oh sorry
maybe put minus two so it looks uh more reasonable
yeah
why not
yeah anyway no minus two
minus
mm-hmm
nobody will know
mm
it's not recorded is it
good
okay we're on time
okay
good
so now on we can increase our still you have two more
oh we can put uh a hand dynamo and a battery if you want
maybe we can use it for our party
and a battery and a battery yeah
oh
yeah
yeah yeah
both its it's cool
no now we are exp exceeding i think
now it's fancy let's add one instead of two
yeah that
it
mm
is it
yeah yeah y
i think we're exceeding now
we have to remove the
no but point five point three
uh it's better
okay
i think they are counting uh we would prefer yeah
yeah
is really strict
mm
it's maximum and don't have to yeah yeah
maximum is maximum
oh
so remove one of them
uh
oh yeah
yeah
okay
okay we're uh on target
uh mm mm
yeah
mm
okay
mm
so target reached
i'm just curious to see this uh my address chip on print
ho
it's um english uh yeah
trick
uh i would say it's the russian trick but anyway no they may have some their origins strange origins
yeah but uh is uh english
so mm
oh
well i don't know
uh
i don't know
i am not sure who was programming this calculator you know
'cause uh
i wonder if we put a. or b. somewhere instead of a number
no no no
mm let's try
let's finish this meeting instead
and we can discuss all these things in our party
okay
i save it uh
what else
okay so next mm
no
this is right
no that's yours
sorry
okay so finance that's done
'kay
are the cost under twelve
mm yeah very much
yes
project evaluation good
okay
so now
next slide
project process
we have to make um
safe uh asse uh safe assessment
yeah
yeah
mm
see mm how are we a good team
mm
yeah i think we've listened to everybody
okay
mm-hmm
everybody could say what they thought
mm
and uh
is there enough room for creativity
yeah yeah
yeah yeah
mm
and you
yeah
yeah
when we see the results there is no doubt there maybe a lack of leadership
yeah it's really
mm
oh
okay
well project evaluation
yeah
m maybe not huh
team work very strong i would say
yeah our team work is really strong
team work no problem
means
whiteboard digital pens
oh we still i guess
what was the oh yeah what was good
everything
yeah i think white board is useful
what was bad
digital pens useful
hmm
new ideas found
so you say is there sheep
yeah
luck
okay
so luck but good
which imply good uh team performance
but uh
yeah but uh then i i mus
yeah
a good leader you know a good leader is somewhere in the shade and
that's true
and there's uh one very important point
don't really
we're on time
yeah
mm-hmm
meetings finish when they have to or even before
and we also
mm
we made mm
the for meeting it's uh one of the most important thing
of course
uh
okay
mm
not to waste time that's important
yeah
yeah we have other uh remote controls to create
hmm
we need time f
okay
ah we got new idea speech recognition location finding
a lot of uh
new materials
mm
new materials new s uh this fancy strawberry design
yeah uh new ways of doing financial
mm yeah
hey just wondering if my uh what about the the pink the pinkness of that uh
and new tricks
mm
mm
they're working on um pink titanium
they are working on a okay good
ah very
i think we are great
budget
there's no no other words for that
yeah
we are probably the best
alright
mm yeah
real reaction is uh yeah
yeah we're really nice
yeah
yeah
mm
finished
okay
i think it's
ah celebration
are the costs within the budget
of course they are
yeah
yeah
yeah
uh how yeah
okay
is the project evaluated
yes it is
yeah yeah it's we got two good score
yeah it is
mm
so we see we can even forecast
they propose us like celebration everything we could forecast it right
to whom
to the whole our company
oh okay
i'm the one proposing the celebration
of course you know i'm the program manager
you
it was you
okay
so let's celebrate
uh
mm-hmm
so where we will go now
ah um i think it's finish
uh ye will go to italian restaurant or
i think the meeting
the meeting is over at least
yeah
mm
so we have to go out
ah okay
we can decide
mm mm
okay
yeah
and we go to the party
yeah
yeah yeah yeah
thank you
thank you to you
mm
hmm
good morning everybody
good morning
good morning
good morning
so we are asked to
to make uh uh a new remote control for television
and the characteristics of this new remote control should be original and
trendy and of course user user friendly
so people can can use it without any
any problem
i don't know
well i think we should set the the points to to drive the project and uh
mm
b did you send us an email about this
uh not yet but if you want
yeah we we received an email about this uh d designs
do you want do you want me to send you a mail
ah it's okay
or
or you can put it in the shared folder
yeah you see the email
you email
the v very no no the first one
no i didn't get it
it's inside
uh
this one
no no
no
the third one
oh you didn't get anything
no
it's strange
mm
i got an email about the dis about the discussion
yeah
you get email
i dunno from who
yeah from the account manager
from the account manager
you have received the same email right
yeah
yeah
i think it's for your guys to how to design it all the aspects so you need that information
yeah
yeah i think so
yeah so each of us has a role to do
yeah i think assign your uh roles
s
in each
we already have our role
for each for each one
for each person yeah
'kay we can
so there are so we have three f yeah
so there are three kinds of designs that's all
we have functional design conceptual design and detail design
okay alright
so who will be the the responsible for the functional design
any any volunteer
i think our uh responsibilities will be assigned when we in our mail we received from the account manager
yeah yeah
uh
i'm doing the interface
you are doing th
no i'm doing the interface
are you using the you are doing the in
yeah i i'm i'm
well maybe we have okay so i industrial design
it was a little confusion about my uh but it's alright
ah
okay
okay i'll for industrial design
yeah
okay
and and you
norman
mm
um working on i
user
user interface
and
and
uh i'm into marketing
doing the marketing
yeah nothing much in the project
nothing related here to the
marketing in this design
a design is basically for industrial design and the user interface
yes
you see the second mail
yeah it's inside
go down
appendix
yeah this is
see there's a role for everybody
yeah that's right first
even for the marketing
us user define
next
but look at your role your marketing role
there's a trend watching
i don't know
yeah that's your role
i
well i think we can have a little discussion about what has to be done and what are your ideas about the
about the design or
maybe we'll discuss this later no
well w we want to have a new re remote control for for t. v. distribution i guess
mm-hmm
so we have to plan how how it would be developed and uh
yeah
mm
how we can make it work
yes
i mean working remotes we already have
this will be something different from the other remotes remote controls
yeah i dunno i
what we we have to keep in mind the these characteristics
and of course it should not be very costly
yeah that's right
so
yeah
mm-hmm
well i i think that norman and i would think about um the technical points and um we should discuss it in the next meeting or
need to collect information
yeah
about the about what
um
i i'm part of design perhaps
uh what is most important in a
in a remote control
what is the most important function aspect
uh
you mean the external or
well you have to make it work
yeah of g of course
that's alright
that's the that's the big thing
yeah it should be easy to work with
yeah
yeah
yeah
we can think about an interface with uh well
uh
we maybe you can have a speech uh recognition interface
you just tell the television i want which channel
or or you can say for example um
you won't
i want uh to list all the programme tonight
y you know instead of uh remote control it's doing the some searching for you so you don't have to look for the channel you want
just say maybe i just want to press i wanna have a button for all the movies tonight
or a button for all the magazines all the information documentary tonight
and then you list a few and i will choose from the list
so instead of pressing the channel number i am choosing the programmes directly
yeah yeah
yeah that's one way of uh making it useful
i i think if we include a lot of technology on the remote control it will be very costly
no because no it's not very a lot
s
th this information exists
for example you can get um
like s uh you you you say we can use speech
you can use uh well for example anything
the the idea of using speech to reduce the button but uh and it's more natural
i
i think if you want t to choose uh from a list of programme or or something like that you you may have to to use uh w uh i dunno
yeah
i'm a okay
yeah
yeah
i mean the main uh function of remote control is to have something in the hand and we should be very careful about the size of the remote control
in the hand
yeah
yeah
yeah
if we are going to add a speech interface
yeah
i'm not sure with trendy slim size of the remote control it would be able to put a speech recog if you want to put a speech recognition system f interface for that i think the t. v. itself could have it
yes possible
yeah
yeah
but
and i could talk to the t. v. television itself
except if if you are far from the t. v.
i need not have an
yeah
i mean we have some or something different technology but
this is it's
yeah yeah
but th the main idea i wanted to s i wanted to say is that um there should be a function instead of choosing the ch t. v. channel
there's a option you can choose either t. v. channels or or pr or the or the contain or the contents of the programme
on the content
mm-hmm yeah
yeah
yeah it's it's a good idea it's a good idea but i i think that technically it would be um a little bit uh uh more tricky to to achieve this than just to
so it's more powerful
mm-hmm
yeah
no
no because you see now all the t. v. programmes are available on the webs
they they are they are they are available in x. m. l. format or whatever the format
we don't care
we just say that this are some content
we just want to retrieve the content and then classi sort them by the types of programmes
some of the websites they already provide this service so we can just use the service available
yeah yeah
download it uh to the to this remote control
and then there's there are only six buttons for six categories or sev seven
mm
the most there are only seven buttons
so i just choose the category one and you reuse the same button for example to to choose among the the sorted list the programme you want
so you don't have to choose among hundred channels if you have hundred channels you just have six buttons seven buttons
yeah we should also optimise the the number of buttons
well i i i i think that j just by using navigation buttons and the user interface on the screen we are able to uh navigate uh through the
yeah yeah
this is good idea
yeah
ah yes
so
well channel programme or contents or in an easy way so
yeah
yeah so you don't have to display here just display on the t. v. screen right
yeah in the dis display on the t. v. screen and just uh with the with your remote control would just navigate through the f
good idea
okay
i think i think that will be revol revolutionary
because all the t. v. uh the the remote control have all numbers lots of buttons and then you dunno what to choose in the end
yeah yeah
yeah
so
alright
i think for for the technical points we have to to to check how to gather the data from programme or contents and all this stuff
okay
so we have five minutes to
ah w w we have sometimes to use the white board
ah you can y you can you can use it if you so can we
five minutes
and another interesting idea for this would be to have an light adaptation system depending upon the picture of
okay
okay
so i mean if you're watching a movie and suddenly there is a dark uh some dark scene the lights adapt themself
yeah
yeah
s
the lighting in the room changes
yeah but we are designing just remote control
you it
i mean we have a option in the remote control
if we want to have that option you press that button in the remote
okay
oh right so
okay do you want to have a conceptual remote control there or you just want to put the function in
yeah
if if you you you can if you want you can use th the
please norman draw uh
go on draw something
oh i'm afraid you forgot to put your lapel
mm
where is it
the lapel
or before the before the the design that says
ah okay
where where is it
here
yeah that one
just plug it
norman
yeah that's right
mm
be before before writing you can uh sit and that says what we what we said then after that you can you can use the
mm
okay alright
so so the most functional des mm the most important function is to ch choo buttons to choose the content
yeah
right
we agree on that right
okay
uh uh first one is to uh buttons i or it could be anything with buttons
okay
yeah
uh to choose
uh content s or channels
so we have both
the user can choose w which one they want right
yeah by content or by channel it's a good idea
by content or by channel
choose by contents or by channels
so
and then what did we say just now
other than this
and uh we we have to find a way how to gather information about the contents
mm
okay so technically how the problems that how to do it is to how to get the content
yeah
challenge
i think i it's not very difficult to to browse by channel but it's a little bit tricky to browse by contents so
okay
content
okay so these we have to work it out
so this one of the problem
and uh
i think that's the the things to do and uh to uh
the main thing
okay
alright
reflect about it and uh
alright okay
so we are we'll discuss it we will get some information in the next meeting so for now we get uh the funct this is the functional designer
discuss it in the next meeting
that's the first aspect
right
we will get information and then we'll come back in
okay
thank you everybody
okay
yeah we'll come
so maybe we'll meet in maybe five minutes
and we'll discuss the other other aspects
alright
alright okay
okay
thank you mis
okay
well thank you all
so we come again for the the second meeting
mm-hmm
uh for the aim of this
meeting
now is to
to make presentation about
uh the work for each one
and take the the decision about the the design and the functionality of the the remote
okay
control
okay
and we have think i got a new project requirement
so i think
uh teletext becomes outdated
so the popularity of the since the popularity of the internet and i think we don't need lighting adaptive
okay
so the remote control should be only used for the the television
and of course we should have our image
in the in the design
so let's start with the
the industrial designer
yeah alright
so uh
or y you can use the whiteboard if you want
well i have a powerpoint pr presentation stored in my
here
in my personal folder so i i i think you can reach it from here
just go to explorer
or open
oh okay
participant two
participant two
this one
yeah
open uh
uh open
do you want to open
because it's open you mean
right so um i will talk about the the w working design and
f. five
slide show view slide show
ah
and um well i i will present my my first idea on how to build the our new remote control for television
so uh can you go one page down please
so i think the first things to do is to define the hardware components neededs to achieve uh what we want to do
so uh mm i'm thin uh i think uh i i'll do a survey about what is uh what is available on the market and what what is the the cheapest possible things we hav we can use
then uh i will try with the technical team to to build a prototype and to see uh with uh h how this little box would uh look look like
and how an and we can uh start troubleshooting first uh com communication problems or things like that
and when we are ready with this first prototype i i think we can add some software functionalities on a programmable chip like browsing by content or um things like that
okay so can you go down uh
so
wha what i think for now is we don't want to have a remote control w which is wired so uh i think we u we can use a battery for the
then two programmable chips for both software functionalities and communication
and the communication with the t. v. set is uh made through uh infrared communication
so uh this is the the schema of the o of the future uh remote controls so uh you can you can see the components
did you draw it
wow
uh battery and uh the two chips goes to the infrared uh connection to the t. v. set
this
this
what is the other chip for
the one on top
the one on top is for the um well the functionali the functionalities and the the th red um sorry the green one is is to well
one is a communication
putting things together um f transform the data into uh qu into the format to to uh to communicate with the t. v. set
for men
to the in
okay
and that's it
i think we should use a f. p. g. a. for for the functionalities which is easy to to t
mm
what is f. p. g. a.
it's field programmable uh something array
gateway arrays
yeah
it's a field programmable gateway arrays
so why's it how is it different from the bluetooth
well uh a f. p. g. a. is just a chip you can uh you can pr programme it uh wi with wh whatever you want
yeah
programme it
yeah
okay
and uh well the bluetooth chip is just responsible to uh make the communication uh between uh the two devices
yeah
uh
so this are the they have to work together
or
do they have to work together or two separate choice
no
well th the f. p. g. a. will produce the the data to send
okay
or it's something like isn't hardware the first one
and the second one is for the software
is the is the software par alri okay
yeah to run th to make it run
yeah
that's it
okay okay
so you can control if you want right
yeah
no
alright and that's it for the working design
so if you have any questions
mm
okay and how about the battery power
uh you mean that battery would be somewhere there and the remote contro the power to the battery comes through infrared
uh no no no no i think uh we have uh to to uh have uh embedded uh b batteries in in the yeah into the t
into the more compact and uh okay
yeah yeah
and uh i i don't think it will need um very uh much power to make it run so
mm
mm
yeah yeah
okay
mm
you can put it on the charger when uh you when you don't need to use it
yeah
it's a good idea
yeah that's right
yeah
having a charger rather than putting the battery cells always
yeah yeah
yeah
people don't like it to have to buy the batteries when they run out
yeah
mm
we just make a small charger and put it
uh mm
y yeah yeah
because you are using because you are using bluetooth if some people have p. d. a. they can use their p. d. a. to control the t. v. if they want to right
that's a good idea
you can i yeah
ma
also but but i i i think uh the the goal is to sell our remote control
bu
i dunno
yeah we can change the b
our remote we do not want to make it p. d. a.
yeah
s okay so charger for is the
um
so is mine
it's mine
oh
participant one no
yeah this your
mm
oh we have so let's move to
to user interface design
yeah
so you can open uh three
participant
yeah
so
so i'm working on the technical functions design
can you show the next slide
so the the purpose is to to find uh the important questions to ask is what effect should the apparatus have
so so i found on a webs on the internet yeah
during the weekend
i spent a lot of time searching and uh and i found that uh the function of remote control is to send messages to television set
that's good
mm-hmm
g
for example switch on switch off switch the next channel and so on and so on
so i found two very good prototypes for for this interface from our competitors so can you
this are usual functionality
yeah yeah yeah
ours is a bit uh different
so these are two example
one is from the other one is from yeah uh engineering centr yeah
tasks
this is the most competing prototypes i've found
but then uh loo but then i found if you look at you see on the left one there are too many buttons
and they are small
yeah
o on the right i tried to play with the problem is that uh if i have hundred channels i have uh i have to choo press the other button to choose the hundred channels and i have to compose the number so it's very lousy
yeah
of course
mm-hmm
so you so you move to the next the next one
yeah so i talk about the problem
and then i i look at the user manual they are a hundred pages thick so we don't want that
yeah
so i propose the easy to use uh prototype
you can navigate on t. v. screen and we can the user's preference and we need to have the t. v. connected to internet so we end in order to access the t. v. programmes by x. m. l. and we need some to do some preprocessing
from the technical aspect the processing should be done on the t. v. set than on the on the remote controller right
and then we the speech recognition as uh harry says we may just put in we may k. i. v.
what do you mean by the pa pa processing will be done on the t. v.
yeah all the processing is done the t. v. is a compu has some processing power the
than the
so we have to t
so we should have specific t. v.
yeah
or
we have to sell a t. v. with the remote control too
we can use this
yeah we don't
yeah because are you just wondering what controller okay
yeah i think so
yeah not the t. v. s
j j just the remote control
i think there there is there is al there there is a a technology like show view who is already available on most of the t. v. set on recorders or thing like that and we can try t to get this information on to the remote control to to do the processing on the remote control because
yeah
okay
yeah
yeah
okay
yeah that's right
so i the processing on on the remote controller so it can u be used in any t. v. any conventional t. v. sets
mm
yeah we
yeah
mm
okay
speech recognition
n yeah that's all
the next one
so i come up with a simple design just keep the v navigation buttons
yes that's a good idea i think
keep the navigation but
we d we don't we we don't need really much buttons to i if we have a screen to navigate on on the t. v. so uh
yeah
yeah
well f four five buttons it's sufficient
yeah
mm
it's easy to build
yeah that's right
it does not consume much power
okay that's all
oh but you have a catch there
um assume that um if you want to go to if you are watching channel two and if you want to go to channel ninety nine
then
well then y you you go to the main menu and uh you have uh go to channel and then uh you can
mm
mm
no because you choose by channel so you choose by t. v. program so you don't have hundred channels to choose from
yeah
uh-huh huh-huh huh
maybe you
mm-hmm hmm-hmm
if you go by channel you don't have to do that
but uh i i think i i if you if you want to to make uh well a a big jump but uh well you you have to to have a a a device when you could you could
but
so you are
ah
ah a big jump
yeah then yeah that's right
a mouse or
well not a mouse but uh something that that says more clearly that uh right left up down
yeah
mm-hmm hmm
well the to have the ability to to to write something to the navigator maybe directly or
okay
mm
okay
so we can think of buttons like in the telephone to send messages or things like that
mm
mm-hmm
but we'll see
how the this remote
uh it's gonna be small
yeah of course small
yeah
so it'll beep if you wanna find it you just uh shout y h just it just has to re respond to you when you look for the device
too small that it goes under the sofa and we can't find it
yeah that's
i dunno how bu
just give it a name and we call him
and responds to you and
yeah that's right
yeah that's right
okay so uh next presentation
participant four
so harry
okay after having the inputs from industrial design and user interface i think most of the points which i want to are already covered here
mm
and to find the most interesting features what the users would be interested
then what we have done is we have put a feedback forms in all the magazines and the users send the feedbacks and based on that
these are the findings which we got and yeah adding of a speech interface is always good for a t. v. remote but the technology
we already know that as discussed earlier
well i i think it will be a yes a bit complicated to um make a speech recognisers runs on the small uh ts
an it does how feasible it is
i mm
but i think if you to recognise numbers it's a well studied problem
i if you just recognise uh numbers is a limited you have limited vocabulary
oh we can put an limited vocabulary as in the mobile phones
yeah
we just have the
and this can allow to choose the the program for instance without uh adding uh buttons
mm
yeah
so it's a good idea
it's not going to take much space also
it's going to be very slim
mm
and next one was the size of the remote control
mm
it has to be of course a very slim and small one
and of course most of the people are interested in if it's less expensive so this is an important criteria here is
mm
mm-hmm
but
but do you think what they sug suggested s possibility
i mean we have to look for a trade off
mm
the features and the cost
yeah
i no i i think that uh i if we go for quality people may tolerate for high quality and of course comes with uh reasonable cost
yeah
maybe not less but they may be willing to pay
little bit more if it's with extra features
little bit more for comfort yeah extra features
yeah
it
yeah
yeah s s speech is a important extra feature i think
okay
yeah yeah
mm
that's right
but is it useful or not u
yeah
well uh
i don't know
there is in the
i mean for a lazy guys they could say nine and the nine channel comes
mm
or they say movie name or i don't go for movie names but only for the numbers on the channel
or volume up volume down brightness contrast
mm
mm
mm
so i think this should be a good idea to put this features
and the fourth one was the teletext in various languages
well
we are we we just have to find a mean how to to add a m a a a microphone or uh well yes a microphone into the the remote control
mm i think
so
i well it will be alright
i think i
what is the teletext
if it's necessary can you can do that
mm
we can integrate small microphone in the remote so it's not really a problem
yeah
okay
what about lighting adaptive options
yeah as discussed in the earlier meeting but i think uh not much people are really interested in this point if it's not really required
according to the re to the new requirements i think we don't need that
yeah
it is interesting but we are only concerned with the remote controller
mm
so you need s special t. v. sets to do that
or it's it's done via this remote controller
it's very complex
i mean
yeah i think it's a bit complex too
i mean yeah it's for the um industrial design and users interface designers to decide if it's going to be working or not
mm
for our next product our new t. v. set with uh automatical uh sound adjustment light
i think
yeah then we can conclude that
yeah
yeah but it's quite possible but maybe not in this project
so we have i think we have s still we have
couple of minutes
mm mm
so any things to
to discuss
i think as i discussed th that four points would be good for um marketing
or any suggestions
the speech interface and uh less uh reasonable uh cost
expensive
price
mm
and the lighting adaptation and the teletext
mm
and regarding the teletext uh these are the subtitl these are the text information which you got on the televisions
okay
if you are watching an foreign movie you get subtitles sometimes
yeah
okay
and uh if you are a french guy watching an english movie you would like to have it in french
mm
and if i am a german then i would like to have the my options in german
so the remote it should have some it should give me some flexibility of choosing the ch languages
function
that should be a good uh point
yeah but well what about the the new project's requirement
i i i think we should give up with teletext no
i think we we can we
is the
yes
well so maybe we we can j we can already think uh about a way to to access the internet via the television
mm
because if
using the t. v. to access the internet
or what
i didn't quite understand
yeah but uh we can think that in a few years there will be t. v. set that can access the internet
yeah
yeah okay
so it's a good idea if i i if we i if if we uh think about how to to to build up our remote uh control w with this functionality in a w which will c which will come in a few years
we already have some
so if we already have it in our remote control
so you have to anticipate the the future
yeah
yeah
the future demand market demand
yeah
yeah that's right
yeah to desi well not not to implement it but to well
to find a way to to add to add this functionality in a yeah in an in an easy manner if is possible
the functionality in the future
in future
alright
yeah
because all the t. v. sets will be digital right
all the programmes everything will be in digital than analog
th the system will change and we have to anticipate for those change
yeah yeah
yeah
okay
okay
so
so let's go for the the lunch break and
okay thank you
we will meet after
okay thank you
okay
thank you
so we come to the third meetings
i have
good
um so in the last meeting we have discussed the functional design and now we will talk about the conceptual design
so we
okay so i think i will do my presentation on the components concept so can you please uh open uh
will talk about some
specific details
i'm participant two
components design
this
okay so uh the first thing uh i have done is to to made a review together with the uh manufactural uh department and have which components was uh available to build a remote control
so for energy sources we have we have to choose between the solar energy
hand dynamo and uh kinetic um well uh kinetic uh technique to to store the energy
we also um we also can put a regular battery in the in the remote control
now
uh this is what we have decided in the last meeting
but if we use battery
yeah b uh f well uh i meant uh by by battery i meant uh i will not have a uh a wire between the remote control and the energy source but uh i didn't fou we didn't decide yet which kind of battery
we will put inside the the remote
so uh it's a point to discuss
then uh the case material we have uh uh also several choices like wood rubber titanium or latex
but uh well
it's not a a re uh well a real issue for the from the technical uh point of view
concerning the interface uh we can we can put mm just simple buttons or scrolls or buttons uh much more complicated
but it also requires that the chip to process the button is more complicated so
mm
and uh this is the last point the choice of chips
so what i have f found is that i think basic battery or kinetic uh energy uh collection is the is the better way to provide energy because i think solar energy wi won't work in a cluttered uh uh environment
mm
so um so i think we can start with these two main things
for the case uh well uh i think that uh titanium is um is a good choice because it's trendy and it's uh it's uh well it's modern and uh user are are are mm will be uh very happy to have a a a nice remote
for the interface uh i think that we can ach achieve uh all the desired functionalities by s just uh using uh rubber buttons
simple buttons and th thus this allow to use a regular chip that are uh well cheaper
mm
and s so uh we can move to the next slide
sorry
yeah
what is this single curved what does it mean
well uh uh i i it's uh it's the the shape of the um of the remote
so it's it's not
you you will have the well um the the curve will fit into your hand when you grab the
yo l yeah
when you hold on it it is comfortable to hold
yeah
it's more confog f comfortable that if these uh it's completely flat
okay
yeah
and the battery is it kind of a rechargeable or it doesn't matter
yeah the um that's the point
the kinetic one is uh y you can recharge uh by the um
that that's what it means by kinetic
yeah and by well by just by moving the ar uh your arm the mm well the remote will uh accumulate energy
okay
mm-hmm
okay
but i d i don't know it's if it is feasible because i don't know if yet if if the user will move enough to provide the remote um all the necessary energy
mm
mm
okay
yeah
yeah
we we might check with our r. and d. department to see if they have this product ready for market
yeah
and yeah and so can you go to the next slide please
so and uh that's uh that summarize well what i have said
mm mm
so uh you're right we can uh see in our uh r. and d. uh if the kinetic metal is sufficient to provide enough energy
wha
ah the department
mm
that's it
uh
so i um keep in touch with the r. and d. department
oh yeah i take care it's all right
so the titanium case is the normal case that i'll show you some pictures that i have and you tell me whether they are titanium case or not
all right
'cause i am not very sure plastic titanium or whatever
yeah
there's another point i want to make
is that the uh well you've seen them i le na my presentation that um i point out some why buttons are not the mm
not the only ways you can use
yeah
yeah maybe n
we will okay
three
yeah
so the user interface is uh
i it uses the aspect uh of a computer system a programme which can be seen or heard
or otherwise perceived by the human user and the commands and mechanism
the user uses to control its operation and input data
so you s this gives you the ways to input data and we have uh we are more we emphasise more on the graphical user interface here
the idea is to represent buttons as figures diagrams
symbols and on so you you can easily when you look at the symbols you understand what it is doing
what's the function of this button
yeah
yeah
so
i think it makes the the interface really
ea easy to use
so next one
graphical user interface
function five
so i can use the button the mouse maybe
a graphical user interface emphasise the use of pictures
yeah
so next line
so the here are some examples
so they cluster the buttons together
they group them into col they colour them and uh they have different forms as well
mm
but this interface are kind of confusing
uh basically there are too many buttons
right
next one
yeah
so some people are propose voice recognition and
so ah by the way i receive an email from the from one our departments saying that the voice recognition has been used in the coffee machine for this by a company when you tell the you say good morning coffee machine and the machine are reply to you
mm-hmm mm mm
so i just got an email saying that
and it seems like this voice recognition technology is ready to be used so we might consider that
yeah fine
supposedly
the next one
mm so somebody some people use uh some people use a spinning wheel th with the l. c. display so instead of using the mm buttons you have a l. c. d. screen and then there you can u you can use that as buttons
you can use that as real so so that could be an option as well
touch screen i mean
yeah
next one
and some people propose a scroll button
integrated with push buttons or you may have scroll button instead of p just the push button
like the one we have here
uh next one
so
mm
mm-hmm
so there are a few aspects that i collected here
so s basically this deals with special users children handicapped people
old people and uh
mm and prog basically they are programmable specially for children
and uh
mm yeah yeah
and then they also secure uh covers to protect
uh secure and hidden programming and battery covers that will protect your settings
so
but we don't have to integrate all these complicated features
i'm just saying that the currently in the market there are there are control there are remote controllers f customisable for different people
yeah so that's the point
the next one
and uh you see this is the one where you have the protection cover
mm maybe useful for children they migh you you they only see the buttons outside
and for adults wh where you have more control you can see the one inside
so the adults might wanna have a key to lock that to pr so children will not touch the button inside
yeah
yeah
s a good idea
the next one
so this guy this is another company that provides big buttons
at i see that that is useful for old people and then you don't get it lost
but for our product we don't need a big one because you have voice recognition e eventually with use
yeah
and you can call your remote controller if you don't know where it is
t. v. remote controller where are you
and then he will beeps and to say that i am here for example
we should include speech synthesis in this case no
is it possible
yeah
yeah
uh
yeah but uh as norman say if uh there is uh already a commercial product available who t who do this we we can check uh to integrate it i into our uh new remote control
yeah
yeah
yeah
yeah
yeah
and uh this is another one where you can uh the the the part that's a v. standing for the volume
so there's a up arrow and a down arrow
but you the see that in the v.
the v. appears to be the down arrow on the top on the top up arrow if you up arrow there's a v. like as as if it's turning down so it's confusing interface
mm-hmm
so i wanna avoid this kind of thing in the design
yeah yeah
and here are is uh here is a s short summary that i summary that i compiled after the findings i found
big buttons are convenient voice recognition helps push buttons scroll buttons spinning wheels can be used as navigation tools
and uh user customisable is important and finally simplicity simplicity is the key
yeah
so we have many concepts there but we have to choose later on which ones are important to be used
hmm
yeah
and basically uh
well i i think you it's it's it's fine you have uh reviewed all all the possibilities but uh uh well uh i if we consider that uh the user interface is displayed on the t. v. screen i don't think we nee uh we need much buttons in the remote since we we just have to navigate and to have a okay or enter key or things like that
yeah
mm-hmm
yeah
mm
because uh adding wheels or scrolls uh makes the thing more complicated and more expensive also so
mm
okay
or maybe we can include the user manual in the in the remote control and we should have just a button like help and you say uh and you ik you press the button help and maybe you see the the user m might in the in the t. v.
yeah
that's a good idea
to have a help button
a help button
yeah
yeah
so you are display on the screen
on the t. v. screen
on t. v. t. v. screen
so on the t. v. screen
on the t. v. screen the uh how to use your remote
so just you push the button and we will
okay
okay
oh
okay
so that eliminates all the complicated documentation okay
yeah
so wi
but people are often enough looking at the help once they see the help button they say oh this is a complicated stuff
if the if
no in the case where they need help in the case where they need help
uh yeah
it's a psychology
in a marketing point of view
okay
and let us see what the market demands
yeah
we could just go to my presentation
yeah
but uh wel well i think
it's just for user customizable for kids or old people
yeah that's right
mm
i mean it just showed us the remote with an cap which could be used for kids and if you remove the
so
so it's the same
same remote with some
can be used by both kids and old people
both yeah
mm
well uh what i s propose is that uh you know a remote controller i it could be a cube
is uh a small device that uh looks like a cube and maybe you can just change the um the buttons
if you ch turn one side you get one one buttons you turn the other side you get the other buttons
so for maybe new generation people who get used to the computer they want lots of controls
maybe for kids kids they like uh t no l they like to
small
uh well
so le le let's see what uh what people want
yeah
let's see the market demand
and then we can decide what what we can yeah
what what market yes yes
so
we just made an marketing survey of what people need from our remotes and how it could be special from the other remotes
and we got the best on the responses from the questionnaires
uh we also have some prizes for the most creative solutions
and we found the following solutions which we could which would be helpful for our design
so seventy percent of the users they find their remote controls very ugly they don't find it pleasant to use in the size or usage or anything
and eighty percent of the people they are always l i mean they are willing to spend more money
if the remote control would look fancy
and the current remote controls do not match well the operating behaviour of the user
and seventy five percent of the users
said they zap a lot
and fifty percent say they use only ten percent of the buttons so the rest of the ninety percent of the buttons they're not used most of the times
yeah
yeah
mm-hmm
yeah
yes
so this were the findings which we found
and also they cited frustrations with the present remote controls
most of fifty percent of the time the remote controls are lost somewhere in the room and people are always searching for them rather than watching the t. v.
yeah
and by the time they found the remote control the program is finished
so they're frustrated a lot
yeah
and um if the remote control is too complicated it takes much time to learn the functionality of it
mm
mm the functionalities yeah
so you can just see the percentage
fifty percent people they responded that they always lose their remotes and thirty four percent they say that it's quite difficult to learn if it's too complex
yeah
so keeping in view all these findings and the frustrations i think this should be the solution for them
we should have an l. c. d. on the rem remote control
oh
well mm w well i i i don't really see the advantage of having uh l. c. d. on the on the remote control if we have a a a big screen and uh display on the screen
big screen
it's yeah of course it's fancy trendy and so on but it's it's expensive to produce and it's not really
mm-hmm
yeah
i mean as our survey says that people are willing to pay more if their remotes are fancy
yeah
so if we have a l. c. d. on the remote rather than looking onto the t. v. you just look into a remote and navigate it
it's the same menu as we have saw that ipod remote control
mm yeah
yeah yeah
mm
we just play around
the thing
yeah but when you play with the ipod you don't have a big screen in front of you s
yeah
yeah
you can use this screen instead of the big se screen instead of use the yeah
yeah
yeah
if you re use the existing screen we element eliminate the l. c. d.
after all the l. c. d. just to display and if you have the colourful screen you can make the display colourful
hmm
fancy as fancy as the one on the l. c. d. maybe even better
yeah
yeah
so
i mean this were the points which we got from the market demands
yeah
yeah
yeah yeah
so
yeah
so i th i i well i think we we can focus on the uh on the fancy look on the uh
the other one
yeah
more on a fancy design
yeah that's fine
yeah
on the speech recognition if the technology is available but well i think l. c. d. will uh will uh make us spend a lot of money for not so big results
i mean that's
yeah
mm
remember we have a s budget for the cost of producing the remote controller
mm-hmm
but
yeah
yeah
uh yeah we have uh
so i is so the thing is you can find out how much an l. c. d. will cost and then we'll decide again
i mean that should be found out by the industrial designers
uh maybe you can find out the price and tell us next time
so price of uh l. c. d. display
is i if i
yeah
and it's always good to have an voice recognition for the remote controls
and
yeah
and also the cost for the speech recognition
mm
yeah
ask our r. and d. department
it's for it's just for small vocabulary
yeah
yeah it's o only for a limited vocabulary say eighty commands or so
we it's not yeah
yeah
and ho
yeah
yeah
yeah okay
and also the scroller button how much will it cost
and
well uh compared to the to s the simpl simpler simplest button
yeah
mm the scroll button from the survey we never see that people would like to have some scrolling button
push push
yeah
because they they just they're just frightened to use the scrollings or help button
yeah i think that
yeah
yeah i i i think that uh well uh as we have seen in the in the presentation uh well uh about uh uh fifty percent of the of the percent n choose the button so uh i think to have uh five uh simple button is sufficient for our functionality
don't use the buttons
yeah
yeah
yeah
yeah
yeah
it doesn't mean that the other buttons are not necessary or important
important
yeah
but
but they are just less used compar yeah
they're not used much
but the uh the thing is is i is that we can add a functionality on the on the t. v. screen like uh a a list of function and then you choose with the with the button to well you navigate and you
yeah
yeah
mm
yeah yeah
so so the at most more power uh
or maybe we can u uh or maybe we can uh make this the ten percent of button more bigger than the others
yeah
so
but if i i if we if we could have a a a display uh g a user interface that is very complete on the t. v. screen i think that just five buttons are sufficient
yep
one to go up left right down and uh enter and you you you just select the functionality you want to access or things like that
yeah
mm
mm
yeah
you don't have to to switch to a channel to another uh
yeah
mm
or it could be like this as the people say if they have a l. c. d. on the remote not on the television
because when you have the l. c. d. onto the television screen you miss the picture in the background we are most focused on the commands
so if you have then l. c. d. in the remote you just have a menu
yeah but
and increasing and lower these signs here to change the programs and this menu when you press the menu
in the l. c. d. displays as you go on pressing the menu it faster displays volume then the program then the brightness contrast and all the stuff
mm
yeah but if you look at the l. c. d. you you don't look at the t. v. screen so i i it's not really worth to get to have the image if you don't look at
and accordingly you can just increase or decrease
mm
it's
mm
i if mm
mm
yeah
and i think it's increases the cost of the the remote control if you use l. c. d.
so
yeah
yeah that has to be checked out
i think that there's no contradiction here because if there are few buttons
i
you don't have to look at your your controller any more because you know where the buttons are
yeah
so if you wanna control the screen d sh sharpness you just say sharpness and then you t turn you just press lef increase or decrease button and the same for the volume and the channel
yeah
if you had the speech recognition there you just shout your channel
just tell your channel and then you don't even have to look at the butto at the controller so finally that wil eliminates the the need for l. c. d.
okay
with the help of speech recogniser you can yeah
i mean better if we could just check all the cost with l. c. d. and also with the speech recognition
mm
yeah
and then we could find which would would be a more suitable in this case
mm
mm
yeah
a and
and the third problem was to find the remote control
always so fifty percent of the people say they lose the remotes
so
well so we we can think about a well a a vocal command like uh find and when the remote control uh hears fine well yeah just uh to make him beep or t
mm
where yeah
you will listen to a peep special peep
yeah that's right that's exactly what i mean by voice commander
or it could be also something like this uh it's always boring to change the batteries of the remotes control
yeah
yeah
mm
yeah
so we have some one charger there and whenever we don't use the remote control we put it in the charger
put it back at the charge
put
yeah
and when we're using that t remote and if we misplace somewhere in the charger we have a small button
and just by pressing the button in the charger the uh remote control beeps wherever it is
yeah
yeah
okay
and that's a good idea that's simple like in phones
yeah
mm
i mean it doe it also doesn't require a voice command because there are problems with a voice command
yeah
but you don't you don't have to move the the charger
hmm
mm
yeah yeah yeah
i mean charger would be fixed because it's always with electricity plugged
th yeah
you have to keep it
yeah
mm yeah
yeah if there if there uh there is nuff not enough battery
yeah
okay
mm
mm
there's mm
also and uh uh the remote is lost
mm
yeah
yeah that's right
that we can what we can do is we can program a function whereby when you press the switch off t. v. button
the off button the remote there be s uh instruction on the screen please charge charge me
yeah
you never get it lost because uh every time you're off the computer the t. v. you are asked the the command the t. v. com remote controller would tell you to put it back to where to the charger
it's an good reminder yeah that's right
yeah
so you will never get lost yeah
okay
maybe for some people lazy people
yeah
yeah because everything is programmed inside
yeah yeah
so it's it's uh it's all about strategy y
and of course the final point is a fancy look
mm
as we have seen earlier the
remotes which were displayed by norman they weren't fancy i mean mm very big or something with lot of buttons
mm
they were ugly
yeah yeah
they
mm
i think we should have something it
well the last one with the um
with uh two two two parts controller
yeah with the two parts was uh original so
i mean uh i mean uh i mean uh you see if it's like that even a kid who wants to have a control he could just plug it and use it
yeah
you can't avoid him
but you can have an button for child lock
yeah
yeah
mm
so just by pressing the button with some code you t you put a lock onto the remote so that he can't use even
mm
mm
mm
well we can think about uh having uh on the on the on the user interface when you switch on the t. v. you can uh well write a code or choose a category
mm
mm uh
mm
or
mm
if it is kids uh things like that
yeah
that's right
mm
or maybe you have to to show some specific programmes for kids and then just just yeah just push uh kids button so it's automatically
mm
these are probl yeah
mm
mm
mm
so if he
i think these other four points they're the market demands and so it's for the user interface design and industrial design to just think
so for mm yeah
mm
yeah
so for my part i will check the prices the um the prices difference uh of what to use where to use and s uh and so on
yeah i think it should be clearer for us in the next meeting that th uh these could be included
yeah
mm
i think we need to define also a s the set of vocabularies for the speech recogniser
yeah
because uh if you want uh say we can sort by channels or sort by t. v. programs you have to decide a category of vocabularies for them
if numbers they're easy but if name the channel by by name
mm-hmm
well i think we can we can have just numbers for channels and you can say to your remote control like uh sports and then on the t. v. you have a list with with uh uh well with sports program playing now and and uh
mm
no we have a problem there
you see uh if you have a voice commands and you are s you are watching a score on uh basketball score or something
and if the score comes twenty four thirty five you've just say twenty five and suddenly the screen the channel goes to twenty five
yeah it's yeah
so i think there should be a prefix to some numbers
that's right yeah yeah
mm
well but well e every possible word uh has a probability to come about of the t. v. so
yeah
i mean the the you just check all the probability that saying t. v. twenty five and just ordinary twenty five
mm
yeah yeah
ordinary twenty five you almost there's a probability of being said around sixty seventy percent and t. v. twenty five
yeah but well okay
mm
i dunno it will be round about one or two percent
mm
mm-hmm
mm
so it's better to have some prefix before the number
but i i i think that the user would like wou would like to associate the channel or call the channel rather than than the numbers
yeah something some code
you say numbe channel number five of the t. v. correspond to something else in the channel
yeah yeah
so some people may want to say i want to see this channel
mm mm
well i
that will be too big
and it will be difficult for the vocabulary also
or just
yeah
check with the v r. and d. department the capability of recogniser
it's difficult to to just say the the name of the channel
uh
it will be difficult to say just the name of the channel
because you have to s t uh a ch yeah but you have to to have all the name of the channel in your vocabulary
well it's convenient for the user
als might be you just forgot the channel name you kno only know the number
or maybe
yeah
then
the uh uh mm
or maybe the user can create his own vocabulary just pronouncing the the name of channels and include in the vocabulary
mm
i i think that i have mm mm i think there's another way you can do is that uh you can uh if when the user ch press a button to choose the channel for example
then what you can do is that the you can make the t. v. screen to split them into small little little squares of images where you you you have a snapshot of every channel
so let's say it's a four by four matrix of the images
so now what you do is f looking at the all the sixteen channels available at one time
you just use the control button uh
you just you you just choose the the option you want and then you just hit the button and then you go to that channel
yeah the
so
or lets the user create his own vocabulary
mm
so you you don't use the speech recogniser in that way
of channel
no
just you have uh in the beginning you have
uh t you have to train you have to create the vocabulary by yourself
oh okay
yeah
well i uh i also
by associating each channel with the name or
i i also think about uh another problem
if if there is uh more than one person who is watching t. v. the s well the the speech uh r recogniser should be able to distinguish between the two
yeah yeah
and for each one has his own
because uh i remember when i was a young child with my sister we yeah we always want to w to watch different emission at the at the same time so it's a pr it could be a problem if uh if well if someone passes by when you are watching t. v. and say oh t. v. thirty and just run
mm
or you have to s
yeah i wanna watch this i wanna watch that
yeah
mm
s
a and in the same lines we would have a one more problem
if we are using the television in the different environments
say in the factories or in the shops where there is a lot of noise and this voice commands if they fail to work
yeah yeah
yeah
that would bring a bad name bad uh reputation for our company
mm
so i think we should specify some pre requirements if we want to use a voice commands
mm
say that it should be used in an silent homely environment or s something
yeah
or we can switch on or switch off the the special yeah
yeah that's right that should be an option
mm
yeah that's well i think that's a good uh a good option because it's simple and uh simple to implement also so
hmm
i think these are the practical problems
so we need to take care of them in the design
maybe we'll discuss them in next meeting
it's time to close this meeting
okay
well you you stay a five minutes
okay
oh it came there on three minutes back so we are i think we can just press the okay
yeah
okay
okay
so i see ya
thanks for your collaborations
okay
see you another thirty minutes
so in last meeting we have discussed the conceptual design and we asked you to prepare a prototype for the
okay
for the remote control
so
so let's see the what
yeah so can you go out to the shared folder
did you prepare
mm the shared folder
sh share folder for th your presentation
yes
we have a presentation
because i have here
uh
so i got the participant uh
three
w uh
three
it's the final design yeah
okay just one
s so so i discussed with guillaume
mm
yeah
right
and uh so we have and we we are both agreed on some two versions of the prototypes
because we were no not decided whether we wanted to have an l. c. d. or not because it's too expensive
so we come up with two versions
one with and one without l. c. d. s
um but both comes with a charger and then detachable and uh or control module
and detachable big buttons for all people um
s okay so i'll show you the the two prototypes
so
here we have the first one with the beautiful uh l. c. d. um display
you you can s here
and you can uh just um browse into the the navigation menu by uh joystick joystick like uh button
mm
you can uh choose the direction and if you just push on it it's considered like a enter function
mm
mm-hmm
you have on the mm on the side here the microphone for the for the speech recognition system here
and here the the switch that control if you want
why you why you you put it in the the side
well i i i think uh it's the
it's not a good place maybe
yeah but
no i i it's the all around camer uh microphone isn't it
the the microphone picks up
yeah
the speeches from anywhere
is it an only a single mic or a microphone array
well so it's a microphone array
oh it's very costly microphone array
mm-hmm
no it's just a single microphone
yeah
and you i i think uh we we put it here because i think when you when you are browsing your l. c. d. you will be close to well it's better to to to place it here th than here
yeah
mm
yeah yeah
okay
for instance
and here is a little switch that control if you want the the speaker uh recognition system to um to be on or off
and uh so this remote control comes up with its charger
how much does it cost this one
well this this prototype is um made for about uh well fi fi fifteen fifteen dollars fifteen dollars
for the
yeah
fifteen dollars
but uh well it's not it's not uh yeah but uh it's just a prototype and if we uh if we optimises the um the uh voila
ah it's above it's above the budget
the cost would be le reduced
yeah the and the the production costs we we can achieve uh about ten dollars
mm
hmm
how many b battery is there
how many excuse me
battery
well uh f battery we use uh about uh
is it n the two a. a. s batteries in it
yeah
a. a. rechargeable batteries
rechargeable of course because we have the charger
yeah rechargeable batteries
we have the charger so it's no problem
yeah and you just
so one one battery
on uh yeah one battery
is that two or one
it's kinetic reserve
actually uh it's a flexible thing
you just n uh
now what is the whole day rating for that
the excuse me
whole day's rating
what type of battery
oh yeah it's just a r uh simple battery a rechargeable uh if you uh like it's exist
yeah yeah
something like a two a. a. three size batteries
yeah
mm-hmm
yeah
so and if you want to charge the battery you just put the remote control like that to plug in the the charger and uh leave it uh alone
yeah
yeah
mm
it's alright
at uh yeah
then the next time you pick it oh
it works
i forgot to tell you there is only a single button there b this button yeah alright
yeah just explain the button uh norman
this button is like the mouse is like a joystick
you can move in three hundred and sixty degrees of direction so you can make a turn and it the additi functions associated to all the actions you ma you have a click you have a double click
mm
all in a single button
you can move up down left right or you can do a swing
so a swing to the left a swing to the right defines other functions
so even though it's a single button but it is pretty s flexible because of the three hundred and sixty degree movement
and the l. c. d. is this one on the remote
yeah
yep
this is the version y that comes with l. c. d.
yeah
here i present another version without the l. c. d.
i think it's not a good idea because after maybe one or two months
mm
of function is
getting destroyed
if you
uh okay this is new prototype uh
yeah it's
so we have the the second version also with the different uh button configuration
the second version is also simpler we d uh we had just uh i have to put the microphone also
yeah yeah
so basically th it's the same uh yeah
uh-huh and also the switch
okay
basically it's the same uh things uh uh as uh i presented before
but here we have uh we have uh four buttons for navigation
press one button uh acting as a a enter button
mm
so um yeah according to what you said it's more robust to the user
mm-hmm
mm-hmm
and uh it's also cheaper to produce
we can produce uh such remote control for about uh four dollars
no four dollars it's good
and i think you forgot a point here to have an button to find the charger because that's a major that's a
oh no th actually th we'll come to that point in our
yeah it's it's it's embed in the uh speech recognition system
yeah
okay and if you disable speech recognition system then
so
w w i'll i'll come to that point later on
mm-hmm hmm-hmm hmm-hmm
so norman will explain to you
and we will we will serve the charger with this
yeah
okay
yeah yeah of course mm
th they either these with the uh the the charger any in either versions you they they ha they use the same charger yeah
with the remote control
okay so the price of the charger included in the
uh it's a standard module so you should get it for a cheap price uh
thank thank you
mm-hmm
and so mm-hmm
it's that same charger that you can use for the hand phone but uh again depends on the types
i think we have to investigate more on that but
the price should be below twelve and a half euro
yeah
yeah but as the marketing manager says people is willing to people are willing to pay more for good design
well that's so
yeah people are willing to pay more but the company is not willing to invest more at the moment
we have we have just
yeah
the price of selling is twenty five euros
yeah
mm-hmm
and the price of
alright please uh go on norman with the special features
production
or uh
yeah we'll we'll come up to that
the the the thing that makes this the controller cheap is that it is modular so you want more function you pay more
if you want less function i i if you want a reasonable price you pay for the functions that you add on to the system so is uh modular
that's for this basis function and if you want more you pay more
yeah yeah for example the l. c. d. you can take it you can put it put it back in
something like customised
yeah
yeah
or you can use the other one or the speech recogniser with the microphone yeah yeah
you want a microphone to put in the speech recogniser you don't wan you pay less for the system you see
okay
mm-hmm hmm-hmm
so
hmm okay
it's pretty flexible in the yeah price
you also have the the the two other modules for the parental control
but
uh yeah yeah you should present that
and this is other one
that that you ca you can add up to the to your remote control i i if you uh if you want to to have more more power on what you do
yeah
and uh which channel you want to choose and so on
h here is just the the the module for the kids and th if the parents want to watch t. v.
mm-hmm hmm-hmm
up they come up with their modules they just plug in it and they can have all the control they want here
yeah
mm
we also have this module for uh old people with big buttons
hmm
clearly labelled and it acts like the previous one you just plug in and it works
yeah
yeah the i the idea the the conceptual idea is that
mm-hmm
simplicity and powerful
simplicity meaning that we have few buttons
powerful is that all the controls with the one you saw we saw earlier in the meetings with lots of buttons n but here you only have few buttons but you retain the mm the same powerful functionalities
but in addition with simplicity
so that's the best idea the cond that that's our uh an innovation um uh i in this uh design here
mm-hmm
okay now we come to other important features that i did not tell you
the first one is the speech recogniser again it's detachable or add on
and then we also have security feature for example this here oop it's very robust it doesn't break and the material what's the material again
the titanium and so it's very uh
titanium material
titanium
again uh and the battery life is uh is an is an endurable one again because this is a. a. batteries you can choose the types of battery you want
yeah that's fine
lithium ion may be a good one but you can replace it with cheaper one again you pay for what you get
and then um y the other p points are robust and misplacement reminder
so when you finish watching your t. v.
and you the you t you turn off the t. v.
uh and then there's this message coming out that uh please put that back to the charger so so that's the or is it that's the reminder part
okay
yeah and um
and it also use a programmable channel and vocabulary so we didn't define the vocabulary so it's up to the user to define so sorry
mm-hmm hmm-hmm
and then uh because of the chil because children are using the device so we have also a a of t. v. programmes by genre
and this can be used by the adult or by the children
so instead of choosing the channel you are choosing the t. v. contents of the night
so it's pretty powerful and that's that's why the num buttons are reduced because of this feature
yeah
and and for the materials that is cheap to produce i think uh it's quite clear from yeah
and also like the and the fancy designs yeah
maybe we can improve more on the design but uh this is the
what what's
maybe yeah
what's the price to p to produce
well so the price to produce
for uh the simplest one say we start from four dollars to produce such a device
uh it's about it
with with with the charge
the without without the charger it's about uh well two dollars to produce uh the microphone and speech recognition systems
with the charger
okay
yeah
two dollars for the uh for the add on modules and finally three dollars for the charger
so if you uh sum up uh everything
yeah
we don't have charger
wi with the l. c. d. which costs two dollar you have two plus four plus four plus two plus two
i think we can use excel
it's about so the total cost if you if you want all the fuct functionalities will be about uh fifteen dollars
we don't have all the options
charger we don't have charger here either
yeah
no it's
but it's just if you want all functionalities
it's below the the the budget
yeah
excuse me
it's below the bu
the budget
yeah it's a nice input but we have an
we
other inputs from the l public demands
i think we will just have a rough look and then we can make our statements and we can finalise the product based on this discu
yeah
yeah
i think we can just go to my presentation then
we can wind up
or we could uh come to some f uh final conclusions
so the marketing made an evaluation criteria and these were some of the findings and uh
in the market the people are not really interested with l. c. d. without l. c. d. with speech recognition interface or without speech recognition interface
but most of the people what they are interested is first thing is they want to have an fancy look and feel
it should be very fancy with colourful and uh very handy to hold
and the second thing is it should be much more technologically innovative
mm
of course in that we could put l. c. d. or recognition to be more technologically innovative
and the third one is easy to use
well i think that the technical in innovation is is in the product itself since we haven't yet a remote who are allowing to to choose interactively with the t. v. screen uh uh with just four buttons
mm
okay and if we go to the next slide here you can find these are the latest fashion updates
and so this in paris and milan they have detected this trends that the this year it's going to be an year of fruit and vegetable
so people are really interested to see if they have an remote in the shape of the fruit or a vegetable or whatever they like
spongy spongy
mm mm
so i think it should be much more customised to make a different uh shapes
mm mm
and the second thing is and if the material they really do not want it to be very hard
as in the case of very pl plastic or titanium it should be somewhat spongy
okay
but the the problem is that uh is it robust to mishandling
um
we have you should find a material that is robust at the same time spongy
a sponge
yeah so uh so finally we have these three criterias
spongy
one is fancy look second is
innovative and third is easy to use
so these are the f uh three criteria on which we are going to build our remote
mm-hmm
so and we have an evaluation criteria for each one of these say that we have a seven point scale
hmm
from one to seven and for each of the product you could just give me the scale according to this
mm-hmm
mm
so now you have with l. c. d. and without l. c. d. so on this scale if it is true
mm
if it is if it has a fancy look you could just tell me one or if it is false
it doesn't it looks uh it doesn't look much fancy then you could just tell me seven
so
so so is the e evaluation depending on us or other users
we can make our study on this and
no no we have you have designed two products now one is with l. c. d. and without l. c. d.
yeah
yeah
yeah
but who will give the scoring uh we ourself or or a third party
you
according to you no according to you designers how will feel does it uh with l. c. d. and without l. c. d.
mm
okay let us make this l. and without l. c. d.
on on this scale the l. c. d. remote control
mm
how do you look how does it look
mm
d is it very fancy or doesn't look much fancy
well it doesn't look much fancy i'll i'll say three or four
and you both agree for that
and you
i think we can improve on the design
yeah
som someone um commented this is like a the stone age uh design
it's it it
um we have been focused all all this time on the on the technical aspect functional aspect but also the simplicity
technical aspects
mm-hmm
as for the design maybe we c should hire a designer to help
so i take three on with l. c. d.
yeah a three
so without l. c. d. how would you rate it
yeah
uh four
four
i think it's it's uh more easy to make f fancy things when it's not complicated so
yeah
removing the l. c. d. um gives us a li more liberty to to have a fancy look
yeah
and in the sense of innovativeness with l. c. d.
well it's it's the same for both so i will give a five six
mm
five with l. c. d. and
well five also uh norman please
yeah from the innovation aspect i feel that uh what is most innovative
uh
of our prototype compared to the existing prototypes that we saw l in the last meeting
is that um the retrieval of t. v. programmes by content because uh that is really innovative
and for now and another innovation we have is simplicity and simplicity few buttons we've uh
with lot of functionalities
a lot of functionalities
so without l. c. d.
so that is uh that is uh for both th
our gi i think that the our our product is uh has the best in all well this is a biased judgement because we designed them
no no according to design aspect we want to know how would you feel the innovativeness
yeah
uh the innovation is v is very high i think
with l. c. d.
for l. c. d.
and without l. c. d.
both
mm for both it's the the same innovations
for both
it's the same innovation
okay
so maybe i can put six to seven
six let's go for six
without l. c. d.
both
no actually uh to make it with l. c. d. you make more efforts
so i there is high innovativeness included if you make it with l. c. d. y then when it is without l. c. d. there is not much innovativeness
yeah
mm
uh no innovative yeah
so we can't go
uh uh uh there w there was a there was a issue here is that what are what is the display on the l. c. d.
talk about
we haven't really uh determined what are actually actually it's good to have a l. c. d. but what are we gonna display on a l. c. d.
i mean that what you are sayin that's what the design
no it's like this i mean on the l. c. d. according to what i understand from your model is you have a joystick here
so let's remove it
yeah
and you have l. c. d. you just press your joystick you get here a programme
yeah
yeah but
yeah but you have the same programme on the t. v. screen
uh then
but
yes exactly
this is the problem
no on the t. v. you don't it doesn't display on the t. v. now
if you have the l. c. d. but if n
l. c. d.
then uh there is no meaning in having it on the t. v.
yeah
or then again you have a channels volume and all the stuff and what a
but you cannot display all on a l. c. d.
i mean that depends upon your design so
anyway for for the users who who who opt for l. c. d.
we'll give them the give them the l. c. d. we give what the customer uh wants right
i mean
yeah
so without l. c. d. you want to put it fi the same level of innovativeness
and which do you recommend e easy to use with l. c. d. or without l. c. d.
well i think both are really easy to use because there are few button buttons and uh well t p the menu are clear well organised so
yeah
yeah
yeah
well with little knowing of the technology you can you can easily use the product so i will give a six for the easy to use
yeah i think sorry
no it's just if i i see the
the f the rate i think it's better to do it without l. c. d.
because that's with l. c. d. just will increase the price and i thi i they have the same rate so without l. c. d. it will be
yeah
yeah
or we can just go back to the previous slide uh where we ha we have a few updates
so i mean in the product design you could just amend it to make some few changes according to fruit and vegetable or a spongy touch without l. c. d. and without speech recognition
yeah
yeah
yeah
even then our product is going to be very good
yeah it's cheaper to produce
yeah
mm
s
and uh if the the well if we have less technology we have more liberty to uh for the shape and uh things like that so
yeah that's right
yeah
i have another thing to say about the easy to use aspect
i think the easy to use uh aspect is different for different people
yep
for the young generation easy to use may be very complicated because uh they w they wants lot of controls with lots of buttons
mm-hmm
for kids they want simply the s similarit for the old people they want simplicity so that's why we have the parental module
yeah yeah that's right
uh we can ha have build a more complex design if if they want it
but but uh what i'm trying to say here is that the um we have different sets of buttons for different kinds of people
so in terms of easy to use i think it's very user customisable
user customisation is very important yeah
yeah
yeah so
so without l. c. d. i just take it five
six
mm-hmm
w uh
or you want it to be six
um six
i think it's the same
yeah
yes as you say with better uh yeah
without l. c. d.
s s oh i think it's better to have this without l. c. d.
and to improve the the look
as our programme manager s pro project manager says that without l. c. d. it is going to reduce the cost also and it's going to be much simpler to use
yeah
yeah
mm
yes and to give us more liberty to have a fancy look so
yeah
so let's go back to our laboratory and
to improve on the design
so
what a what what about the sys speech recognition
huh
what about the integration of speech recognition
the speech recogniser is a add on module
yeah
right
that's going to be an optional
if somebody wants to buy it they can have it otherwise no
yeah
ah so it's optional with the okay
it's an optional
it's optional yeah since well according to this study uh people more likes more to have a spongy uh remote control than
i think it will be i think i
yeah
i think it will be better if we have all these modules in the same remote control because maybe parents will lose these uh
yeah but i mean if you have an add ons the kids may just uh hide the parental module and so that their parents can't use it
yeah
or ma yeah
or maybe parents they can for forget where they put it or so mayb better if you have all this in the same
in the same set yeah and and individual buttons to make them work
oh
the problem is if i we are bla if a customer wants a certain component
yeah
and doesn't want the parental control because it's a couple who do not have children when you sell the product in the market you could meet any kind of people
and not all people will need all the functionalities we propose to them
so we might lose the customer because of this
i don't know what do you think uh
so you mean that even if these modules will be will be functional uh will be optional
yes exa what do you think i don't know
you are marketing manag
i mean how to how to how to make a marketing survey that uh how many married couple or how many couples have a t. v. or to the number or singles who have a television
uh
yeah
yeah
so based on that i think
yeah
but the the question is n does those modularity increase the production cost or decrease the production cost
well it's about the same because if
i think it inc increase
well you can if you had uh something li
i think it i increases
oh no because if you if you add uh something well yeah maybe because it's three different pieces uh to to to build but
hmm
but you can make it on a single p. c. with three different options
yeah yeah yeah it's i think it's cheaper if you if you already built the all the functionalities um on the same module but uh
mm
mm
yeah
on the same p. c. b. yeah yeah
yeah
well well the other aspect is that if in the when they have the ar existing product you you gonna maintain the the you're gonna keep the same customer
because the same customer will come back to buy other add ons
yeah that's right
so so
i mean you could just provide with an optional
yeah i i so if don't don't buy now they can buy i in the future
so in in that way you're actually keeping the cus the same customer attracting them to come back in again and again
so it's something like a microsoft product update
and and we we we we we we don't want that
we're not trying to follow the microsoft and we don't want to the m
updates and we sell it
we make updates and sell it
yeah well if the buyers can be up the th would be can be upgraded it would be a good thing right
yeah
yeah it depends on the v production
and uh what's the idea about uh the shape of the remote controls
uh can they be made into a fruit and vegetable types
well so
yeah yeah i think we are yeah but we are also the um well the components will have to change because uh we have to deal with the shape and um but i don't think it will uh increase the cost too much so
do you require different types of p. c. b. s and
mm
or uh it could be like this the p. c. b. would be the same for all but only the exterior uh shape is different o for all
mm
uh well but it's a bit complicated to if if if you need machines to different machines to um ah well
yeah
what we can change is to propose the customers with skins
for example the i the mobile phones nowaday they sell different kinds of skin and then people just feel that oh i have a new skin and looks better
yeah yeah that's right
yeah yeah we can have the same global shape and then uh add on skins and with with this uh tex spongy texture uh things like that
yeah
yeah
yeah that's right
yeah
yeah you can pl in what material would that be in uh
sponge
i think you need to look into the material
yeah or furry like a pet dog kind of thing
yeah yeah
okay
so
so we finished the prototype uh presentation if you have uh something else to say
i think the project manager would be interested to look about the financial issues in making these models
project evaluation project satisfaction for example
i don't know we have to ask these question
we have to give answers so
i suppose that you this criteria is it
project evaluation
room for creativity
this room is a bit small but but i think it's okay for us to work with
i feel it's fine we know we don't need uh i think it's okay
yeah mm
that was good
this is fine for making a presentat for project presentations
mm
yeah anyway we have the laboratory nearby to build our modules so it's okay
yeah
mm-hmm
and the leadership was excellent
yeah i think so
good job good job
fine yes uh
he gave you the liberty to talk as you wants
yeah that's right
yeah that's right
uh the teamwork was very very good
very democratic
i was really i am very satisfying to work with
with you
thank you
thank you
oh
alright
alright
and new ideas found
any new ideas to make these presentations more interactive and more interesting
mm
come up with new product
i mean uh what type of product would you think could we make this more interesting
less fancy
mm we i i know something we need more cakes more biscuits on the table while we have meetings
yeah and also more well uh more seriously i think it's it's a good idea to have uh clear clear points whenever we do a meeting uh prior to the meeting to have uh well a list with the points who will be discussed or things like that
mm
but
i think it's alright
we achieved uh project goal i think
yeah that is within the budget
de
it's w yes more or less
mm
and the evaluation was
without without l. c. d. without speech recognition it will be simple
yeah that's right
yeah but
alright
and the next is celebration
so
so
so uh coffee machine
alright then we finished
yeah free free coffee
okay
yeah thank you for your work and
yeah thank you thank you very much
thank you very much
good morning
sorry
yeah busy job
good morning
so
oh good morning everyone
good morning
good morning
i'd uh like to welcome you to our first meeting
i've prepared a little presentation
my name is and uh i hope you will introduce yourself uh in a few minutes as will i
um i'm the project manager of this project and uh well i will tell you on what actually is the project
this is uh the agenda for our first meeting
um this is the opening then we will get i will hope we will get acquainted to each other
we'll do a little tool training with these two things
we'll take a look at the project plan
uh there will be time for discussion
actually we have to discuss because we have to create a product
and then we will close this session
um but first of all we i'd like to uh introduce you to this room
um as you probably have noticed there are little black uh fields on the table
um you have to put your laptop exactly in that field so the little cameras can see your face
um there are cameras
everywhere around the room especially here for your face of course and this isn't a pie
it's a a set of microphones and there are microphones here also
but please uh don't be afraid of them
they won't hurt you
well
um well uh i said i'm the project manager and uh i'm hoping uh for a good project and uh i'd like to hear uh who you are and what your functions are uh on this project
let's start with the ladies
well uh i'm uh and my uh function is user interface design
i think
so uh that's me
okay uh i'm uh i'm the industrial designer and i uh hope to uh look forward to uh a very uh pleasing uh end of this uh project
okay so i
me too
my name's
i'm uh marketing expert
my job is in the company to promote company or promote products to the customers
so i also h hope we have a pleasant uh working with uh with each other
okay well we have some expertise from uh different pieces of the of the company
that's good
um well i said uh we're working on a project and the aim for the project is to to create a to design a new remote control which uh has to be original
trendy and of course user friendly
and uh i hope we have the expertise to create such a project such a product
um the way we hope to achieve that is uh the following methods
it consists of three phases namely the functional design conceptual design and detailed design
as you can see all of these phases consists of two parts namely individual work part and a meeting where we will discuss uh our work so far
okay
but first i will uh tell you something about the tools we have here
i already talked about the cameras and microphones but they are not of uh much use to us
uh
we will have to take advantage of these two things
they are smart boards
as you can see you can give a presentation on them
and uh this one here is a white board
i will uh instruct you about that soon
um as you also noticed uh this presentation document is in our uh project folder and every document you put in this folder uh is uh it is possible to show that here in our meeting room
um and yeah there are available on both smart boards but i think we will uh mainly use this one for the documents in the shared folder
as you can see this is the same tool bar uh as is located here
um the most functions uh we will use will be to to add a new page
um uh to go back and forward between pages and of course uh to save it every now and then
um and this is the pen with which you can draw on the board for instance
like this if everything's okay but i first have to put it on the pen you see i'm new to it too
um and then you can write things like test or whatever you want
oh
as you can see you have to move it a little bit slow it's not such a fast board it's a smart board but also a slow board
uh but you can write things and of course you can also when you click here uh erase things so we have uh est left
and um you can also delete an entire page but we ask you not to do that
just simply create a new one and uh start all over because we want to save all the results
um does everyone understand this
so we can't erase anything
mm-hmm
yeah
nice application
well you can erase it with the eraser but uh you shouldn't delete an entire page but just create a new blank one
right
s
i will delete this one now because we don't use it yet
alright
but you can of course erase when you make a mistake but don't uh delete entire pages
and you can also um let's see i think it's here uh change the uh colour of your pen
for instance take a blue one and uh change the line width like to five
um that's what you will need for our first exercise because i'm uh going to ask you to draw your favourite animal
it's also to gets to know each other because um i'm asking three things uh for that uh drawing to do it on a blank sheet
okay
with different colours and i just showed you how to pick a colour and also with different pen widths which i also showed you
um and a favourite characteristic can be just uh one word
well i'm not very good at drawing but i will uh go first
and um try to draw
or maybe you should guess what i'm drawing eh
good
hmm
no
it's a sheep
dinos dinosaur
seal a seal
beaver
a beaver
a be
well it uh
it's weird
could be everything
mm
with a tail and a mouth
maybe when i put on
it has wings
turtle
this thing
it could be a turtle or a snail and
snail
well the snail doesn't have legs
okay
but a turtle has
and those are slow
and i hope our project group will not be slow but we will uh work to a good result and do it uh as fast as we can
okay time for another animal
would you like to go next
no problem
sure
no problem
oh right
mm
it was four months
nice okay
well
the hell
to make it a little bit easier
it's a giraffe
make that cute
or a dinosaur
no it's a giraffe
'kay
i think it's
easy to r uh to
recognise as a giraffe
yes
mm-hmm
giraffe
yeah the favourite charis characteristic is that the long neck it can reach everything
and i hope i can also reach a lot with this project
so that's my favourite animal
okay
anything else you need to know
could you write the words uh underneath it
oh uh
or more words
tall
tall
so 'kay
should i uh
alright
so i can draw but uh
uh
well
oh
b
it's a mouse
bunny rabbit
a bunny rabbit
oh wrong one
uh
well uh you can guess what it is i hope
uh-huh
no problem
it's a rabbit
little rabbits
and uh well uh it's uh quick i guess
that's uh my uh favourite animal
okay thank you
okay
and our final drawing
bob ross
dolphin
a dolphin
okay um
uh i uh draw i i've drawn a dolphin because of its intelligence
one of the most intelligent uh
right
mm-hmm
animals in our world
well
yeah intelligent
with an e.
i've i've uh eraser
you can try out the eraser now
pen
well not perfect but okay
okay well thank you very much
i can see we have some uh drawing talent uh in this group huh
not really
well nice animals nice words
sounds good
um back to business back to the money part
um from the finance department i have learned that we are aiming for a selling price of twenty five euros
and we're hoping for a aim of fifty million euros and uh we are hoping to achieve that uh by aiming for an international market
and the production cost will be twelve euro fifty max
okay well it's time uh for some discussion
i've wrote down some examples here of what we can can speak about
uh what's your experience with remote controls um what kind of ideas do you have to design a new remote control
maybe for which market segments should we aim or should we aim for all segments
uh well actually i'd like to hand the word uh back to you
what's your experience with remote control
a lot of buttons
i always lose them
yeah
and you always lose them
yes
a lot of buttons which you don't use or who you don't use complex
yeah
mm-hmm
complex
yeah
not user friendly
search for the buttons which one is which and uh
no
no
boring
boring it's not fun to use a remote
no
mm
black all black
well
mm-hmm
so yeah
black colours
well maybe we should try to make it fun
mm-hmm
they use batteries and batteries uh and poor signal
mm-hmm
yeah
uh
the the angle you have to use
perhaps that you have a lot of road remotes r road con remote controls
you had different remote controls for different devices
yeah different remote controls yeah
yes perhaps you can integrate them or something
yes
uh for the use of different uh devices
yes
yeah
your stereo and your t. v. and uh
mm-hmm
perhaps that's an idea
yeah but then again you you still have a lot of buttons so
yeah that's right
yeah but you could uh i thin uh there's a possibility to g uh to uh
and which you don't use
to put those buttons uh behind some uh kind of uh protection so that if y y you only get to see them when you need 'em
flap yeah
right
yeah okay that's possible but it'll get very big the the remote control
that's possible so that you only get the no n n no
yeah
you should just give it to
just uh for example you got th uh the same size uh remote control you use everyday
but um the usual buttons such as uh um zapping uh as you call it in dutch
mm-hmm
changing channel
uh and the volume control uh are only the only possible buttons uh to use directly
mm-hmm
mm-hmm
or uh the numbers of course
numbers
but uh not uh the buttons used to search on the the channels on your television
on and off
you only use those uh the first time or
yeah play pause stop
so
uh
mm-hmm
so maybe a a minimalist design the least uh possible amount uh of buttons
yeah i think so yeah
yes
but you should make sure that you have every button they need on it
mm-hmm of course
because uh things for uh teletext i dunno uh w what's the name
yeah uh teletext
mm-hmm
think so
okay
so you don't want to bother people with uh loads of buttons
but on the other hand they need many buttons so they don't have to get out of their seat
no
yeah
yeah
but
right
because i think a market will be all kind of people
elderly p el elderly young people so
but if if it's if it's international you should uh look in think in britain they have uh different things they can do with the t. v.
or so uh that you can choose what you want to see
i dunno if you should uh take that in consideration or that you just should aim for the normal t. v. s that uh
uh
yeah i think that's the better one because
yeah i i understand
and the b. b. c.
i think if you you're going to target a lot of people and the whole world and only britain then i think the cost will uh rise higher than the twelve fifty
no
yes
i think
yeah i don't know if the they have that anywhere else though
i think the aim is better to use uh the whole world and britain yeah
yeah
yeah we can leave that
when i think of it uh i think the main idea uh of this remote remote control is uh
not that much
to make it user friendly
so uh i think uh when p uh when uh the customers will buy this remote control
they already have uh the remote control which uh companies uh uh with uh the the standards uh remote control with which comes uh with the television
mm
yeah
standard deliver
mm-hmm
mm
so uh it only has to have uh the most used buttons
you don't have to integrate the buttons to search the channels on your television
in those in that
no but
well but but then you have to to find your other remote control if you want to search
yeah
yeah th it it's i think that's not
that's not
yeah but i but it is impossible to uh to accommodate uh accommodate uh all the buttons on the s on the difference different televisions sets on one remote control
yeah that's right
it's impossible
yeah okay
because uh for example sony television uh has the opportunity to s to make uh uh to make it possible for to see on one side of the screen uh teletext
and on the other side uh just n uh regular television
no
yeah that's uh
uh
i think n m n most televisions nowadays do this
yeah but uh they don't use the same signal uh on remote control
well not everywhere
so i think numerals
because you can't use a panasonic uh remote control on a on a philips television
yeah but then you have to choose the this always with r universal remotes you have to choose the code
yeah you can choose the code
you can use which which type of television you have
okay
okay
that's no problem
okay
but i think like the two pages on the same screen like teletext and normal television that's that's nowadays standard i think
okay
but uh i think that most people uh th uh will buy the remote control because because uh the first they lost the one they lost first one or the first one is broken
simplicity
yeah
so uh uh perhaps they have a got a an older television so that option is not uh optional for those uh people
yeah yeah
mm-hmm
yeah
yeah g available
but the people have a new television and c if you look into the future then they want will want the button if their thing is broke
true
yeah yeah
yeah
so we should take that in consideration
yeah
mm-hmm
mm-hmm
mm-hmm
okay well any more ideas
oh mm no
of course
no
guess not
things'll come up
yeah
okay yeah well we have some time
let's see what more i have to tell you
i don't think there is much left
nope
we're starting to close
um our next meeting uh will start well we're a little bit early but our next meeting will start in in thirty minutes
in the meantime uh there's time for some uh individual actions
um as you can see the different roles have uh different tasks
and there's a ping
is it my laptop
yeah
yep
stop the meeting now
ah well that's good five minutes and uh the meeting's over uh right on schedule
yeah meeting will close in five minutes
okay
um the marketing expert will uh will take a look at the user requirement specification
the user interface designer will work out the technical functions design
and this was the interface designer
or the interaction designer
hmm-hmm
mm
or what was it i. d.
no interface
no
interface
interface designer okay first guess was right
uh will take a look at the the working design
no the industrial designer will take a look at the working design and the in uh usability interaction yeah okay
no the yeah
industrial designer okay sorry
let's just use the acronyms
okay
so
um and of course specific instructions uh will be sent to you uh through your personal coach
so i should look at uh what you should be able to do with the remote or uh or how i don't really
uh well those instructions will be uh in the email you will receive uh shortly i hope
right
alright
me too
and of course you have your own uh expertise
well uh that was what i had to say
uh-huh
uh are there any more questions
okay
no
no
no
okay well i think then we have to head uh back to our offices and uh start working
i have one question
okay
okay one question
oh
where does it says we have to make a remote because i presumed
she didn't know who
okay no no problem
no problem
okay we're still going
no problem
okay well i expect everything will be much clearer with the instructions we will receive uh shortly
okay
yeah
mm-hmm
alright
okay well uh see you all in about thirty minutes then
alrighty
yeah
okay
thank you very much
yeah
okay
good morning again
one question
yeah
send
choose a number
submit
yep yep yep yep
all set
mm
mm-hmm
yeah
good
okay
let's see what we can find here
okay
a very warm welcome again to everyone
um here we are already at our uh functional design meeting
um and this is what we are going to do
the opening which we are doing now um and the special note i'm project manager but on the meetings i'm also the secretary
which means i will make uh minutes as i did of the previous meeting
and uh i also put these as fast as possible in the uh project folder so you can see them and review what we have discussed
um if i'm right there are three presentations i guess each one of you has prepared one
yes
good
and um we will also take a look at new project requirements um if you haven't heard about them yet
and then of course we have to take a decision on the remote control functions and we have some more time forty minutes
but i think we will need it
um well i don't know who wants to go first with his presentation
i'll go first
okay
yeah
i'll go first yeah
well
you can go first okay
well shall i go first with the users
well everybody already has his presentation so you can adjust it
i think well okay no problem
is there an order
i haven't
ja precies ja precies ja precies
so
huh
okay um
and one question uh your name denni is it with a
e. i. e.
i. e. e. i. e. okay
thank you
okay um i wanted to explain the working design of the remote control
it's possibly very handy if you want to uh design one of those
um
well so it basically works uh as i uh uh r wrote down uh in this uh little uh summary
uh when you press a button uh that's when you do pr for example when you uh want to turn up the volume
um a little connection is made uh the the rubber uh button just presses on a
sorry
on a little print plate uh which uh makes uh uh a connection that uh
gives the chips uh which is uh mounted beneath those uh that plastic of a rubber button
uh senses that a connection has been made and know and knows what button you pressed becau uh for example the the volume up or volume down button
um uh the the chip uh makes a morse code uh like uh signal which uh then is si uh signalled to uh several transistors which makes uh which sends the signal to a little let
you know what a let is
yeah
okay
and that makes uh the the infra red lights signal which is sent to the television set
uh which has a sensor in it to uh sense uh the signal of the infra red
that's basically uh how it works
um the findings uh uh that i found uh searching up some uh detailed information about the remote controls are that uh they are very easy to produce
uh it is pis uh it's possible to uh make them in mass production because it is as eas it is as easy as uh printing a page
uh just uh fibreglass plate um is b uh is uh covered with uh some uh coatings and uh uh
and chips
uh and the technology's already available
we don't have to find out how remote controls uh have to work or uh how that how uh to make some chips that are possible to uh to to transmit those uh signals
uh i made a little uh
uh
animation of about how a tran our uh remote controller works
oh right
animation
we tel
there is something turning
there
yeah it's a little bug it's in the in the smart board
okay
uh well the sub component i suppose that you understand what a sub component is is f in this example it's the button
uh when it is pressed down um the switch is ter is uh is switched on
so with uh the wire is sent to the to the chip in uh co operation with the battery of course
because to make uh a a signal possible you have to have some sort of uh
li uh a d ad uh electronic uh
infrared light
yes uh okay
um w after it's being composed by the chip uh the signal uh is transported uh to the infra red bulb
and from there it signals a morse code like signal to the to the b to the bulb in uh in the television set
okay
s uh i wrote down some personal preferences about uh the remote control
of course it is very handy if the remote control is hand held so you don't have to uh uh wind it up or something
or just is it's it's very light to uh to make uh to use it
uh i personally uh pref prefer that uh it would be p uh come available in the various colours and uh easy to use buttons
but i suppose that the one of the other team members uh uh thought of that uh too
yeah i've got it there too
and it is possible for several designs and um easy to use b uh sorry easy to use buttons
perhaps soft touch uh touch screen uh buttons because uh the rubber buttons are always uh uh they uh slightly uh they can be slightly damaged
uh so the numbers on the buttons are not possible uh to read anymore
and uh well as i said uh before th uh we can uh make several designs
yeah
okay well that's my contribution to this meeting and uh
to this meeting
okay thank you
two of these this meeting
shall i go uh next
yep
so
'kay
please
so
smoking
well uh my name's and i looked at uh technical functions design of the remote
uh i did this by uh looking at examples of other remote controls of how they uh they look and information from the web that i found
um well what i found was that uh th the actual use of the remote control is to send messages to television set
how you uh d what you described uh just early
and this can be all sorts of medsa messages turn it on turn it off uh change the channel adjust volume that kind of thing
uh play video teletext but also t uh play c. d. if you use it your c. d. player the remote control will that one
there are some uh examples of remote controls
you can see they are very different
the one has got all the functions that you could possibly need and an lot of uh buttons etcetera
and the other is uh more user friendly little with big buttons
and uh not n all the the the the stuff you can do with it but uh the the essential stuff is there
um i guess you could better y you should look at a a user centred uh approach
because the customers have to use them and and if they don't think it's usable they won't uh buy it
a lot of buttons they may think from i don't need s as much as that
uh well perf personal preferences is is uh a simple remote with uh the basic functions that you can need that you could use
but uh keep in mind the new functions of t. v. what we discussed earlier split screen and uh is that a function that you should have
because all the t. v. s will have them
or because of only a few and isn't really necessary
and then uh make it i would make so that you can could uh use it on more than one appliance
if you have one that uh uh does with the vi the the video
it could also work with uh with the stereo because play is play and stop stop and that sort of thing
the shu c you could reuse the buttons so that you don't have to have a lot of buttons for uh anything
and it should be a user friendly clear buttons and not too much
and that is my presentation
okay thank you
okay
'kay
check
you must still have it open
kijke
'kay so
we're going to j discuss the functional requirements of the remote that m that means that functions user n want to have on the remote control or just
yeah and the users actually
the methods i i prefer is we're going to look which section of the users we are going to focus a l on more
are the younger people going to buy the remote control or the elderly people
and then tho that section we're going to focus and adjust the remote more to that section than the whole user
section
okay
some data
younger people from sixteen to thir forty five um years are more interested in fj features like l. c. d. screens speech recognition e etcetera
and we possess about two third of the market from in that range of age
the elderly people from forty five years to sixty five years are not that much interested in features
and we possess less than two third that's two fifth of the market share in that area
goed so
hmm
'kay
findings
fifty percent of the users lose their remote often
so we don't have to make it very small like uh like a mobile phone or something
yeah
but some somewhat bi bigger than small so you don't lose it that much anymore
seventy five percent of the users also find it ugly and fif seventy five of the users zap a lot
mm
so the buttons sh should be that small or shouldn't be that complex because we have to search for the buttons which one are you going to use
next
important issues about the remote
i think it would be better with a personal reference but okay
remote control has to have to have a low power usage because s w
seventy five percent of the users only zap one time an hour so the power usage is also one one time an hour
or so with a high power usage we would
use a lot of but batteries
the volume button and the channel buttons are the two most important buttons on the remote control so those they those have to h be find very easily
and have to be somewhat like bigger
etcetera
it has also be have to find easily when the label is gone
my colleague also announced it that labels should be scratched off or would be s uh
mm
hmm
senden okay
so uh if that's k uh if that's the problem you also have to find it easily
on the remote
buttons
like what all colleagues said have to have to be minimalized
or should be covered or in l. c. d. screen
l. c. d. screen is easy because we have the l. c. d. screen we have the various options
put one option and then you have the all the buttons of that options so the other options would be gone
and you don't see the buttons
so l. c. d. screens should be easy
but an l. c. d. screen
the problem with the l. sc l. c. d. screen is that elderly people fr from forty five to for sixty five years don't use the l. c. d. screen a lot
so we have to that keep that in mind that if you're going to implement l. c. d. screen
you don't have to make it that hard to learn or to use
uh l. c. d. screen as in uh touch screen
yeah touch screen yeah
okay
the last but not least younger people are more critical about the features
because they use the remote control often more often and are more technical than the ol older people
and the older people spend more money and easily on a remote control
mm
'kay
so we have to keep in mind to to focus not a lot not that much on the younger pep younger people but also somewhat on the elderly people
and on my personal preferences i don't have any mo more time to come with that but like i said
l. c. d. screen is easily to use because you have you can implement a lot of buttons in one remote with not that much buttons
and it should be easy to use
especially the volume buttons the channel buttes buttons and the number buttons to zap through the channels
and that is it
okay
okay thank you
oh right
um well thank you all huh
i dunno uh did everyone receive an email with uh the new project requirements
no
no
well
res i did not
no
perhaps the rest
then i think it's a good thing that i made a separate slide of them so you can
ja
all read them
oh well not in this presentation
hmm
should be in there
well i can tell you them uh from my laptop
um teletext does has become outdated since the popularity of the internet
oh
so that's uh the first thing we i think we should pay less attention to uh teletext
uh the remote control should only be used for the television otherwise the project becomes more complex
which endangers the time to market and of course would make it more costly i think
um our current customers are within the age group of forty plus
and new product should reach a new market with customers that are younger than forty and you talked about that before
and uh a last point but also very important our corporate image should stay recognisable in our products
which means that our uh corporate colour and slogan must be implemented in the new design
so we have to keep that in mind
um well uh according to our agenda it's then time to take a decision on the remote control functions
mm
so who has any idea about what should be on it and what shouldn't
well you said it should only uh work with one appliance
be television
or with one uh d che only the t. v.
yeah
yeah
only be used for television
and the video also or not uh
only the television
well it says only for television here huh
oh
alright
makes it a lot easier huh
okay
yeah
mm
so yeah then you can yeah
requirements no
functions
mm-hmm
then it should have uh on off and uh
yeah for
yeah the basics then by a volume channel one till two zero numbers on it oh teletext doesn't have to be
standby options yeah
uh yeah
yeah
and per perhaps uh
no
um other functions
well uh uh yes yes s sh a button where you can uh change from one number to two numbers
yeah i had
two s two two digits oh okay
yeah yeah
can you don't know if that's got a name but
yeah i understand what you mean
i think it's i think it's easy to implement a button with a s s what which especially do that because some t. v. s
yeah
if you press the t one and then the two it be between five secs it make twelve and that's that's not relaxed
it makes it twelve yeah
yeah
indeed
s
okay
well not really and and there are some models that don't uh accommodate that function
to user
yeah
so d uh wh the philip's television makes it possible in that indeed to uh press one and then two to make uh the uh tj to reach channel twelve
so that it easy and fast
yeah
but uh all the television makes uh use of those button where you first press that button and then press two digits to uh to get
yeah
yeah
yeah so you should have that one on
uh yeah think so
our main targets' age are
were
forty five plus or
mute misschien also
mm
uh well new product should reach a market with customers that are younger than forty and now we have current customers uh of forty plus
forties okay because because younger people as
uh younger people have now sixteen till to twenty five age are f eighty one percent interested in l. c. d. screen
from twenty six to thirty five have sixty six percent and thirty six to forty five fifty five percent so i think to um
because on most recog remote controls um the print plate will be broken how much two years
you have to press h very hard to go to the next channel
mm-hmm
mm-hmm
with the l. c. d. screen it's easier because you only have to wipe the screen to uh for fingerprint and then you can use it again
yeah we we could yeah
but i think that uh that collides with our mission to make it very cheap
because l. c. d. screens are very expensive
yeah okay
yeah but a you don't know
a touch screen uh probably uh even more
an
so true true
true
but uh
well um is it possible to make an l. c. d. screen uh how was the information
yeah it only says that this perce percentage like l. c. d. screen
because yeah and it says that younger age between sixteen and forty five highly interesting features more critical
and if the only f
so perhaps we should we should focus on that l. c. d. screen
yeah because our target is sixteen to forty five
but do you
yeah but uh will we not uh
exceed our uh our uh production uh
yeah you don't know how much it costs
yeah you don't know how much it costs the l. c. d. screen
is it possible to find out anyway
no i don't have any costs here i only have percentages
you know
but if you would do an l. c. d. screen do we have don don't you have any buttons
or because if it only directs at the t. v. then you only have uh i don't know what you want to do with the l. c. d. screen
yeah
no an l. c. d. screen's just like uh like a drawn here
um just uh displays several buttons for example um if you wanted the minimal uh use b uh buttons
yeah
such as channel and volume
you just h uh displays four buttons on the screen and it's possible to p uh press them down just like a touch screen
oh right so you can
oh yeah alright
so you can adjust which buttons you want on that s screen
yeah if you want to adjust like for example adjust the audio settings
yeah we can make it possible to do that yeah
you press audio on the touchscreen and you get the buttons for audio settings so the other buttons are gone
yeah yeah
yeah alright oh right
yeah
yeah yeah
so we're going for an l. c. d. screen
yeah
i think it's the most easier thing yeah
would be yeah
that's my uh
and hoping that when we produce a lot it won't be too expensive
no
yeah
well we had twelve fifty i guess for uh production
yeah
twelve fifty
yeah
i dunno how expensive an l. c. d. screen is
um
any guesses
well i suppose wi if the mar if our um
if the i if the young people are interested in l. c. d. screens we should make 'em
highly
mm-hmm
and if that is our d uh market share to uh and our goal to uh deliver those uh remote controls
yeah
but
but he also said that we should not only focus on the younger people
but also on the older and will they use it if it only has an l. c. d. screen
yeah but
um s forty six to forty five thirty three percent and sixty fifty six to sixty five twelve percent
but our our our what's it project requirements are the new products should be reached for new markets to customers that are younger than forty
oh so still a little bit people
yeah
yeah that's right
but you don't want to alienate the other uh
no that not now but so
but if they also buy it then it's alright
i guess
yeah but market share fro for for forty years and younger is higher than that of sixty five and younger
yeah
yeah
alright
okay so l. c. d. it is
an yes
mm
okay
it's treasure
and what else
i hope we uh h and let's hope to reach those uh those sales
yeah i i if it yeah if it costs gets too much too expensive then yeah we should be sticking to rubber buttons
yeah
yeah can you um uh s i think that that they will send you some information about uh the cost of l. c. d. uh screens
n nothing no costs at all
yeah
uh so if you uh yeah so if you uh you receive an email about that
but perhaps later so uh
uh can you post it in the or shouldn't we post that in uh our projects mail uh folder
yeah in
i think that should yeah i think we all get the costs of everything
yeah
i don't
because you are the the marketing uh expert
yeah okay i'll i'll post it
i uh
well perhaps we should have a backup plan that we would use buttons if it's uh too expensive
yeah sure sure
yeah
yeah okay
but for now it's l. c. d.
okay l. c. d. yeah
yeah
okay
then you have the seventy five percent of users find it r ugly
the l. c. d.
yeah and eighty percent of the users would spend more money with a when a remote would look fancy
oh that's a bit of a problem
oh that's a bit of a problem
mm
tha i l i it'll look fancy with l. c. d. screen
it's looks fancy one yeah of l. c. d. screen
yeah but they don't they don't like it
yeah
yeah
they think it's ugly
when it has an l. c. d. screen
yeah just a the plain remotes not not specific l. c. d. remotes
oh alright i thought that you said that
so
yeah and maybe you can make something fancy out of an l. c. d. remote because it's new as far as i know
yeah
mm-hmm
yeah of course
mm yeah
and then you have the other thing that seventy five percent zap a lot but that's not a f question with the l. c. d. screen
and then not yeah
um
only thing you have to do is wipe the screen off once each time to get all the fingerprints off it
yeah
yeah
mm
okay
okay what else does our remote need
um
a mute button
mute button
mm-hmm
i think
the most important things on a f on an on an uh remote control are channel selection volume con selection
and
yeah
and power s power usage
yeah
and a teletext but that is not of the question
but
other things are
but shouldn't you put a button of for teletext on the for the people who want to use it
sorry
yeah it could be
remembering we have got a big remote that you have to fill
yeah
mm-hmm
yeah and we could make an a a separate menu on the l. c. d. uh screen for teletext
yeah teletext
yeah
yeah
and there's also a
and other other less important things are screen settings audio settings and channel settings but
yeah they are less important but i think they should be there or not
less important
yeah should be there but not press yeah sub menu yeah
a sh but in a sub sub menu or something like that
uh i think it's also important to uh make it possible to um how do you call it in english uh
to not use batteries and use ac uh bat uh batteries to uh to be yeah yeah sure
mm-hmm
like with a with a mouse you have not yeah
indeed
so uh you can mount uh the the the uh
yeah in a breath it's
uh the remote control to um
mm-hmm
charted
we should think of the twelve fifty we have but
to refill the
yeah but we don't we don't have any costs now so yeah
i don't know how much that's going to uh
yeah
okay because i uh when you get an l. c. d. screen you run it on batteries the batteries will be uh empty very soon very fast
yeah
yeah e e power supply is one of the most important things
you should perhaps you should be able to to switch the control off
yeah
if you have an l. c. d. screen that's burns all the time i dunno
yeah yeah
yeah
you shouldn't on and off because that's ver extra
that you have t first you have to turn the remote on and then you can uh i don't know
mm-hmm
uh
yeah
i think it's it's not that easy because i don't think people will like it who who uh that you have to turn it on first and then use it
nee that's that's uh yeah
so i think it's better when th the t. v. shuts down the remote shuts down
but then you can't
and go to standby mode when you don't use it so that
yeah
yeah
yeah yeah au automac matically that it yeah
yeah automatically
yeah
after two minutes or three minutes something like that
after two minutes yeah two three minutes yeah
yeah
yeah
and maybe a low battery indicator
yeah
on the screen
sure
yeah
and then b that uh before an hour when its get again gets empty
yeah
then you have plenty of time to recharge it of put it in a recharger
mm
charger
so we are going for the for the recharger
yeah
yeah if it's
okay
uh
if it's sensible
yeah because when you're watching t. v. you're zapping and you have to put it in a recharger and i don't think it
yeah
yeah b when the batteries are low
no when you when you're done with s uh w uh watching your television you have to put it
yeah okay but then we have to be sure that the the the the batteries go hours six hours five six hours then
yeah sure of course
but you'll also forget to put it in because you throw it on the couch and you don't remember
yeah then you have a problem
yeah but
but you also forget to buy batteries and then you can you can't use it so i
yeah
that's right
yeah
or we have to be sure that the batteries last couple of days when they're recharged
yeah
so
well i think the batteries should should w should work a lot longer than a couple of days or not
yeah because you have b but you have l. c. d. screen
'cause
yeah that's right but
high power usage
high power user cell i
uh it should be uh a standard move to to put your remote control in the charger when you're done watching television
yes
that's also a a a great advantage because you can't lose it anymore
because you are obliged to uh put it in the charger and not to uh leave it in a couch uh between some cushions
true
yeah
yeah
true
yeah
right
okay
yeah you made a point there
but then you also have to s have somewhere where you can put a remo recharger near your couch because otherwise you have to walk a long way when you twoft want to turn on the t. v.
yeah also
yeah otherwise all your yeah
just a small device
yeah
yeah it hasn't it doesn't have to be big
plug it in that's it
i think everything has it for and i guess
yeah like a like telephone charger or something
yeah just just a cable or a even a a a a a charger where you can mount it on
yeah
yeah
something like that just u
yeah
okay
alright
okay well i've
it has to be easy to use also or things
yeah you have some more
points
uh market share speaker re speech recognition
i think
functional designs uh for the elderly uh you could make it possible to enlarge the screen
so make it possible to not uh display uh a button at ten points uh or
also
well i think that this should be standard
large button large buttons
yeah but it is uh one of the functions you have to uh specify
yeah
okay
because we can look at uh uh perhaps uh forty buttons at a screen but the elderly only look at two buttons
okay
and you said something about speech recognition
yeah it says also yeah
speech recognition
hello
twelve euro twelve euro fifty
yeah twelve fifty twelve fifty
twelve
that's an also ninety one percent sixteen to twenty five
twenty six to thirty five years seventy six percent and thirty six to forty five thirty five percent
so it's pretty big
well spread it by a big market
but then i i i
even bigger than for l. c. d.
yeah
yeah
w i know let's do a speech
well let's leave out all the remote controls and just put a microphone on top of the television to
yeah
yeah
yeah
ninety
twenty five
you can clap or something
yeah yeah
channel
turn volume up
yeah
hey that that's an idea
now you shouldn't say the wrong thing i dunno
yeah
okay well that should it has to be remote control not
yeah twelve
yeah
but they want to talk into the remo remote control or something or
yeah
sure why not why not
is this only would you would you pay more for speech recognition in a remote control
it's the only thing it says
yeah mm
oh but do we want to implement that or
i think an l. c. d. screen should be suf sufficient
yeah
but when you look at the percentages
yeah it says a lot but
perhaps the options should be uh
speech recognition scores even higher huh
why not
yeah well maybe because of the cost but uh nobody knows uh how much uh it will cost uh
why not
yeah
let's hope uh to have some uh d
i know
no i think i think it's better to have l. l. c. d. screen because in the area of tw thirty six to forty five
we have about thirty percent of the market share in in our hands and fifty five of those people want l. c. d. screen and thirty five want speech recognition
so i think it's better to keep it with l. c. d. screen
mm
but would it be useful to imple implement both
yeah if the costs al allow it
on one remote
well
or
yeah i dunno
i don't know if that can be done with the cost of twelve fifty
nee
with that uh
if it should be done if it could be done i won't matter
yeah but how would you like to implement that that you say volume up and then it goes up or
we should do it
yeah
yeah
sure
yeah
yeah
uh
certain systems already exist i think
mm-hmm
then you also have to have different languages if we go international
then uh it's y it's yours to do a french and dutch and english and
true
true yeah
yeah
true
yeah
but that should also be with f should be also with l. c. d. screen
this should be uh accommodated with some software uh uh
yeah
because then i think in chinese is different written volume is different written than um swahili or something
yeah that's right
yeah
right
swahili
yeah you can use icons for the
swahili
yeah
ja well possible
a speaker and uh
indeed
but if that's better than language for the for the remote
yeah yeah yeah yeah
yeah
so we want to uh yeah it's international uh okay
then it's yeah
okay
'kay what else
so no speech recognition
or
well if it could be done we
yeah we have to keep yeah
y it should be done
if it could be done should be done
yeah
yeah and then we have different languages
yeah that should be uh anything matters
that's not so difficult at all because i already use on several voice operated systems and they are all possible to uh not all but
okay just make a separate remote for each uh
well you sh you should to adjust the thing
i think it's difficult
every language of dialects
yeah
i think it's very differen difficult
and you have to speak the so that it can understand
yeah
i think it can't be implemented but maybe
you could use that n as an option if you have money left or something
yeah 's an option yes
yeah sure indeed
fifty euro cents
yeah
let's do speech
yeah
for speech recognition
okay so we only do this when we have enough money left
yeah
okay
well i've written down an an on or off button volume selection channel selection uh the digits from one to zero huh
um or from zero to nine
uh a digits button to switch uh between one and two digits mute button a separate menu for teletext a battery indicator
um we're going to use a docking station and uh probably l. c. d. and if there's enough money speech recognition
mm
and uh the possibility to uh enlarge buttons or to have large buttons
mm yes
yeah
i with uh teletext if it wasn't ver very important it was but you also now have colours
in general
no but
i don't know if we should implement that
curved
yeah when you press the red button you go to page one hundred two and when you press the
uh yeah
i don't know if we should implement that because it says that teletext not really important but yeah the shortcut and you can't go to sport
um
s shortcuts
uh
i think we should we could that we could also implement a audio settings screen settings and channel settings but as sub menus
yeah
mm
d mainly if you turn the uh remote control on you have to u you have to see from one till zero channel and volume
and if you want to use teletext screen or audio then you can press it
sh yeah just just sub menu
it should be available but not
yeah
'cause it should be there
not directly uh available
not yeah
yeah
okay
okay so not too much teletext support but in a separate menu and
yeah
mm
so actually it is there but it's just not r ready there
yeah but s
directly available
yeah
so does it confuse uh the user
you'll have to search for it
they'd have to be easy to use
uh
i'll search um
if you want to use teletext you can push the teletext button and then the options uh become available
yeah
yeah that's a
the sign of it
okay but no more buttons or functions or
uh no
no
i guess not
what else can you do with a television
we've got anon
aren't we forgetting something very important
have got got two examples here but i don't think there's anything we're missing
uh play pause doesn't n need to be there
well we don't have the video orders
yes so this is your presentation
we could check the other remote controls with technical functions
yeah you could look here all the the
which ones were yours
uh th th th th i don't know technical functions
techni
they're a bit small you can we should stretch them because
ping
ja ja ja ja ja
technical functions
yeah okay
i guess we've got them all
uh i think i go to have volume mute but i yeah
very slow
yeah the zoom buttons
and for a t. v.
yeah b wide screen high screen different things you have yeah different uh yeah
can you zoom in a t. v.
or that you can put 'em on uh on on wide and yeah
but that should also be a sub then a sub uh menu thing
menu
yeah it should be available but then in separate screen settings or something
yeah so we should also implement se screen settings
mm
yeah screen settings audio settings teletext settings you have
oh right
yeah
channel settings
yeah so you can program the
so those four and of course the main
yeah so the first you see the main and the other ones you can uh go to uh
yeah
yeah
like tap screens or something or i dunno
yeah
i hope we can do this
something
there are a lot of options depending uh on what kind of television you got
yeah if uh
'cause if you don't got a wide screen television you don't need the uh the screen settings uh for uh
no you don't yu a no you then you don't no ni don't then you don't use it
yeah and if the television does not support such uh operations
mm-hmm
we don't have to use that top
yeah
yeah
yeah
so you leave it alone
yeah
yeah
or it could be possible to have a a standard version of the remote an expanded version
yeah
and do we want them in different colours or
yeah
and and the buttons should they have colours
colours
yeah
colours i think the main colour of the remote control is uh the colour of the l. c. d. screen
oh but we don't have any buttons
yeah
i because we don't want a lot a devi yeah a device self s g
yeah
yeah then defines itself
because uh how many percent
eighty percent
they think it's ugly right
would spend more money if it looks fancy
okay so use uh very uh lot of peo
perhaps you can uh make adjustable fronts like with the telephones
adjust with phones yes
you can uh but i don't think that uh
okay
twelve euro fifty
well make it available in different colours you mean
sure
yeah
yeah
red white blue black
rasta colours
and a see through uh
grey
yeah sea view yes simpson's versions and
yeah
yeah see through version
yeah
if you press a button it turns green
yeah
okay well that's the
leave
a disco version
five minutes
signal for las final five minutes
um so i have uh the things i just read
um then we have uh separate menus for teletext screen settings audio settings and what else
yeah
channel settings
oh yeah right
channel settings
so you can program the t. v.
yeah
okay
mm
perhaps you should you'd throw them on on in one pile
so options and then you sub them
yeah
otherwise you have all those teletext perhaps teletext not but
could be possible
mm
or like uh you have a menu button you press yeah or otherwise you have a menu button
no we said teletext also a separate menu
yeah but i
press menu then you have uh main uh menu search uh all the all the settings
yeah
yeah
okay but we can work that out later i guess
but
yeah no problem
so we're having a a general menu with the most used functions uh teletext screen settings
yep
audio settings channel settings and maybe there are options for the remote itself
like uh large icons or small icons and
i don't know
um i think b because we don't have a lot of buttons on the one screen
i don't know what else but
no
i think the buttons yeah but but or like you have you only have channel button or volume button
or do we have any buttons
on the remote
which one
those buttons you can you can
but that's also in the l. c. d. right
yeah but on the l. c. d. huh
yeah
right yeah okay
yeah th
so we don't have any normal buttons that uh no alright
no no normal buttons yeah
maybe only the on and o on and off button
yet on and off is p is perhaps you kno
but we don't need a special we don't need a special options menu for the remote itself
but i don't think
uh not button
mm no
no no
okay
oh well you should be able to set which t. v. you have
if you have if you have uh
yeah sure of course you need uh a settings button uh or a settings option for the remote control
yeah
but isn't idea to use uh uh what you said uh normal on and off button for the t. v. that you don't have to use a
no no no because we we discussed that you could charge it otherwise is it it jumps to stand by mode automatically
yeah but but not for the remote but for the t. v. that you use
yeah but a t. v. of course
th that's the i think that's a best thing is that to implement that one in the menu with the volume and channel
but a not as normal button in the l. c. d. yeah
no
well maybe there should be a separate button apart from the l. c. d. because you can't turn it on when the l. c. d. is off
so how do you turn the thing on
there has to be a on button on the remote huh
no you just tap i think
yeah you tap
just tap it
touch screen yeah then it's turn turn off turn on
tap the thing
okay
and then the television is on also or just the remote
no just the remote
a television don't have to be on that one you can press on yeah stand by
sure
but
yeah it should be in standby mode but
then press on remote press on and then t. v. should be available
yeah a yeah
or not
i don't know whether it's handy to have a n a normal on button
a r just uh rubber uh for for t. v. so you can turn it on and then you can choose the channel
separate
otherwise you i don't know whether or not that's
a a a normal button on the remote control or norm
yeah yeah
to turn it on
of or you should put it in the l. c. d. screen
yeah because uh when you touch the l. c. d. screen when it is in standby mode it should pop on
yeah i have yeah
okay well
wh uh why would it be a a need to have a normal button
well i i guess if you use the l. c. d. screen you first have to search where is the on button
then you uh you you then turn it and then the t. v. goes on
but if you have a normal on button on the on the remote then you do the on and then you search the channel which you want
yeah but i think the re the remote control if you press tap the screen
it always should jump to the screen which has the volume button channel button and of course of also the on and off button
mm
oh right
i think it looks a lot more fancy if you use uh if you don't have any buttons on the s on on remote control
yeah i think so too
otherwise y wet e k yeah
yeah
yeah
so actually we're going to create a a button less uh remote
yeah
no buttons at all
okay well that's might be a unique selling point huh for a remote
mm-hmm
if we can afford it
okay well i guess we have to
yeah if we can afford it
oh okay
yeah
postpone further discussion to uh our next meeting because we're running out of time
um for now we're having a lunch break
oh
and then there will be uh half an hour for the uh next share of individual work
i will uh write uh minutes if i can create them out of this
and uh put them in the the project documents uh folder
mm
and here are the individual actions for the for the other roles
and of course specific instructions will be sent to you again by your uh personal coach
alright
luckily as we are
okay well thank you very much for now and uh have a nice lunch huh
mm-hmm
lunch
okay
food
should we put this back in our rooms or uh
yeah think so
yeah
okay welcome everyone to our next meeting
i'm busy writing and busy leading the meeting
but um i've prepared a little presentation once again um or at least an agenda i think uh the biggest part of the presentation will be uh on your side
um we are here at the conceptual design meeting which is hereby opened
um once again i will try to uh write some minutes which i just from the previous meeting uh placed inside our project folder
which was quite some typing
um today we once again have uh three presentations if i'm right and after that we will take a decision on the remote control concepts
and just as the last time we have forty minutes to accomplish that
okay well
i'd say let's start with the first presentation
'kay
um in the same order as last time
w sure
mm
okay
alright
well take it away
okay uh welcome you all
components design
um uh first of all uh i would like to uh uh accommodate some of those uh things i uh uh elaborate some of the things i did
i i elaborated on the concept
what should be um
uh said about uh the components uh its properties and what kind of materials should we use to uh to make uh one of those r remote controls
uh well first of all i've uh d subtracted some of the components that is that are used uh are w w um you know from what uh the remote control's formed
uh first of all the case the case the surrounding of the of the the remote control
i would like to uh give you an idea of uh how i thought about
don't destroy my giraffe
giraffe's gone now
okay um the case was is made from rubber i suppose
there's one of the because when you use a remote control a lot of people uh will uh will uh drop their remote control and they break uh becau the uh titanium was also an option
drop it
hmm
but uh it's a very expensive material
uh rubber is i think uh the best suitable uh material uh to use uh for our uh
for our remote control
um it's poss it's also possible to uh create fancy colours with rubber
uh rubber l makes it easy to uh to to it lets lets itself colour
uh titanium uh you have to paint it and with that uh it's possible to scratch it or uh yeah make it ugly
uh rubber uh the total uh piece of rubber that's sor uh that's that's used uh to make the case is uh the same colour
so if you scratch it it's still the same colour perhaps uh it's a little bit damaged
but it's a very strong material
um i h i had an idea single covered uh curved sorry single curved
uh so it's t two dimensional
i think it's uh it's best to draw oh green
it's a colour
bright colour
uh
fancy colour
new
forward
blank
okay
you have to go t
let's make it uh black
okay
i thought of an idea like this
oh that
um delete
blank
okay
so it also looks nice when it's on your table
so you get uh it doesn't lay flat down on the table but it's c it's stands
oh it's a side view
side view yes it's side view so uh i i'm not technically good at th three d. modelling but
um uh it's just an idea i had so it's uh it's very uh so its also looks nice when it's on the table
um the graphical user interface and the buttons uh we also thought about that already
uh i thought about uh the l. c. d. touch screen which is uh is easy to clean too
one of the great uh advantages of the l. c. d. screen you just use some or uh another uh cleaning uh uh cl some cleaning stuff
and um it should be made of strong plastic and it should be bright
well i already uh s uh explained some properties of that material and i think uh well we also we almost concluded about that uh this should uh be uh our uh button component
true
so uh
uh that's all about uh the buttons
uh the batteries uh we also thought about that already
uh will be chargeable with uh uh an option for a mount station so you can uh put the uh the remote control in a mount station so its charges itself up instead of uh plugging it in or something like that
questions
no no no no no
no
okay
just looking
and they should be long lasting not uh not be empty uh in about uh two minutes or uh thirty minutes or forty minutes of use
and next step is the chip uh th the component that's uh makes or transmits the signal to the television
uh there was an option to use s a rather simple chip but i think uh because uh of our uh highly uh requiring uh requirements
there should be an advanced chip in it with uh also the ability to uh facilitate speaker speech recognition uh which unfortunately is still in a test phase
so uh there should be some more uh investigation on that side
uh my personal preferences uh i also overheard in the last meeting that there shou we should use uh our own business colours
that was correct wasn't it
mm-hmm
okay
i think they are rather boring for um for use with rubber
well business colours i thought it was the the slogan and uh the corporate image so yeah it needs colour
okay they should be m sh they should be in mind wasn't it
but i don't think you have to make the entire thing in the corporate colour
okay so it d it doesn't says uh to uh have the slogan
it must be recognisable
okay okay
well that's possible of course
we could make a little r. and r. on the top of the machine
you can put the r. and r.
uh so they are pretty boring i suggest because just the availability with rubber to make fantastic colours uh and also in a lot of possible colours
so it's possible to make very uh fancy uh remote controls which peopl uh who people
in which people will find they're uh interesting
and uh will buy uh them faster when they look at the same old grey or black uh colours
uh s as i said uh before rubber is uh is impossible to damage severely imp instead of uh of course you can break it when you you when you break it in s for example with a pair of scissors or something like that
but i if you drop it it's not uh broken uh right away s instead of using uh plastic hard plastic or uh titanium
and i personally liked uh the single curved uh remote control because it yeah it makes sense
okay
well that's all about my uh my findings
alright
okay thank you
mm mm mm
i will go next
next
alright so i thought a little bit about the interface
uh how it should look
and uh uh we uh determined that will not be no buttons but only an l. c. d. screen so i had to uh look on that
and the design is therefore based on what we just uh uh thought of
uh first there are some new findings and new technology for speech recognition
and this is that uh um uh uh you you ask you give a question through through the device and it answers you
and they already uh put this in an in a coffee maker
and so that it you say uh good morning uh coffee maker and it says t says to you back good morning joe or what's your name
mm
this uh and there's an easy way to uh program that uh you say record into the device into the speaker and then you say the question and three seconds later you say the answer and then when you say the question it gives you the answer
mm
um perhaps it's useful perhaps for because people um lose the remote they can yell uh remote where are you and calls or something
mm
mm
it's true
and perhaps we could uh implement that
and then i have to go out of the presentation because i tried to make some kind of a a idea of how it should look like but i can't draw
oh my god
so uh don't make too much of it
i tried to uh the l. c. d. screen i tried to sort of to draw
i thought uh at least uh the icon for the volume
i don't know if there is an icon for the program but yeah
not just a p.
p. yeah just a p.
oh okay
so uh and then the buttons above and uh below the and the and the mute button also recognisable as an icon
um
where's where's the button for two
i forgot that one
okay
i thought i forgot something but uh
and uh and uh the numbers that should be a bit larger i think it's not really on scale and and so forth
ah
doesn't matter
um an options button
and i thought the the button for teletext apar uh apart because it's not really options i think
mm-hmm
it's uh options is the settings of the remote and of the t. v. and that kind of uh thing
no
yep
so could call it settings or something
but this is a bit uh how i thought it
and uh the l. c. d. uh somewhere on the remote
perhaps we could be more curvy the remote perhaps should
so that it's better in your hand or something uh
oh okay yeah
but uh and and uh a microph microphone for the speech uh recognition if we want to implement that
uh and then uh if you press the op options button now we have an example of
and then you should get the other options with what what you could do and that you could do with something like this this
oh yeah
and uh it's also uh i thought think we discussed uh earlier that uh older people don't really want to use uh these extra settings
and older people a also don't really want to use this uh th this kind of option menus
so they want to u use one button and then something happens
and not choose with uh this kind of uh and you could put in a an a really s little scrolling device on the side of your uh remote
mm-hmm
so you could scroll scroll uh across these uh things
mm
okay
that's an option
and that was my uh finding dinge
thanks
yeah
okay
now our third
go danny go danny
team member with his presentation
okay i'm going to tell you something about a trend watching
the trends from the past years what the people like what the youngsters like what the elderly people liked about shapes colours
material and stuff
'kay
the method i used was
like i told i watched the trends from the past years about colours shapes material they wanted uh from elderly and young people
so we can keep that in mind for designing f uh the device itself
findings i made
the most important thing people liked last year was that the remote control should be look look fancy
the second important thing that w should be if inv in innov innovative okay
like the l. c. d. screen that's quite innovative so that should be great meeting for this
and the third thing is it should be easy to use
i think with only one menu four button channel volume it should also be enough for easy to use
the personal preferences for the young people they liked fruity colours like uh banana yellow uh strawberry red and stuff
fruity
grass green
fruity
yeah
like that
the round shapes
and soft material m materials like the rubber
mm
it should be soft uh i it should feeling spongy or s sponge bob like things
okay
let's build it into a sponge
th
elderly people like au colours which y are being seen in autumn like um woods um dark brown red deep reds and stuff
they liked square shapes with round edges
and hard materials like wood um titanium
they those kind of materials they liked
this is a bit like the young peoples like the fruity colours
innovative all the colours you see the blue the red the white the yellow that stuff
and then i th i i personally thought the front side of the shape should be something for the youngsters like like
oh y
this or something
it's it's a bit like a banana
and the colour should be yellow or something
and for the elderly people just plain old
because we decided to have two kind of remotes two designs or was it two colours
it was one remote i think different colours
different colours yeah
we should decide whether it's going to be with round shapes
i think like my colleague you said is that's e better or for the elderly people something like like the ipod or something with round squares
simple but
easy to use
mm
so that's it
okay
so for the older people a more traditional uh form
that is my
yeah like the older o older colours i can maybe
you could you could uh change the colours that was also the idea
i don't know which shape you should should take but
yeah
colours th the elderly people
yeah i guess changing colours will be easier than changing uh
yeah
changing just the shape of the uh remote control
the shape of it
perhaps you could find something in the middle
yeah s round corners but s but square yeah
round but square
yeah
but maybe then both groups won't buy it
yeah
uh i i if you do it uh uh square
with round corners but a little uh in the middle of it uh i do you know what i mean
yeah i know what you mean kind of like a
wait like like this uh a bit
yeah
so it's a bit square but it's also a bit uh
round
kinda like a beer glass
so but then
yeah
i know what you mean
same sides
it's also easy to to have to to put in your hand
but that's uh
yeah but that's also how other remotes are shaped so that's uh but perhaps that's a good thing so that's easy to use
yeah
people know the
will recognise that's as a remote control
yeah
uh
uh when i saw your d oh
look something like that
autumn colours like red brown
they liked the wood a lot
huh
mm-hmm
so maybe we could give it like wooden loo look look or something in that colour
yeah
yeah
yeah kinda like old cars uh
and a bit bit old school style renaissance medieval kind of things
yeah
let's put it all together
swords
those kind of yeah those kind of things
so you see the big difference between the young people
fresh exciting
yeah
and the old people old and boring
but that's easily to do with the colour i think
so sorry
that's easy to do with the colours i think
yeah i think it's it's easier to do in colour than in shape
yeah
uh
because otherwise we have to get different shapes and colour way easier than yeah the shapes
yeah we think so too
in material yeah rubber rubber is like i said young people like more soft materials and spongy ones and the old people like plain wood
yeah
yeah
so we have to decide if we're going to use
real hard rubber or soft rubber
yeah think uh also in between
or something something between that
soft rubber
yeah soft rubber which you can you can feel in it
yeah i know what you um
i don't think you should be able to mould it but
or no
or or wh what's something harder
it should shouldn't be
no no no but but you have to like like like a a eraser or something
that's the bit you can press it in or something harder
yeah
uh
bit like this kind of rubber
this uh
yeah something like this yeah
but it's quite hard this
yeah it's quite hard but you can press it in
yeah
it's feels kind s spongy
spongy
hmm
something
i don't think it's rubber
no
n n n
so we need a spongy feeling
uh did you have something about uh
are you going to invite sponge bob maybe he can
yeah
so we should first decide about shape i think
ding ding
yeah i think that's the better thing to do
which uh then you can fit the l. c. d. screen in it and can decide uh
um i also s uh can't help but notice that you uh used an you had a remote control and the l. c. d. screen was uh rather small
yeah w i think that l. c. d. screen should be like
um
yeah it it's supposed to be bit s bit s bit yeah
this was your size but i think it should be larger
yeah three quarter of the of the
yeah three quarters
so uh so you don't have to put your oh
yeah the buttons won't get that small when the l. c. d. screen is
uh new blank
so uh when you get this uh
ooh
uh kinda like this
mm-hmm
or should it be larger
yeah
larger i think
larger
because you want to put your hands you want
but if you pu now you can put your hand there and then you won't touch the screen
yeah becau because you have
yeah
perhaps that's best
yeah okay true true true true
your thumb here
but not on the screen because yeah that's uh that's an idea
yeah
yeah
looks a bit like a game boy now
because when you put your f yeah but if yo if you make the the l. c. d. screen as large as the remote control itself
uh you'll you'll always get some you yeah
you always touch it yeah
yeah yeah yeah yeah
going to be very greasy and stuff
but it won't get that small because you have how much
nine ten eleven twelve thirteen fourteen fifteen buttons on the screen
yeah
one to zero the two digit
yeah you don't want it too small
how yeah how large
you have to you have to because some fat people with d thick fingers will press three buttons at same time
yeah they have thick fingers
but if you wanna make it in international japanese uh people got uh rather small hands
yeah true but yeah we have we have the zoom option right
and we got these large
zoom opt ah yeah of course yeah
you can make it larger to to uh to uh with accompanying uh greater fields to push the button
yeah
yeah
yeah
and we won't include a a pen or something to point hey we we want to do it with our fingers right
no
yeah
your fingers yeah
yeah
you don't want uh because if you lose the pen uh if you lose the pen uh you can't use
yeah
y you could include a pen
use a pen you you c you can lose the pen
yeah but i think people want to use a remote with with their fingers because th they're used to that and
yeah the fingers yeah
yeah o yeah if they think it's handy to use a pen
yeah i think this uh this is a good size for the screen
i don't know how how large the actual remote should be but a little bit like this or something
and maybe we have to add a tissue to remove the grease from all the fingers huh
yeah
yeah you can do whatever uh any uh cloth
yeah but that that can be with plain soft tissue
yeah you can buy those at
okay well maybe if i can interrupt you maybe i should uh should show some points on which we uh should take a decision
sure
so we can discuss these points
those points um
energy question mark
how how should we uh supply the thing with energy and how are we going to do it with separate docking station and then put in it
uh chip on print and case
those are points my uh coach advised me to discuss here but i hope you have ideas about them
i think energy were batteries and then uh and uh yeah
the docking station
yeah
so that's the the the first point
maybe it's better to to include rechargeable batteries which you can recharge through the docking station
we already decided that on the previous meeting
w
yeah
yeah
yeah
so if the badg the batteries are dead
mm-hmm
yeah
just like with the telephone
i kinda like your
then you can re you can uh change them
yeah you got some uh some of those uh uh wireless uh mice
yeah yeah yeah like those
mouse
computer mouse
kinda like those kind of batteries
yep
but it should be th i think normal batteries not not like two or two uh
yeah normal plain you no normal plain batteries you can buy at the supermarket or retail shop
yeah
yeah
simple rechargeable uh batteries
yeah
yeah
um what was with the chip on print
the chip on print
um
uh you gotta f yeah
i think so
chip on print with a with a simple uh a sim not a simple but a
print plate
we also discussed that
didn't we
yeah but how did this how does that with a l. c. d. screen
you still have a
print plate
uh
yeah yeah yeah
you always have a print plate
beg your pardon
you always have a print plate right
yeah sure of course yeah
mm-hmm
always so
i dunno what w what we have to decide about that
yeah well it's a good question
it just was in there and i didn't have any information about it but
well uh chip on print i think what they mean uh with the regular rubber buttons that you got
uh it's always clear for the remote control when you press uh a certain button
mm-hmm
but when you got a l. c. d. screen with no uh with not the buttons are not always on the same place
yeah okay
but
for example if you enlarge a button or if you got several options uh appearing on your screen uh the co ordinations aren't always the same
yeah
when you got a regular button th the button of stand by is always on the same place and you got on the and on the
yeah okay but the p print plate of l. l. c. d. screen is more advanced than a normal print plate
yeah
so that that's not of any discussion i think
well you need some kind of c. p. u. i guess
i suppose so
mm i don't i dunno i don't think that's
it is a simple c. p. u. but it doesn't
yeah yeah okay but i d i i don't know if nor o s it's quite a simple l. c. d.
yeah because it has to uh b
yeah it's quite a simple l. c. d. screen
i think they don't need that big of c. p. u.
yeah but it the the remote control has to know whether you're in a settings menu or just uh you just want to turn up the volume
yeah okay true true
true
so it has to have some kind of a
calculation unit or c. p. u.
to know uh in which state you are and uh which button you are pressing in at the right moment
mm-hmm
because we're projecting projecting the buttons on the l. c. d. screen
yeah
and a touch screen makes it uh possible to uh to get the co ordination of your finger on the screen
yeah
and the case yeah we already discussed the case we wanted to make it from rubber and uh
it's rubber
yeah but but a hard rubber like this
or softer rubber or yeah
uh hard rubber i think
that's the easy to ha uh to to uh
yeah
it bounces back from the floor where you throw it
yeah
yeah sure look
we have different colours
yeah yeah this in different colours
so the shapes is something between the square shapes with round colo corners and a round shapes
d
no i don't think i think
it's more round than square
yeah it's a bit
but i think it should be a bit longer perhaps
so it meets i think it meets more the young people than the older people
yeah
yeah
but that's what we want
i think so too
yeah that's our target
it's our main target
yeah
yeah
mm-hmm
lower than forty years i think
it was
well and how about my idea uh of making it um
with one single curve
oh yeah that that i think i thought that was a quite good
so i
yeah
because it's a gadget and you want to show it off of course
yeah
yeah yeah you have a fancy design then right away
yeah
uh
you can put it on your table with the l. c. d. screen you don't have to put it get it in your hand
so
because it yeah
you can put it next to you and then dive it in and
yeah
yeah that's a good idea
it's a lot easier
yeah
yeah alright
so
so so you got uh did you write that down
okay so
and then
uh got a single curved uh rubber
f uh fancy coloured remote control
you can't you you can't oh you c you can draw it on your paper and then load it on the
yeah
yeah you can uh it's pretty easy but
yeah but i wrote it down
and load it on the the user the server
and
what about the user interface there are also some some questions uh about the concepts i think you have some ideas on that
yeah i had what i just uh i should again
you you showed your drawing
i miss a few buttons but
well
at least uh what we should also have on i just remembered um a menu to go back through the first uh
if if you touch options you can't go back to this uh right away now
mm-hmm
yeah you have to go back
yeah uh uh
this
isn't it better to have the sound and the general buttons horizontal
i don't know
with the minus and the plus
i think it's
i think it's
easier than
i don't know
i i thought it was uh easier to handle this way but i don't know what they think
yeah
sorry
would you like the the buttons horizontal or v vertical
mm
for sound and channel
depends on the screen
th
if you make the screen vertical it doesn't matter
if you make it uh in a rectangle
right well if we make it like this i think if you
yeah
i so it's it's it's it's
put it like this
square
i think it's it's easier to have it something like
oh a button uh minus here plus over here
a minus here plus over here
oh okay
and on here
yeah
the other buttons and on here the top
the options and then you have something like uh the p. over here
yeah
but i think i wou
and the sound
i think that's a matter of what you're used to
something uh
i think i would put a plus and a min uh here
and then the p. in the mid in the middle and the sound uh in the middle
uh
something like
sh
take your time
plus minus plus uh
almost
minus
yeah but i think when you are holding it you could press the minus and the plus and with the other finger the minus and the plus
yeah i think you're going to s you're going to use it with one thumb
yeah but i think yeah i don't know
perhaps i have some examples
w
we'll leave that to the usability engineering then
i don't know
who's the usability engineering
that's me
she is
but i'm going to look if i've got some examples 'cause perhaps you should choose what's most often used
oh
the 'cause they can use that better
yeah
um
consistency
yeah
oh i have that those s numbers
i
here is our here are uh
or a good watch
i don't really know
b
everybody's searching in his data
yeah
channel selection
per hour one hundred and sixty eight
volume selection four times an hour
yeah but but i mean if it's usually plus or min above each other or next to each other on a normal remote
yeah
uh
so not how much n not how often it's used but
w what's what's usual or normal
yeah that depends on on on the remote
yes i'm looking here
but here's it's below here also and now here's here's next to each other
uh
i think it's it's a
i think because i have two televisions at home
one is horizontal one is vertical so it depends
yeah it does it doesn't really matter but
yeah
yeah
depends
uh
i think the the the volume was usually uh above each other because you go higher and down
yeah lower
and the the pay the the the program is next to each other because you would go further and back
true
that's how it's is usually when i look here
okay um
that's what i see
let's cut to the chase
it's got to change
yeah well i think we have we don't have to decide about that now how where we will put the buttons just the
i don't know
yeah is it is user interface
yeah
concepts
component
this concept is in the actual design but you should know where you would place a
okay well le
yeah
interface yeah
and the speech uh shall we implement that
or uh
yeah well we just heard about the new uh technology huh
yeah i think it's it's easy for that where are you but then it says i'm here
technologies uh
yeah
yeah
makes it possible to
but then you should also find a place you could if you do it like this you could put it in a corner or something
yeah
mm
you can talk into the corner
yeah a microphone yeah
not even necessary because a lotta you can make a very sensitive microphone
yeah
mm-hmm
so it makes it possible to uh just put it arou uh underneath it or on the on the bottom of the uh remote
yeah
yeah maybe at the bottom where you can can hel hold it with you hand that there's also a microphone uh
but
yeah that's also
yeah
right
over there
so in the middle or something
but that's not import i think that's not im very important because yeah it doesn't matter where the microphone is
yeah yeah
but you should uh decide where you want to put it
ah okay sure okay well tha
right
um i think where it isn't seen
underneath
the most
indeed
it shouldn't be uh very uh visible
inside
you could p you could put it in a logo of the company
yeah
yeah
yeah sure why no
well maybe just in the the spot you just pointed out
i i between the round of the r.
yeah
yeah
because i think it should be in a in an important position where people can see it
because it is the the unique uh idea of our remote huh the the speech control
yeah
yeah okay
so where do you want to put it
well maybe where the one hand
yeah but it doesn't makes it uh any more fancy because you get to see uh
yeah actually it does because it you can you can find it better if you use it
yeah
yeah bu but
it's a way for you to uh
uh
so it makes more sense just 'cause other remotes don't have that
yeah okay
but are we talking about the button or about the microphone
about a microphone there is no button
yeah because a microphone is very small thing but you can make it look like it's big so as its its really an important function of the remote
yeah
i think the left s under corner should be the best
where isn't i it isn't most in sight
yeah
okay
i think
well put it there
i don't mind
that doesn't doesn't really matter
no
actually doesn't
okay
alright
so
any more uh
so well uh type supplements
interface type
anything
yeah well we already s discussed that huh the the l. c. d. and
the l. c. d. yeah uh supplements well the supplement is to yeah
yeah
i think i thought the like you said like scroll next to the remote isn't that handy
yeah
i think it's better to just up what you'd like to do on the screen
if you want to go back you have to back button go back
yeah
if you want to choose audio settings you press audio settings and it goes to that s sub menu
hey
um yeah
yeah the the young people do like uh scroll uh yeah
use the scroll
yeah
yeah i think so too
you do like it
so why not on on side
or at least yeah i don't know if it's really the scroll but the menu they like most
and i think you can never get through a menu great with a scroll uh
fast yeah
yeah i think it is is faster
so if you've got a settings if you
becau i think the scroll's easier if you have a lot of options but if you don't have a lot of option then
yes
but you have it's f uh we have five or four or something
you have a lot of options
because when you use yeah you get w when you use uh the settings menu for example to look up some uh uh some channels on your uh on your television
y
mm-hmm
you should scroll scroll down uh on a menu which probably does not fit on your screen
uh-huh
yeah okay true
yeah
so then it's uh very handy to to scroll down you make just a rubber just like uh on your mouse or
okay
just put it on the side and it's very easy to use
okay no problem
and i think i would it would make even more fancy because you have another interesting thing on the side which you can touch and
yeah yeah
yeah
it's also different
yeah
yeah
okay
okay
well there's our five minutes uh warning
um any more uh questions about about the design or the user interface or different components everyone
um
no colours are clear shape is clear material is clear
everybody think they can can
okay what's the standard colour
work for that
and a standard yeah we don't no we have different colour
is there a standard colour
i i you got you got different colours but you should have a standard colour
how many colours are we going to
you should you should have a black one because uh i think black is standard
black
yeah black i think is is the standard
black
with the with the yellow uh
but if you want to be different then uh
dark grey something like this this colour or something
just a regular uh remote colour
yeah like like yeah
and then have uh different covers uh to use
or or silver
i think it's better to have silver nowadays
silver yeah
silver
i think you see more silver than black
yeah
you see a lot of t uh silver televisions
but still silver and black are well silver is new but also traditional so uh
silver rubber
yeah the the silver black are our main colours
yeah
i think we have silver black and between those is like i dunno s five colours between them or something
yeah w what about a yellow thing i mean it
yeah y i think it's better to
yeah yeah yeah it'll be a banana yellow we have
could be ugly but it's definitely fancy
r red
but yeah
yeah th yeah
that's right
green wood brown
but if you use uh silver uh rubber s silver rubber isn't fancy
yeah
true
when you use titanium silver is fancy but when you use silver rubber it isn't fancy
yeah
silver has to shine and rubber doesn't shine
mm-hmm
especially when it's made of soft rubber like this
yeah
you understand
yeah i understand
yeah i would think about colours like uh red yellow green blue just
yeah o of course
yeah
the fruity colours and the autumn colours like red and brown dark red and brown
fruity
yeah
just all kind of colour
fruity loops
mm-hmm
maroon
yeah
yeah
okay
okay so
and and do we have to have a normal black one or uh
who's pinging
is it
no
you are pingin okay
you ping
i thought we okay so uh that wraps it up
everybody knows uh what to do
yeah
well i wrote it down here
well not what to do
well i don't know what to do but
i wrote it down here what to do um
not what to do
look
the next meeting is once again in thirty minutes
okay
um here are the individual actions
and especially notice that uh the industrial designer and the user interface designer are going to work together on a prototype drawing on a smart board
ooh
right
s tough
yeah
and of course to all four of us uh specific instructions will be emailed by our personal coach
we'll be available
but do we have to we'll work together but do we have to stay here or do we
well i i'd say just wait uh for email and uh find out
right
yes
i don't know
okay
thin i think we should work
okay well that was what i had to say uh
yeah i think
final thoughts from anyone or
no
no
we're finished
okay well thank you very much
yeah
finished
thank you very much
so we have to keep talking english now
good
beep
oh
what
so well uh welcome everyone
yeah
um as you may have noticed i uh
created separate folders because it was uh tending to get a little busy in our uh shared project documents uh folder
yeah
i don't know if everybody uh put their own uh documents in the right folder which is for now the detailed design meeting
that's new one
we didn't make any uh
yeah
uh we should save that one
oh in
then i'll move this one
didn't we just do that
yeah save in the folder
oh
save as project
oh no this is just one big document so you can leave that wherever it is
oh okay
hmm-hmm
and we have a evaluation left here
okay
agenda
well not main documents this time
hmm
oh uh yes
i have it open myself i guess
um well the detailed design meeting huh
we're finally getting somewhere hopefully
um what are we going to do
i've opened it already
um i'm still going to take some minutes and if i'm right you two are going to give a prototype presentation
oh sorry
we could
aren't you
yes you are
and uh m did you do something with evaluation criteria
yep
yep
good
and we have a correct agenda
and uh then we have to look at something which is less nice the finance uh aspect whether we can afford what we have designed
and if we can we can uh commence the final part which is the production or project evaluation
oops
how did we work together and what are the results and how happy are we with those
okay well finance uh will be later
now i'd like to give the word to you two
yeah
okay
get up stand up
well uh we made a prototype
just 'kay
we first start with the overall uh
this is about the total remote control
view
we made it green
just example colour so uh there's one of the colours we would like to uh see in our prototype
yeah
it's a fresh colour
and uh the screen light blue
oh uh this the scroll button and the microphone on the on the sides here under
and the r. and r. logo it just says r. and r. now but uh
okay
any questions so far
big microphone
yeah just uh just an idea about how to m th that could also be possible
yeah
oh okay
that's the place where it's going to be not the size
uh well it's an idea in a so
yeah
oh y you perhaps you should make it a bit big so people know it's there and uh
do not forget it
uh
mm-hmm
to function it it doesn't really have to be sm uh big of course
yeah okay
hmm
the microphone could be just a minor uh hole uh on the left uh button
of course
mm
mm th yeah
small
okay um
we also made some uh ideas about how uh the options menu would work
uh using the scroll button on sides uh y uh i uh um
you push the scroll button and it's claps out if there's a
yeah you push the scroll button
and a drop down menu or a pull out menu comes out and uh you get uh you get the options uh becoming available
for example uh t. v. settings uh remote settings et cetera
remote settings et cetera
yeah
so uh you can scroll down too with the scroll uh button uh as you can see oh it's here just push it in
uh the menu comes out like this and uh i it all becomes visible
yeah
um
and you could also touch it so that it comes out and and use the the the scroll thing as a with your fingers
yeah that's c yeah
indeed
yes
okay um it's also uh nice to see that um we made a small uh menu
uh the options menu uh becoming available when pressing the uh scroll uh button
and the opportunity to use the teletext
whi which is used uh which should still be used and we think that it's uh very handy to put it uh not uh under the options menu
but in uh yes
in an apart uh
yeah
so a separate button for for text okay
in a separate button yeah
yeah
perhaps we should use the teletext sign in p yeah
a sign yeah just like okay indeed
yeah
okay we can uh modify that later
forgot
okay
would you like to make any comments about next uh
uh well this is the total interface uh that f of the l. c. d. screen
uh the numbers which is pretty straight forward
we put ano an an extra button in
we can erase it but it's the button where you can switch channels
just when you are one and you go to two you can or if you go to five you can go back to one with that button
yeah that one yeah
previous page yeah indeed
it has a name
and uh uh we put that in i thought it would be handy there
oh my god
uh this the one number or two numbers button
below that the page and the sound
and uh in the middle the the mute
uh battery indicator
it's quite large
it's it's a bit big
and this is the uh the on off uh knop the stand by uh knop
or at least it should look like it
and the options uh of teletext
okay
you can see very clearly now that the uh teletext and options menu isn't uh taking uh much uh uh it's taking much part of the screen
so it's very uh when you uh when you use it doesn't uh become irritating to see
'cause if you put it on the top you always get see the the options menu
huh
'cause people regularly uh read from left top to right down so
mm-hmm
yeah
well this about it i think
okay
yeah
huh
thank you
i will put it back on the on the nice green
looks good
and i just missed when i was typing the r. r. stands for
that's the logo of the yeah
logo okay
it's th th right now it's only r. r. but uh
okay well
full screen
i would have recognised it if it were the right colours of course
shit
yeah
alright
sorry
'kay
okay the evaluation criteria huh
oh full screen yeah
huh
evaluation
'kay my task was this time to put up a questionnaire
by which we can evaluate the design of the remote control by the questions we requirements from the of the users
my name my job okay
my name my job
the methods
questionnaire with seven point scale from one to seven from true to false
like question is remote big enough we can say it's true or it's false by steps
right
one means absolutely not true seven means true
yeah
the three important things of refa are uh from th of this year is are is the remote control fancy enough
sorry you used the powerpoint
yeah
is it in innovative enough and is it easy enough to use
and then evaluation itself
uh
what
so
bling
okay
yeah
first question
is the design fancy enough
well
project manager what do you think
well it's looks fancy especially with the green colour
yeah
but does it
and the the curves which we decided huh
yeah
only what happened to the single curve
we spoke about last meeting
now uh the single curved idea was uh
it uh oh it's in the background
oh
yeah okay you ge um
y you should make uh a sideways uh view
yeah
the sideways view uh that that that ma
it will be i guess
oh we can
ho not that pen
not that pen
oh g i would smart board
well it might work one time huh
uh can i draw here or uh
suppose so
think
ooh
ah
yeah yeah you can
oh my god it works
so it would be uh something like this from the side but with a bit of uh curve here right
yeah that's the single curve indeed
yeah
so if you v flip it like this
yep
okay
here's yeah
that's not very i it's also uh very handy if you make a side curve way to make the the remote control very thin at the bottom uh at a bottom at a bottom
uh make it uh rather thick on the top because uh on the top it has uh the screen
which takes uh in some uh space and the batteries can be located over there so uh
yeah
so you just make the back of this part a bit bigger so that it lays a bit o
yeah
isn't going to be a little bit heavy at the top
yeah that's a bit of problem maybe
no
with two batteries the whole print plate and t and top and if you're holding it quite a lot i think
yeah
i think yeah the battery should be in here because it's just nothing so if you could
yeah
yeah
okay indeed
yeah
yeah
'cause otherwise i think i
okay but we have to rate uh these things now
yeah we have to rate
is it fancy enough
okay
true is one false is seven
so fancy enough means does it comes to the younger people and the elder people
i think it does
i think so
i think
i if you don't make it green then the elder people won't won't like it
it's pretty fancy
yeah i have to agree all the colour colours don don doesn't matter that m that much now it's only design
you get th
yeah
mm-hmm
i think it does
yeah
and the design
well i think uh especially because of the microphone and the l. c. d. screen also
yeah
yeah
i don't know whether older people will use it but
very new thing
well
so
fancy the old people will
i would make it a two or something
a two
yeah
it's true it's a one
huh
alright it's a one
very fancy
oh it's a one
no it's a two
little bit strange we have to judge that ourselves huh
yeah i n used i wouldn i should use that one but it doesn't
yeah
but it's a one uh maybe uh
okay no it's two
true is a one
yeah
very true is it very true or isn't that true
well i'd say two on a scale
well they think it's very true but uh
it's very true because we designed it to be very fancy so
yeah i think two
yeah but
it's very fancy i think
we should perhaps
have you ever seen a remote control like this
no okay well that's true
no okay so so it's fancy
that's fancy enough
that not
yeah
then
okay one two
that doesn't matter that much so make it a one
okay
yeah
let's give it a two
is it innovative
i think it is because it has an l. c. d. screen a mi microphone
enough
yeah m
and uh uh the scroll is rubber so s
we have for the search function
it's from rubber
yeah
the scroller a bit i think it's it's a one yeah
eno enough to i think
it's a one i think
true
also huh uh-huh the buttons are they easy to find
that was a big requirement of the old people
yeah because they're right on your screen
so you can use the b the the arrows
huh
they're right on your screen so i don't know where you'd search
with the ones
are all the buttons easy to find
yeah
not only this buttons all the buttons
well i think they are
the options are it uh little bit harder but if you touch the options then it's uh
yeah
take a harder look yeah sure
i think th it's
it's easier than the regular uh remote control
easy t
yeah i think this is easy now
yeah and you use these buttons the most huh
i think th i think the options buttons are not the the easiest way to to
yeah
so
no they're not but they're they're they are easy to find
to handle
true
i would rate it a
yeah
they are a lot easier to find than uh th than on the regular remote controls where you have to uh find out what which sign or icon means on uh every button
oh
yeah okay that's true that's true
yeah
so you have t you have to use the the the manual to understand most yeah
so which
but that's that's vantage of l. c. d. screen you can have text
so which number are we going to fill in
i would say yeah
i think it's uh it's a two at least
yeah
yeah you can make it a two
a two yeah
two three and what do you think
yeah
it's not perfect but
i think it's a three
a three
okay so we have two two three
and why is that
i personally think because i d i don't think i maybe it's easy to use it has to be easy to find right away
i i think if you have the button at the right i don't think you can find the option button that easy
yeah but you don't have t have to use the button on the right
you can touch it
you can touch it
yeah
it said bo both the options
you you can touch options
yeah okay but you have y then you have here s written option on here the teletext button right
yeah
yeah
okay then okay good
then i think also two yeah
you can touch options and it's comes out
a two okay because we have to
yep
a two a two
the uh the um below
it's the box below it huh
uh the next question the next question
oh my god
otherwise we have two results in one question
it's different
okay next question
it's easy to use as well for younger as elderl elderly people
for young people i think it's easy to use
young means sixteen to forty years
yeah i was uh yeah
and elderly from forty eight to their death
yeah
i think it's
i think it's the most useful uh remote control ever to be manufactured
in the entire mankind
okay you're very enthusiastic about your own design huh
also if you're sixty years old
yeah but because it has the regular uh controls li uh as you can see in the screen now and uh
you don't have all the other options uh always uh on your screen
so it's t i think it's really easy to use
yeah
you want these options to
also
as well for the for the older people
yeah as well as your if you're fif sixty years old you're holding one of those things in your hand
uh sure
yeah but uh
yeah but they they don't want the uh extra options right
no but we're going to th make this f for a all kind of people so it it it has to be
so
and would it be easy for them to use the speech recognition
yeah okay but so they could
uh i think it is
if they read a manual
because that might yeah
if you read the manual always
okay well
perhaps that is one of the most uh
yeah alright
m maybe that's the most user friendly and easy to use
because it it's not it's not it's it's not uh difficult
uh because a lot of
you say you say uh record to to the to the speech recognition then you say the question and the answer
channel one channel four yeah
and that's everything it does the speech recognition
yeah well maybe that would make it even more easy to use for them
yeah
i think it would make it uh
yeah i think it does
so
because all the people who can't uh
i would make it two
also two
yeah
not a seven for this
uh a two
sure two
three
oh
i'd say three
i would also say three
oh
okay so we have three three two two or
you
two
oh
well
so what are we going to do
two and a half
okay a three i see
give me more
uh
three
no
another question
remotes overwhelmed with buttons
no
no
no
no that that's that's yeah
but um i mean that's definitely one
tha that's a one i think that's definitely a one
that's definitely our uh
oh nee oh seven is it
it is
no
oh yeah
yeah uh the remote score
a false yeah
yeah
yeah but i think you should make it one scale with with one being good and seven being bad
yeah i think isn't this has to be something like isn't overwhelmed
because otherwise we can't uh calculate anything from the results so
it's not overwhelmed
yeah
yeah indeed
true
okay a one because we designed for that huh
yep
remote control has uh colours that different that meet different target groups
yes
'cause we make them in different colours so that they uh
yeah
yeah is optional
yeah
that's true
yeah and i though w we had about single colours but you can also make uh a wood colour
not just one single colour but a wood like thing can't you
yeah
huh
that it that it looks like wood like something yeah
also with rubber
uh i think you can
whether it looks like wood it isn't w it isn't wood but
yeah okay
it it feels like rubber but
you can make a print on rubber can't you
yeah
yeah
yeah
well but then when you scratch it it does come off
so that's a one then huh
that's a one
okay
yeah it is it is harder to
so that's a bit
do you have many questions
uh i have
to like
oh okay well
oh we have time
geez
yeah but we have we also we have to get to the money
we're getting paid
we're getting paid
the material used is spongy that that's uh that's a one that's m rubber
what
what spongy
yeah yeah it's very spongy
uh
yeah i th think it's not the most spongy thing
oh but not it's not very spongy because it's hard rubber
i think it's a three
yeah it's a three because you want to make it uh rather flexible but not too flexible because it has a l. c. d. screen
yeah
uh-huh yeah
hard but
yeah
you can break it
yeah
remote control is hard to lose
hard to lose yeah it sh and it's easy to find
y yeah you could you could call it
y you can't you can't lose it if you're sixty years old
if first time see the thing you didn didn't adjust uh set the microphone and then you lose it then you have lost it
yeah y you can lose it but it isn't hard to lose
it isn't hard no
i think i think this is a two personally
two
that it's hard to lose
no
yeah it it is there's the it's a six you think
isn't hard to lose
yeah so isn't hard to lose you
isn't hard to lose yeah
isn't hard to lose
so it's a two
yeah you can lose it so i don't you can make it a three i
yeah
you can't lose it
it does have an a built in function
or if you're you're sixty years old your demands
yeah but a har
a hard to lose is good
so it should this question should be hard to lose
nee
hard to lose
it's difficult to lose it
oh right
yeah this this is hard to lose
it is hard to lose
yeah so then this is it is almost true so a two
this
i think yeah i think also
a two
a two
two yeah
okay
and most all because of the option to whoa
huh
ooh
yeah it's okay
that happens above also
oh
uh
but maybe when you scroll away and back it will be normal but
yeah
oh okay
yep
no
oh it isn't well okay
oh well it doesn't
put the cor cursor on the
remember
okay okay okay
remote control mainly be sold to younger people
click
true
i think it will yeah
yeah
true
true
very true
uh yeah
uh well i a a two
no i don't think very true because the colours
uh
there
we have the colours
um we have the buttons is aren't that that much
materials yeah
nah the material isn't that
it's it's much more younger
uh okay
so i don i think i think it's a three
so ma uh make it make it a two
well i think it's it's uh a lower number so better because w we designed it for young people especially didn't we
yeah
yeah but i uh
i think it's a two but
okay okay
what do you think
i think because yeah
questions
a two
i think it's two
two
i think it's two too two too too
uh-huh
two two two
let's make everything a two
in the features
dissatisfy younger people
younger people
um
it has
well perhaps not
what did
because younger peoples are cr critical and they wanted a lot of features on this thing
yeah
well that it doesn't
well n not exactly but uh uh if it had some games on it or something like that
yeah bu but
but it's for a remote control i think it i it would satisfy those needs
i think they like the speech
yeah the speech possibility the colours
you could call to your uh yeah and the screen yeah
l. c. d. screen and scroll
scroll options yeah
i i think they'll be quite met with their expectations
yeah but those are more fancy functions not not really many features or something
right that that that those are features
no
it has relatively few features with
it's three features basically the l. c. d. touch screen is feature
yeah
the microphone is a feature
no aren't the features the microphone's feature and that you can change the channel's feature
and that you can change the volume is feature and that you can change the options of the remote uh uh something like that
yeah
yeah okay
ours had other features with
i think yeah and then you have the audio settings channel setting video settings
yeah
the easy volume up button
those are features
remote younger people usually use the remote control to put on the volume
yeah yeah
turn uh turn up the volume
so i've chos i shou i think it's it's it's a one
enough features
personally yeah
i think once you've 'cause you have the channel features b uh you have the uh screen features audio features
the you have all buttons on it which you'd like microphone extra l. c. d. screen extra scroll
thing extra
yeah
okay you think one what do you think
i think two or three
you
three yeah
two
i'd say three so two it is then or
yeah
yeah uh a two a two
make it make it a two
one two three
or make it uh a fucking two
just another two
we like two
right
you can see the remote control is r. and r.
yeah there's r. and r. in front
uh
yeah
yep
uh it's not the colour so maybe you should make two but it has r. and r.
has oh yeah do did have nah y you have the black one
and we'll probably make also a yellow one
yeah
yeah but not r. and r. yellow i think
yeah
yeah maybe maybe two
well m th but the logo is on on the front so a two yeah that's
maybe two
okay true yeah
one d on i it's the colours and the
x. marks spot
and the menu is avail that is available is easy to use
i think it is but i don't know what you think
i think it's easier to use than a regular remote control because when you push on the options menu
yeah tha that's so true
you get the the the various options uh entirely explained
mm-hmm
entirely explained
instead of uh just finding out what an icon means on a button
mm-hmm
yeah uh
and you can navigate easier because wi with the you have to push the the the arrows and with a normal t. v. uh remote
yeah you can navigate
uh
i think that wou that would be quite hard to learn to use it
you're not satisfied okay
no i'm not not convinc
let's start over again then
yeah
let's make a different remote
let's go th for i think it would be a t yeah two
well
menu
a two
now lower
a two
oh well that's that's pretty good huh
we only have twos
oh yeah i think so
yeah
uh just twos
so okay we have one three a one that that have to got up
and three
one three and a few ones
two threes
two two two two two
we m mostly have twos so it's pretty good
so two yeah
the average is a two
yeah
that is quite good
the average
yeah
i think so too
in my opinion
yeah i think so
that
we can be happy
ooh
save
ooh
yeah
what is it
it's like a bug or something
it's a fly
a fly yeah
oh m
a f butterfly
top
yeah
that's it
okay
that was your evaluation uh show okay so we don't have to calculate anything because of um these results
yes
sure
no it's two
okay good
the average is two
it's good
um let's see oh it isn't asked to save but it did already
yeah
yeah
yeah i uh uh i uh saved it
exactly
and this
everything okay
well the next part uh might be a little bit
difficult to do
in a group but i am willing to try it
because we are going to look at the finance and i have a nice excel sheet to do that
yeah
redesign
and um i'm not sure if i put it in the project folder
no
look on that
um and we're going to calculate the production costs and if they are uh under or at twelve euro fifty
yeah
we're good and if they're not we're going to uh re design but we have to do that uh very very quick i think yes
yeah
so we're going to erase features or something
um i don't know if i
do you have the cost or uh
put the excel sheet in the
let's hope
n not in the
f fifty five euros
we're going to be here at eight o'clock
folder
i think it's
i think it's still in my own documents folder
we're goin still going to be here at eight o'clock
no
i doubt it
oh shit
perhaps we've got features that don't exist in the excel sheet
yeah mm yeah maybe
so
no it was in my uh my information so uh
the microphone
yeah
it i it wasn't too much
yeah
yeah
maybe you're going scrap scrap it
as well as the l. c. d. screen
whoa
okay well this is it
well if it doesn't work
um maybe i could ask one of you to uh fill it in so that i can also uh take minutes
i want to fill it in but uh
no prob
and uh maybe the other can uh use that thing to count uh numerous functions
ah
but you should uh direct
count it
li like write it be
well we have to count some things and we have to think about some things
count it
but you have to fill in this column huh
you got excel to count
the number of
no uh count uh number of functions because for every button you have to pay and there are different screen shots
oh okay
well i dra uh danny danny i'll do that because i draw the uh
ah okay cool
so or different different screens so
huh
yeah
oh yea yeah you design it
we've got a battery one or t two batteries or not
um
nee one battery with two small batteries
yeah
yeah but it's it's more about the energy source huh
do you use a hand dynamo a battery kinetic or solar cells
yeah
i would do a battery we do
solar cell
right
no it took a battery
a battery
we'll wait
no no solar cell no no no no
one battery right
yeah
no hand dynamo
yeah
electronics simple chip advanced chip right
hand
we have
no we have sample speaker
on advanced chip
but b al but we also have sample speaker do
yeah yeah
yeah so this one and this one
uh we ha we have um single what
oh we already on nine
are we
oh yay
we have double curved
the single
single nee single curved
single
double curved was uh uh see uh ju three dimensional
but it isn't three dimensional it isn't curved in a l
this one is
oh the the it's not going to work uh people
we have rubber
this one is curved like this right
i'll just fill it in
it's curved like this
no no no single curved is like this
um rubber indeed
yeah bu what
uh that's the only curve you made not th uh curved like that
that's uh
oh but we have curves like it and it
there are two curves right
thirteen
oh okay i understand i understand
huh
with a scroll wheel right
rubber
yeah
is he integrated
no eh
i don't know
push button
yeah we gotta integrate scroll wheel and push button because when you push it and you w it won't just pu uh makes possible to s
no we don't have push button
oh yeah right we want it to it's not it's not no
l. c. d. display
not going to work
okay
yep
fifteen oh too bad
okay um
oh but with special colour we have
a special form right
but now button supplements
we don't got the button supplements
oh we don't have any buttons so yeah we need to uh
eighteen and a half damn
we have to lower it with six points
damn
no uh we have fifteen and oh right
okay
twelve and half
we could lose the curve
nah
we could use
yeah i would lose the curve
we could lose the scroll wheel
you could make it just a regular scroll wheel
but you can't push it so you have to tap
yeah
if you can't push it you have to tap the the options window uh button here and then uh scroll down with the d with uh with uh the button
yeah alright
yeah i think that will be
so normal scroll wheel
our best bet
normal scroll wheel
and i think we should lose the curve
i think we should scrap the sample speaker
lose
it's four pri it four units
yeah but if you would i it is a new feature it it's something special
okay so we don't exactly need the single we don't need a curve
but w d wha
no the curve doesn't really
's possible to lose curve
curved then it will be square
no then it will won't uh stand up from the table
then it would just
okay
was that does that mean to it single curve
yeah that's meant with scr uh with s curve
yeah
the curve is uh in a dimension
okay
if you make it a flat one s n it's no curve you got no curves
so
we would lose this one
yeah but tha that that only is one
yeah okay
yeah we could s yeah a bit
no two
no one
sixteen point three
oh okay indeed
so we don't yeah we also have to
so we still
is it possible to make
could could we do it on a regular chip on print or something
no otherwise we don't have an l. c. d. screen
no
ma y you just can't do that or uh
no
and what did you change
you changed the uh scroll wheel and
we changed th
yeah and the single curved to uncurved
single curved
oh but it's just one
flat
yeah so that does doesn't doesn't that mu i think
point so maybe you should should uh
no
scrap sample speaker
yeah you should you should drop the speech recognition
that that's uh
the sample speaker is two d wait f s four points
yeah but it's t
yes four points
yeah but it is uh it it is a new feature it is something special
and then you can keep the curve
or can't you
yeah uh becau uh when you lose the
yeah but what what else what else uh do you want to scrap
f you have to we have to scrap four points
i don't know
yeah that's difficult
yeah
or make it on a hand dynamo but i don't think that will work
yeah
ma make it with wood instead of rubber
no that's no
make it w uh when you made it uh uh uh a remote control of wood
uh
we could make it titanium instead of rubber
you don't make a remote control of ah
yeah it it i yeah it also uh it also takes one point less
yeah mm-hmm
yeah but uh a wooden remote control only helps for uh old people we discussed yes
oh
oh can i ask something
what is special colour
yeah
is that the wood uh wood uh this we have to have that one too
i think it is
it isn't
what
yeah
yeah but it's only a half
but i think the only option is to drop the uh sample speaker
yeah
sample speaker
to knock the sample speaker yeah
and sample sensor
th then we still have too much
yeah okay three
if we use the uh
but m yeah course but what we'll have
point three
yeah we we scrap that one
huh
let's make it thirteen or fourteen
point twelve
see a po three
we need point three
that's a scroll wheel
uh it's a colour
don't make it wood
a colour
yeah but a wood we can make it brown dark brown not wood
make it uh
yeah but it's it's special colour is it
yeah special colours fruity colours
a all kind of colours
it's also green or uh
is it also no that that's just normal colour fruit colours
yeah
normal colours yellow
yeah but it's a special colour than just rubber colour
you have to add something to the rubber to make it green
yeah
you don't say here's green rubber
they don't sell green rubber plants
yeah but then i d i don't think we can ever make to a twelve and half
alright
yeah you can you should you have to lose
but then we have to scrap l. c. d. display we have to scrap uh
no it is the scroll wheel i guess
no no no
s advanced chip
no then we have to scrap everything we got because how many colours we gonna make
five
if we lose the scroll wheel and make it totally uh depending uh dependent on uh the touch screen
then we have two
s touch
a push yeah
then it's possible to make
then we can make add two colours on it
and then you can and then you can add to the colours
yeah two colours it
special c okay if you lose uh if you lose the
switch colours
it was such a great idea
you lose this one you got eleven point five and you make i and then you can make uh the spec single curve for example
they can add two colours
but the colours
um how ma uh the colours like l she told
is that all the colours we add or
how d uh uh how many colours
what do you mean
special colours all the colours you want because you want to make p
yeah but we we we are we have yellow red uh black titanium
yeah but uh when you use more than one colour it's a special colour
ah okay
oh
but i think when you use the colour that's not originally the rubber then you use special colour 'cause you have to add it
i suppose
yeah
yeah but the rubbers alls original black
yeah so you always lose the special colour
you co you could make it always black like normal remote
yeah b
yeah but we're gonna make it yellow uh red and then you add you have two special colours on top of the one we have now
nee we we also want to make ano another colour
oh right yeah
yeah we should u yeah
yeah but m
we have to make this like four or five or something
yeah because we have more colours than only black
that's what it means
yeah but isn't it per remote that you pay
yeah
i then i think i p i don i don't think they me mean they're special
oh right yeah
half
is it per remote
i think you pay half per remote
yeah
yeah that's right and you one colour per remote
so each remote with a special colour
yeah indeed yeah
so then it is one
you don't need four of those uh four of those special colours in one in one remote
yeah okay okay true
true true
no
i hope
we have two points spare
so the battery we have um advanced chip on print
nee one point
one
so it would be curved single curve
because of thing yeah well you can at least make it curved again
or not
hmm
so y you just can't make a nice remote
yeah single curve
because that was very important huh
it's too bad for the speaker
so it's curved it's still that so we we dropped the speech recognition together with the speaker
should we change that tha that that's a one if not or not
mm yep
we dropped the scroll wheel
could you copy it
and make it uh
and the rest is the same huh
y yea the scroll wheel is dropped
am i right
yes
the entire uh
uh
yep
huh
perhaps you can then copy page or so
ooh
no
okay
oh you you made the entire could you
undo undo
undo
oh not well
so 'kay
twenty minutes
would you
by the perhaps you can save this one and then copy or something
add it copy page
select all
no but you c yeah
alright something went wrong
tap
okay but this this new remote we can afford
it doesn't work
let's forget
it should've work
okay so you had this list at start
alright
hmm
no i hadn't
when did you receive this list
i just received it
ah okay
yeah
oh ignore that
they don't work so hard at the finance department
ah okay
well so
i suppose this is a
okay so we lose the scroll wheel the s
too bad
yeah
the microphone
yeah and that's it
yeah
and the microphone
a and we changed something i guess or not
we
oh no
yep
okay
twelve euro fifty
um and did you try to make a new design or what were you trying to do
yeah i tried to copy that one but it didn't work
it didn't work
so we could fix it like tha that it's like this
hmm
strange
you could select it all but then you can't erase
strange
oh you can arrange
you can only re erase
erase
oh
when you saw th li uh earlier when we selected it w i couldn't erase anything
uh no
hmm can't you then just say copy
bling
new page
paste
yes
ah
select none
just tap somewhere
just tap somewhere
just up somewhere b uh besides it right
okay and now you can erase
yeah
i don't think i can but uh we can try
uh we already try
well it should be possible
oh yeah no ha ha
oh no
well you can draw over it with white uh pen
no
yeah we tried it earlier
oh
it's very much work
yeah
sorry
well but that's also useful for the evaluation
because i think uh we have a prototype now which we can afford and uh we only need to draw a little bit to get a good uh
evaluation drops
design
doodle
and i think we should then move on to the production evaluation because of the time
and erase the mic
yeah goodbye mic
all i need is no mic
let's see we can save this now
oh i already erased half of the line
bon chance
and move back to here
too bad oh
like this
mm-hmm
still looks nice
and then all green
okay well thank you
oh that's erase
looks like a ipod
oh no
no add
hey but you can erase that
yeah that's a bit weird
yeah
uh oh
oh now i'm line
s difference between lines and text and the pen
yeah
oh
right
all i need is mic
and you can't erase this
hmm strange
no it's weird
okay well uh just leave it at this and quickly save
station page
um and then we are going to the project or product evaluation
huh looks fucking boring now
we just did our project evaluation
um well i think i can sit for that since it's almost my final slide
um
what did you think about uh the process
how satisfied are we
deadlines were sometimes very short
yeah
mm-hmm
bu but stressful
but and stressful
you think no my presentation isn't ready
yeah
i think we it should be b it would be better if we worked a little bit together
yeah
now we worked through each other something he said yeah and you had information i also had
yeah
and you could ask things
yeah you had information i didn't have and then uh
oh right
so some some things i had in my presentation they already told so
yeah
yeah
yeah
and for me it sometimes was a surprise who was going to present what huh
yeah
and uh
so yeah that i don't think that is the best way to work at for such project
yeah
no
so you would say uh communicate during our individual uh work
yeah no or maybe session of five minutes together or something and then work separate
yeah but but why not work here together for example
yeah
yeah you could
why should we be separated from each other in those difference uh different rooms
yeah
yeah
yeah
mm-hmm
well probably to simulate the whole working uh process huh th you can't have a meeting uh for several weeks
i think so too
yeah
yeah but then you can work together too when
yeah m yeah like she told
then you can work together too by mail or by i dunno chat something but now we're completely separated from each other
huh oh right
no
a chat would also be uh
i don't think that was the best way but
but the technology was uh fantastic
yeah the technology's okay
well i i don't really like the board it doesn't really work great
work now
yeah okay but i don i do i think becau that's because
sometimes i think
perhaps it is e
it does work but sometimes it doesn't erase or it doesn't uh
yeah perhaps it is easier to get one of those uh dig digital pens or so and to uh and lay it next to that keyboard over there
yeah
yeah
so you can draw uh see it over th on the screen
yeah like the f like a plotters or something yeah
yeah
yeah
yep yep yep yep yep
so you don't think the smartboard is is really useful or
but
it's useful but not m
well it is useful but it doesn't really work all the time
yeah it is useful but
no
because when you put this pen on the screen uh uh for exam and line is d being drawn at at two or three centimetres uh below
th the pen doesn't
the line is a bit off
yeah so it's maybe a bit unnatural also
yep
alright
yeah you can point to where you want the line to be
but
the project uh because of the deadlines you didn't had the time to uh have you didn't have time to uh to make a very uh
qualitati qualitative uh presentation
yeah
so you used uh this
uh the different powerpoint presentations uh in which you put your uh material in the
oh
that wasn't me
wasn't me
yeah
uh so um the means we discussed the smart board and what about uh this digital pen
i
i didn't use it at all
i i used it it it was you can use it it's quite handy i think
yeah well i use it as a a normal pen and and and only you use it to uh get it on the computer huh
but i didn't i uh
yeah i used it to y to yeah it did work pretty well
i used it too but oh well
i didn't use
yeah
i don't think why you would want to use it actually but it it does work
yeah because it shou
no yeah
to make some designs it is very easy
yeah
it is it is yeah it is easy for to design something and then load it in your computer
yeah
yeah and then you can show it to everybody
yeah
but to write it th yeah
yeah
it's b bi little bit too big to write
it doesn't really write normally
it's a bit
yeah it's too big it's too fat
yeah
yeah
yeah
fat document those
okay um
and what about the teamwork
team work was okay
i think it was great yeah
yeah
yeah well i think so too
only thing that we worked through past each other
we
right
yeah but that was it was our assignment huh
with some things that was only problem but
yeah but it was because we didn't uh yeah
yeah yeah yeah but furthermore better
okay and maybe i should walk out of the room when you discuss uh this point the leadership
that's yeah no prob
i thought it was good but uh yeah
yeah
ah
yeah well okay
yeah
not too much not too too too too
yeah
yeah
okay
and creativity
well when we look at this i'd say we have been creative huh
but
well
yeah or the room for it was the idea to be creative so
there was room for
yeah
you got some standard ideas in your head and this what came out
mm-hmm
and you get get stuff from the from the computer but
yeah
the information uh was sometimes uh a little bit too late or
little bit uh lo yeah
yeah
too late it it it took a lot of time before you got your ema yeah
you just sit there for ten minutes
yeah
yeah where is that email
i played i think seven times solitaire something
oh did you
you did
well i didn't have time for that
is it on there
wha
is it on there
i didn't find the didn't look but uh i didn't look but
at some times i sometimes i received like like five emails at at one moment and then
oh right it is there
was searching and searching
no i i never got that
i always
i got like one email after ten minutes or something
n yeah
i even got spam
or something like that
that's what we said
so does this i think lik oh and information was a bit low i think
and it not a lot uh
sometimes in in in in the beginning i didn't understand what what to do
no the first one
no w i didn't know
yeah like i with with the remote and i never new we have t we had to uh yeah made a made a rec a remote control
i didn't know uh
make a r yeah
nee
and i didn't know what to do for the first ten minutes before we got here so i went right
yeah so
yeah
no stepping on the table and then looking at the internet page
yeah
and i was working and working and work okay well um but after all we can say uh we are satisfied but it it could've been uh better
just looking at the screen and uh
no
so yeah
yeah
when we get uh when we have we would have gotten uh more information
mm-hmm
yeah an
yeah more information about the costs
faster
yeah
yeah that will be handy
first of all i didn't think uh that we were able to make an l. c. d. screen uh first point but uh it was possible uh uh yeah
yeah
yeah it only costs four units
uh yeah
yea uh so tha actually you could make an l. c. d. screen but no mic or it could make mic but no l. c. d. screen when you look at that
yeah
yeah that was a bit mean to put it in the end
yeah
yeah
and uh what were the other points to to improve this whole process
uh i dunno
um
yeah
think that's about it
nothing
hmm
i think we got it already
heavier um less heavy laptops
yeah they're pretty heavy
yeah
uh
faster laptop
yeah
uh
they were they were just fine
but that's not really uh
and furthermore the the the network was okay
yeah
everything you loaded was also
uh
yeah everything worked
av available there
right
and so more time uh w might have improved the the quality of work is what you say
so
yeah
yeah
okay
yeah but that
it's now half past four half past three so
yeah but it's just the the off hours between that you will work alone
yeah okay
yeah okay
then it pops up pop up screen came
mm hm
five minutes in the meeting
mm
yeah
mm
no
okay so more time during the individual work phases
huh
um okay well uh i just got my warning for the last five minutes
you did
so i'll move on to i guess my last slide yes which is the closing
well
well uh we managed but we did it very quickly
i don't know if that's the best way to when it isn't is it when it is too expensive to quickly re arrange it and say okay
oh right
this is it but we had to do it huh because we have to have a design and that is within the budget
well
and we evaluated
maybe we should re evaluate uh the product but we did that before and we also evaluated the project
and i think uh everybody's uh very happy
at least i am with the results so uh celebration well
yeah
yeah
for the three of you because uh i have to write the final report now
champagne
yeah
but uh well thank you very much for your co operation and i had a very nice day so far
yeah sure
no prob
oh thank you
mm-hmm
okay
do we get another email
bling
um
i think you do
you're fired
i i think we have to fill in a questionnaire again but
yeah i have t i think we also have to go to our own rooms again but um well i at least
we do
mm
but maybe you can try uh to make a screen shot of this so i can try to include it in the final report
yeah
uh th that that one
you cannot you can save it
yeah maybe
you can just yeah but it's it isn't a picture or well is it
wants to but at least this one
i know we should remove this but it won't h
you s uh file save as the j. peg j. peg
okay
and uh please put it in the project folder then huh
can you find it as a j. peg
no
no isn't possible
but you can make a screen shot i think
okay well i uh
no
no
i hereby officially close the meeting and uh i hope to see you uh soon
yeah
okay
in uh
in about five minutes
uh oh export
well i think we'll be a bit a bit longer but okay
ah
well happy celebration huh
oh thank you
images
whoo hoo
celebra or shouldn't i
let's let's have party
how big do you want the images
let's have some fun
how big
huh
yeah
uh
not too big
this one
whatever you think is good
six hundred
no i yeah
no that uh is one thousand twenty four
i think eight hundred six hundred is better
this one
yeah
yeah
if it browse
nah name
um
desktop
well it isn't on the desktop
hey
mm
i do not know
you can only save it in my documents
oh
oh my god
yeah
oh
oh alright
yeah
okay
yeah
yeah
three
ten
can we stay here
yeah
ten
yeah
uh
okay
yeah alright
why can't we stay here
alright
yeah
celebration time come on
oh
oh
peace out nigger
entree
mm uh
we're the first
mm
we're the first ones
marketing expert yes
mm
so you found your spots
yes
move to the meeting room
bling bling
yeah
okay
right
okay
uh where has my screen gone
hi
hello good day
oh yeah we have to talk in english huh
hmm
yep
yeah
my screen is gone
oh
it's called black
kick off meeting wow
i'm afraid i'm a bit slow for this stuff uh
it's uh looks uh nice
hmm
okay
i'm afraid i'm a bit too slow
i don't know how much preparation you guys did but not a lot
yeah
yeah
no it's it was uh not enough
you see this beautiful presentation
yeah
very nice
okay let's get started
yeah
uh i sort of prepared this
uh opening acquaintance tool training uh how to use the things here
mm
uh project plan discussion and yeah then the rest of the meeting
mm-hmm
um we're supposed to develop a new remote control that's both original trendy and user friendly
so hope you have good ideas
i don't
i did my best
um we're work we're working uh from top to bottom
not yet
uh functional design then we do some in individual work then we have a meeting to discuss the results etcetera etcetera
and at the end of the day we should have a prototype drawn up
uh we have available the smart board and the whiteboard
um
uh we should take some practice
i have some instructions now to do that
yeah
uh well you know how to the documents work
so
uh this for toolbar
you see it next
um
we have a pen
and we can use this pen to perform
operations
yes
so
it doesn't always work
yes
yeah
okay so you can
draw
draw
okay and in the format menu you can select colour and line width etcetera etcetera
alright
'kay
okay
uh
okay
each of you can uh take some practice and you should draw an animal
uh you should explain
uh with different colours and with different pen widths
and you should explain why you draw that particular animal
okay
so julian
don't take up too much space
um yeah
different pen widths how do you do that
uh with the format menu
oh okay
and use different colours etcetera
it's a giraffe
are you serious
and what's that supposed to be
should it be one
yeah
oh yeah
okay
oh yeah four legs
uh-huh
giraffe's yellow
uh it needs some uh some yellow uh
oh format
can you use one blank sheet per drawing
or so y you must save it at the end and then
yeah
yeah you can press the next button which is uh yeah
that's some spots
i'll show you
i in the file option menu
yeah
in file menu
okay then m make a new one
no
how much time do we have to draw anyway
yeah
'cause i can take forever on this
okay
do i have to explain uh why i chose this uh this animal
yeah
i think it's a it's a great animal
what is it
it's a it's a giraffe
a giraffe okay
yeah that's a
yeah i see a long neck but
it's more like a dinosaur
um
okay i'll will give it an uh an eye
okay
uh
that's nice of you
hey
come on
some leaf to eat
okay
yeah pretty good
uh could you press the next uh
the next
yes
okay
then uh
yeah
here you go
thanks
hmm
yeah
is this part of our a acquai or introduction to each other
yeah sorry introduction and get acquainted and
uh
alright
that's the idea so
uh
your line broke
yeah
alright
it's not that fast
yeah it's a bit slow so
yeah
yeah
i see
it misses the spot
pressure
i'm guessing a turtle
no
i'm kidding
i say good guess
uh
why a turtle
because of its shell
because it's slow
it's slow
'cause it's so 'cause it's green
you were slow too so
yeah i was a bit slow too
dude you're a good drawer
so
uh some other line uh width uh
do you have a turtle pet
no
uh okay
i dunno
does it have legs
yeah yeah yeah
yeah sure
yeah
yeah not exactly legs but
stumpy stuff
more like fins or
it's more like a tank
yeah that's fins but i don't know where
they kind of l look like mole legs
with sharp nails on
yeah
some spots
ah some eye
yeah it's l looks very friendly
yeah that's a fr friendly turtle i guess
yeah well i think it's uh fair enough
yeah okay
a little tail maybe
right
i don't know what the position is
does it have ears
uh no
no
no
no
oh okay
the little holes maybe
can you erase ears or yeah
yeah yeah yeah
there's a a gum gum to
alright
eraser
and why did you choose this animal
so
he said it was slow
i dunno
i it just came into my mind
so there's no particular reason i pen
alright
i like it
yeah
well i'm guess i'm done
okay
that's my turtle
your turn niels
alright
how to select the next or here
the next yeah
yeah
colours were under format right
here you go
makes new paper
yeah
let's see
orange
how am i gonna do this
um
mm uh
a rabbit i think
kangaroo
not quite actually
kangaroo
fox
a fox yeah
firefox
dog
no
cat
aye
it's a cat
it's a cat
mm
not quite yet through
a cat who had an accident or
why a cat
uh yeah i dunno
they're my favourite pets
you have some uh
uh i have colour already
yeah i'm not so good at drawing with this kind of st oh shit
the pen yeah
um
excuse my language
sure
i don't know how to draw its face
but you get the idea
it's a cat
yeah
it's my favourite uh pet animal 'cause they're cute they're independent and cuddly i dunno
alright
okay
that's it
or do i need to use more colours and
yeah
i think it's okay
alright
you get idea right
yeah
okay um we have a financial aspect to this project
um we can sell them at twenty five euros
uh
the aim is to reach uh uh to sell as much as fifty million euros
uh that's quite a big amount of money
and the production cost should be the half of the selling price
so we have to s
okay now it's time for some discussion
okay
uh
what uh what uh do you want to discuss
yeah
yeah
we should get started
yeah
yep
uh i'm taking notes
okay
great
um
we each have a specific task as i saw in my mail
mm-hmm
i didn't know if you received the same mail
yeah
yeah
yeah
i guess so
okay so the um uh this industrati industrial designer should produce a working design
yeah
am i correct
true
okay
uh the user interface designer should specify the technical functions
right
yep
yeah
and the marketing uh expert should come up with user requirements
yeah
uh did any of you already do some work on this part or
well i started making an overview for myself um what i had to do
'cause we have three design steps and in every step i have a s specific task to perform or whatever
mm-hmm
mm-hmm
so i had to uh i dunno make an overview for myself about what i have to do
mm-hmm
and kind of let it work in to get ideas about
mm-hmm
and do you have any ideas about the product uh so far
well how i have to fill it
well i started i started with the first phase i think was the functional
mm-hmm
and uh let's see i had to focus on the working design which you said
mm-hmm
how does the apparatus work
and well i basically had two points
uh according to the coffee uh machine example i have batteries to supply energy
yeah
yeah
and we ye use button presses to activate or deactivate certain functions on the t. v.
mm-hmm
okay
and that's basically all i have so far
yeah i got another point
it uses infrared light to communicate the signal to the t. v. apparatus or stereo
yeah
wireless uh-huh
yeah
yeah
alright
yeah
so that's very common
uh it's uh some buttons for for the on off function
you d you already told that
and for the changing up to the to all the channels and changing the volume
that are the the basic options for a remote control
yeah
yeah i kept it global 'cause that it activates or deactivates specific functions 'cause i wasn't thinking yet about that
okay yeah
i mean you wanna ch ch flip the channel but you might wanna use teletext also
yeah
yep
yeah
i dunno what the word is in english
uh
same i believe
yeah
uh and what did the marketing expert do
uh well from a marketing uh perspective um well the function des design phase uh consists out of the user requirements
mm-hmm
um what needs and desires are to be fulfilled
so there are a few means to reach that um by by doing research uh to see what existing products are there out in the market
mm-hmm
i mean what functions do they have
mm
um especially what are their shortcomings
are there any new functions uh which can be added to our product
mm-hmm
mm-hmm
um therefore we have to to do some internet search
yep
for example for um well what kind of applications do current remote controls support and what are f featur features of uh current and future televisions
yes
so we can see uh what needs to be supported
um and we can interview current users and future users
what w what would they like to see uh on a new remote control
okay
okay
um especially for future users uh i'm thinking of early adopters because they they use new technology first
mm-hmm
and they play with a lot of tools and stuff so maybe they have some good ideas to uh to add
okay
and you can get that information
i think i can get that information yeah
okay
that would be very handy
so yeah
um but have you any idea so far as what uh the user requirements are
no n not specifically
more to how to get them and
no
i got some uh requirements it has uh it has to be user friendly
no okay
yeah
yeah
of course
yeah
yeah
obviously
uh really easy to use buttons not not uh very small buttons but not the the also the big big buttons but just normal buttons
it has to be a small unit
it has to be uh yeah you can take it with you uh everywhere in in your house
so it has n has not to be l yeah gigantic uh machine
big mm-hmm
yeah
uh and a and a good uh zapping range
uh what do you mean by that
yeah
uh the distance uh from your television to your uh remote control has to be uh yeah um yeah quite a big distance
yeah
it has to be capable for zapping uh
from the other end of the room or something
yeah
yeah
okay um
well i don't think i have anything more to add at the moment
um
i think the best is to go to work
whoa
is that you or alright
yeah
okay
any more points to discuss
yeah
i think
we can go ahead with what we have
i will summarise the things we discussed and put it in the project folder
uh the use of the industrial designer can work on the working design etcetera etcetera
and it seems you get more information by email
alright
so that was it for me
alright
okay
'kay
thanks
uh
are you going to put the the notes on the
yeah in the project folder
yeah
the pro okay
okay
yeah
alright
i'm writing very fast
yeah
yeah
okay
hope it's readable
uh
yep
okay um anything more you want to add to the discussion
i guess so
well no i'm just a bit wondering what we're gonna do the next uh
yeah
do we only have to to do uh phase one the functional design uh
session
yeah
because then we have a
after that we are going to the conceptual uh
yeah
yeah
we're just working the three phases
y you do some individual work we have meeting individual work meeting
and at the end of the day we have a final meeting
and then i have to prepare uh i have to defend our design so make it good
yeah okay
okay
we'll do our best
okay
i depend on you
better make it
i am gonna work on the conceptual design already 'cause yeah it's fairly important to know what kind of components we want to put in
yeah
if you can mix it it's okay
mm-hmm
yeah
do we i mean is it gonna be a multimedia control centre
do we want to be able to use the video recorder with it
yeah
yeah
that is my question also because like new new functions
well i think that is the user
requirements
requirements part
yeah
as to what they want
yeah
true
uh do they want all those functions on that small
yeah
but but we need good communication about this stuff 'cause i have to f put the components into the design
unit
yeah
yeah
mm-hmm
i would first m
so if i don't know what components to put in it's kind of hard
yeah well i i was
yeah i understand
yeah
i i think we have first to start with the basic functions and we can uh expand them
yeah well like l li like some like some some remotes who are out there
you can always add a few
yeah
which i know there's one button which is very easy to switch between devices
yeah
so you can switch to your video and then the same buttons control your video
hmm the c. d. player
yeah
yeah
and another function i'll think of switch to your media centre because that's getting very popular
yeah so
and then use your windows media centre under your t. v. with the same remote control
yeah
so with the switch one single switch
okay
yeah i i know what you mean but you'll ne need several other buttons for a video player
okay
s
you need a play and a forw fast forward and a stop function
mm-hmm
yeah records and stuff like that
and you you don't need that for a t. v.
okay
no
and and for a t uh teletext you need additional buttons as well so i kind of need to know what we uh need
you need additional yeah
yeah
yeah
yeah
uh
yeah
whatever i'll just put my ideas in uh
yeah
in here and then we can discuss it with the next uh
in the project uh
yeah
yeah
we could just start with the assumption that's only for t. v. and video
meeting
and um reserve the possibility to add other features
okay
so we have a basic starting point and you can always extend that so make sure it's extendible
okay
yeah it it has yeah it has to be user friendly
yeah
alright
yeah
so it's hasn't it's yeah
th the least amount of functions possible so it's easier to get to know how it works etcetera
yeah
okay
yeah
yeah
i understand
yeah
yeah
yeah
okay and uh i'll see you again uh when the computer tells us to
alright
yes
yeah
yeah you're di dismissed
can we leave now or
half an hour
thanks
you're fired
not yet
no
mm
alright
okay
alright let's move on
let's see what we got to do
yeah
see you later
yeah see you later
okay
yeah
good luck
yeah
thank you
well good luck
what the
hello
'kay
you all saw the newsflash
it's
or you got the same message
yeah i i just saw it one minute ago
yeah sorry
i don't know
when i uh
i didn't see it yet i think
yeah
newsflash
d did i miss something
yeah
yeah i received an email so i thought i i can't mail you so i thought i'd just drop it in the folder but
yeah pretty much
hey what's wrong with my computer
okay
is it unlocked
mm
no
yeah that's my presentation
woah
i uh kind of opened it
huh
mm
mm
what the
oh right
uh
i think you have to uh change your desktop uh
okay
size
ooh
'kay
everybody ready
not really
well
sorry
computer is uh not functioning
no no no
yes yes yes
alright
okay
okay
where do i find this
i'm not so g display huh
uh display
and then uh settings
appearance
huh
mm i'm not sure i
you read the newsflash
no
'kay
no what was it about
hmm
can we get started or is there some pressing issue
yeah my computer is not functioning properly
oh no pressing
did you plug in the power cable when you come back
yeah yeah
no but my screen is reduced in size
yeah
what
that's difficult
yeah
yeah
feedback
hmm
okay
okay
alt delete
yeah
format
format save
so it doesn't draw the attention away
this is dreadful
yeah
i made uh uh my own map
no not this but the task
oh yeah sure
it's a
you have playstation also
yeah
yeah
no that's okay
no i just flapped it closed it took it here and then this happened
ah
uh where was it
in settings
okay
alright
thank you
huh
do you guys like your tasks
yeah
yeah
i spent a lot of time thinking about what i was gonna do and then a couple of minutes before this i get my function you know the information that i need
yeah wa wa you actually
yeah
yeah
so frustrating
but it it's not clear what you have to to to type uh type in your presentation
so
yeah
i i had a whole idea and then just was typing it and then oh
yeah
i have to do that so switch
yeah exactly
this presentation is mainly based on my own ideas 'cause i hadn't time to intergrate tha the information yet so
mm
yeah
really annoying
okay
so there we are again
by your humble p. m.
yeah
okay this is the agenda
um we have three presentations i heard
really
yeah really
so who wants to start
yeah that's fine
yeah
we have to start it right away
yeah
functional
uh this is you
yeah functional requirements
'kay
alright
i'm gonna talk about functional requirements
um
well uh some research has be done uh has been done
uh observing of one hundred uh subjects in the usability lab using a remote control
uh and they also filled in a questionnaire
the findings were um well you can see them for yourself
they disliked the look and feel of current remotes controls
users think they're ugly
um they do not match the the operating behaviour of the users
so they they d they don't match what they want to have on it
um they are often lost somewhere in the room
um it takes too much time to learn how to use a new remote control
and they're bad for r. s. i.
i don't know uh how a user can reach that but okay
um there is also uh was also some research on uh the most relevant and and and irrelevant uh f functions
ts
uh most irrelevant and less used were audio settings mono stereo uh pitch bass
um screen settings for brightness and colour and stuff like that
um but they are used
i mean the
so they do need to be in the
yeah they do need to be on the on the remote control
yeah
i mean if you can't control the the sound settings i mean if you dislike a very uh loud bass or something you you need to change that
alright
so um yeah we have to
often
by the way my t. v. doesn't have an equ equaliser but okay
we c we c
yeah i mean w we can't my my t. v. has but we we can leave them uh away
next generation does
no
alright
uh most relevant uh most used functions uh they speak for themselves i guess
uh power button uh channel volume selection
uh teletext but we can skip that because i saw the newsflash
and teletext is so outdated that it it's i should not be used uh any more in the future
n not used anymore
so forget this one
okay
uh channel settings so for programming uh your channels in in the right order
by the way where did you guys get that newsflash from
yeah
yeah
i didn't get anything
yeah on on the project uh
i was wondering uh
yeah
not by mail
i receiv the mail but you don't
so
no so it's a text file n in the project folder
but you you've got more information than uh
so teletext can be skipped
that's in the presentation so
alright
um there was some research on new features in a remote control
uh about an l. c. d. screen uh and speech recognition
well we got an update for the for the audience
or the the the targeted group
so it's above forty i guess
uh below i believe
the new product
or below because that's pretty relevant
yeah below forty
mm-hmm
i thought i read a
our current customers are in the age group forty plus
yeah
and the new product should reach new markets which is the customers below forty
below
okay well that's that's in the newsfla okay that's a good to know
but where did you get uh that information
that's in a newsflash
okay
um because you see see a clear distinction between the age groups concerning the features
yeah
i mean uh above forty people are not so interested uh not so interested in a screen or speech recognition
uh but below that age they uh they pretty much are
so i think we can build that in
um
yeah well we can skip this part as well because i thought i read above forty so we could skip the features
but we just have to build them in because uh they find it very interesting
um well we have to keep all the classic functions but make the buttons as user friendly as possible
um and and also there's so not only the design of the bus uh buttons but o how you can push them and stuff like that
so the physical uh aspect of it
um
and i think and certainly for for the for the lower age groups uh nice design which uh does not make the remote control in your room
it's it's actually a part of your interior of of your design in your room
yeah
so it's the people can say well what's that well that's my remote control
so it's d it has to look nice and feel nice and and have all the functions that uh
yeah
but it also needs to have corporate identity
yeah so the the logo has to be uh present yeah and the colours as well
present and the colours
so we can't change much of that
do we have uh yeah
yeah so but i i don't think that's that's a problem because the thing has to have a colour anyway
mm-hmm
mm-hmm
and most of the times there is a brand present on it
yeah
so i think that's not gonna gonna affect it very uh very much
yeah
okay
well that are the the consequences uh on a marketing uh part
alright
yes
'kay
okay
it's open already so you can use to
mm
find yours
it's
f. five
f. five
okay
go jurgen
oh
what is this
oh no
how do i uh
you pressed alt f. four
no no no
i pressed the mouse button
oh great
it's th that's the self destruct button
yeah
yeah
uh maybe you can do it from your computer so talk us through it
okay
okay
yeah
um if you all go stand around uh
just yeah
yeah
computer
sure
alright
um
that's nice
no
f. five
yeah
yeah
okay
alright
i uh had uh two examples
mm-hmm
um this one is the the yeah the advanced one with a lot of options and functions and buttons
mm-hmm
this the easy one i think we have to to combine them
yeah
yeah
mm-hmm
and uh yeah merge the best functions of all examples
mm-hmm
yeah
um but yeah the the age is uh under forty
the mm yeah
yeah and and and marketing research stated that that that kind of users are not afraid of of a lot of functions
so we
okay so so we have the option for more functions
so not not too much but yeah
um yeah
and we do have to integrate the screen and the the speech alright
and the speech recognition yeah
yeah
yeah
uh yeah this this one we can remove for kids
it's just only for adults so uh we can uh use some advanced options
yeah from age of sixteen so yeah
but
yeah but i prefer we we uh use the the basic options uh yeah
we have to to make them very easy so for just uh zapping around the channels you can just push one button
mm
mm-hmm
mm-hmm
but if you want to to use your your video recorder or something else you should use use an uh an advanced option
yeah but uh the the newsflash also stated that it should control only one device only your television
okay one device
yeah
okay
so n it's very easy
so w
i didn't see
okay and i also uh yeah
now yeah it's okay
so there are not extra options in this case but uh
okay
w yeah
we have to make it fashionable
yeah
like you uh said uh before
yeah
uh yeah the basic functions
um yeah only use a extra function if they are really needed
yeah so maybe you can hide them or something
yeah
yeah
yeah well what what we can do with the screen is is all the the configuration options you can put that in the screen
yeah you make a screen menu or something
and the and the yeah screen menu to to to uh to do that and then the basic function just on the device itself
yeah
yeah
so it looks very simple and all the advanced features are hidden in the screen uh with a clear menu
mm-hmm
yeah and the other oth other uh functionality is the screen
yeah
what does the screen do
did i uh did i break it
uh
alright
what are wh
yeah
it's low power
what
so what does the screen do
they said they needed it but what does it do
what do they want with the screen
for for the advanced functions i think
yeah that's what we make it up
yeah well it yeah it didn't it didn't say what they want to do with the screen
so but what did the marketing
no
well i my guess is it's it's pretty handy for advanced uh advanced functions
yeah okay it's handy
with no predefined uh
like searching for channels and
yeah searching for channels programming them
ah look
we have your uh oh never mind
yeah
we're back online
okay
that's uh i'm al i'm almost finished so
um the we have to to to watch out for the i if we make it f very fashionable it it the functional functionality will go down
okay
so we have to make uh a compromise between functionality and fashional fashionable yeah content and form
mm-hmm
content and form
yeah
yeah
now that that was uh was the end
that was the end
yeah
okay
yes
okay
well my presentation is a bit uh sucky
well you can improvise right
uh which one is it
technical functions
yeah a little bit
uh no
this one
no no
functional requirements
yeah i think that would be it then
no
so we we can go for
i have no idea
you didn't put it in
or
that w
it's not really english
let me check
i know
uh kick off
oh working design i got it
yeah
so we can go for the look and feel of the the left example and then a screen on top of it
here you go
alright how do i uh skip pages
just uh press uh yeah
the keys yeah
yeah
yeah
alright
um yeah well i was working on this before i got my information
so i was just working off the top of my head and using my colin common knowledge about uh remote controls
mm-hmm
and well the info on the website which came too late
mm-hmm
um so i didn't really know what kind of functions we had to put into it yet
so uh uh this is basically an overview of what we discussed in our last uh meeting
mm-hmm
those were my uh starting points
mm-hmm
uh i was working on a s yeah on a schedule and i was supposed to do it like this
but um yeah then uh the information came and it was kind of exact with all the steps in the remote control that i had to follow
so i was trying to organise them for myself
mm
and then make the the design a the actual design but i never came around to do that
design
design yeah
yeah
so i'm not really sure what i'm supposed to say about it
okay
i mean everything speaks for itself i guess
mean you press a button um the it tru goes it sends a signal to a chip which uh translates it into infrared signal of certin spatial frequencies
mm-hmm
yeah frequency
mm-hmm
yeah
and uh or temporal fr frequencies actually
and then uh through a uh transformer
it the signal gets boosted and then sent to the to the receiver on the t. v. and the t. v. will translate it into a function
yeah decoder
um
yeah well this was
actually all i got around to do
blank
yeah
yeah
yeah okay
i mean i dunno if i'm too slow for this stuff but uh
work harder
okay shou should we make a list of the of all the functions we want uh
yeah
whatever
yeah
uh
yeah we want to incorporate in uh into it
yeah
'kay
um for those that didn't see yet um the basic new requirements of the management were no teletext only for t. v.
uh it should be designed for a use g uh group below forty
but i don't think it's w wrong if we can uh target the current customer group as well
mm
and uh the corporate identity should be clear in the design of the remote control
and we have to decide on the functions and on the let's see what was it uh the target group
we have to make be clear what that is
group of users or because it says below forty i mean
yeah users
yeah so i think it's easy but
i guess that's that's the tar yeah uh or male and female
but uh it's it's also for children or just uh
uh six the marketing research started on s on the age of sixteen
yeah it's below forty so we can decide where to
okay
sixteen to twenty five twenty five to thirty five thirty five to forty five something like that
okay
okay
so um
so below forty is okay
but we need an lower level which to s uh focus
how do you mean
so is it from sixteen to forty
is it from twenty to forty
is it from thirty
uh sixteen to forty
yeah
yeah
well i i guess people of sixteen are are quite used to technology
we we have to
'kay
yeah
so they they adapt to it pretty soon i guess
and if we have a larger public we have uh yeah more options to to uh sell our product
yeah
yeah so what we might wanna do is uh yeah cust i have customised the screen functions if you know what i mean
the uh younger users are more acquainted with these kind of machines so they can use more advanced functions
mm-hmm
but maybe elderly people don't understand it so well so they need a simpler remote
design
and yeah that you can choose what the design displays or wha whatever
mm
yeah that's that's why uh i wanted to to make yeah two uh different uh yeah groups of functions
the the simple functions for for the the whole public and the the advanced options for the younger people yeah who are more yeah experienced with uh
yeah
mm-hmm
and maybe y
experienced yeah
but uh all incorporated in the screen or or just on the remote itself
na
i w i should uh put uh the the yeah the extra advanced options on the onto the onscreen display
yeah like like you have a visual of the of the brightness with with a kind of sliding bar and a bus and and stuff like that for sound and and vis and and visuals
yeah
yeah
yeah
yeah
so is you should have a menu for all the the functions you don't use regular and which are
uh you can make a if you make a drawing
yeah
yeah
aye yeah
uh
uh
shall i uh
uh black's okay
and draw it very big
oh
yeah
it's okay
yeah
no it doesn't have line control so
yeah
yeah we get the
yeah well this is basically uh it's alright the remote
the remote
the remote yeah
um well usually the power button is on top i guess
basic
is on top
which should be easy easily reached with the thumb
yeah so it should fit right in into your hand
yeah
l left top or right uh top
right
t i s should said right
right top
yeah right
right
i most people are right handed so maybe left handed special addition but okay
because yeah
okay
yeah definitely
if you put it like like here
or something
i dunno
um then you could put a screen like on a mobile phone also on top i guess
mm-hmm
yeah but if you are using the the normal functions the the basic functions you normally press them on the u yeah
do the also with the thumb
so it should be a little bit longer so that you can put your uh thumb also reach the middle
or you should screen at the bottom and then you can see it very clearly
okay so y yeah you have you have it in your hand and the screen is below and the buttons are in the middle
you you need to be able to hold it so
yeah
okay for example if you put the screen here it's more about the functions now than the than the layout
yeah
yeah okay that's true
layout
that's for the
doesn't work too well
it's uh it's bent
i can't help it
you broke it
yeah
yeah
right
man
yeah okay
okay you get it
uh for example if y if you put all the
right
you want the normal piece of paper
and you have a pen
yeah
and might be easier huh
maybe this
kind of works
yeah
like if you have
like uh ten buttons for for all the for all the channels um and here one for for
mm-hmm
uh
and the for flipping up and down
yeah yeah
and volume control
yeah that that usually uh like here here here here
yeah i
yeah
so you have up and down for the for the channels and left and right for the volume uh
yeah
and left to right
and those can also be used for the menu
yeah exactly
i thought but this is really your department that we need just the functional display and four cursors
yeah
yeah
yeah
yeah okay but this is function so if you can use them for multiple things
and you you have most of the time you have one button in the middle
and
yeah okay
it says menu
for the menu
yeah
and then if you press it you the screen gets activated and then you can use these buttons to scroll up and down and left and right to go into functon and then just mo most of the time this menu button is also like okay
mm-hmm
yeah
yeah
to to confirm a a kind of action
yeah
so you scroll into it okay
you select a function like v like uh bass
you just adjust it with these two buttons
yeah
then okay to confirm and then uh on on each on each screen there's there should be an option to go back to a to a upper level
and then finally say okay exit
mm-hmm
or or one button to exit it
yeah
uh in one time i dunno that's not really my department
and do we need a a logo on our uh remote control or
that's more your uh your department to to uh to
yeah
yeah
but it should be if the screen is here then the logo should be like on on top yeah
on the left uh top yeah
i mean it's uh
okay
yeah but that depends on where you put the screen
but it's essential that there is a screen
yeah
yeah i mean the position of the screen is also more essential than i mean we we look where we have space left and then put the logo over there
yeah
and for the speech uh recognition part if we want to incorporate that we need a microphone
but um
yeah so it should be i mean if you have it in your hand here should be on top somewhere maybe
yeah
this would be uh
why did we wanna put the display in the bottom
i mean i
no that's not s sure so uh we need a display
that's not sure but it's
okay
yeah may maybe because you're
because yeah if you use the functions your hand will block the display
yeah okay but only for the basic functi if you're going to use the advanced option you're going to press the the menu button and then yeah
yeah i mean a screen on top looks more lo logical to me
normal for logical t
also because people use m mobile phones and they also have the screen on top
yeah
yeah
yeah they're used to it
okay the yeah
so you you just have to reach a little bit for the power button
that's possible
yeah
i mean if you grab it
on once it's on it's on
but most most of the times if a if if a t. v. 's on standby people just press a channel to put it on
you don't need the power button
yeah okay
okay we put it on top
so we put this on top and then make the corporate logo
yeah
like over here
r. r.
and j and the microphone i mean it can be very small
if you look at your mobile phones are some stripes little little holes
yeah
mm-hmm
maybe on the top or even on the side
yeah maybe on the side
i mean if the if the microphone is good
yeah but then it's possible that you cover it with your hand so
true
yeah okay
yeah
so on the on the top is better
i think that top is the best option
but if you uh if you hold the ma the remote like this if you put it on the top on the side i dunno
yeah okay
should be able to work
yeah
depends on the sensitivity of the microphone but i think that's okay
never mind
can we leave this up to you
yeah it doesn't matter that much
so but um the screen is on top
which functions did we have left
i mean this is basically numbers volume uh channel up and down
volume
up
channel up and down and the control of the advanced options
screen is over there
yeah
yeah
so maybe it we should decide what advanced options we want to put in the l. c. d. screen
if we
yeah
that's uh that's a good one
yeah so we we needed to integrate the sound and uh
and image options right
yeah
yeah so sounds
like uh bass uh so we need kind of an equaliser
sound
if you
yeah
equaliser
so if you have sound
but not too advanced
i mean most t. v. s use only treble and bass
yeah it it's just a remote control so
yeah and they're
yeah treble middl middle bass or something
they're not used often so
yeah
yeah
it's uh pretty hard to write
ah as
mm
yeah just
okay but you have sound
yeah sounds
yeah just oh y you have digital uh better write it down over there yeah
yeah
of course
so you have sound
i'm just a secretary
yeah
coffee
uh yeah sound and then within sound i guess treble and bass
yes please
treble bass
the mono stereo option
yeah
uh
and there there was something else also
also
and then pitch
pitch i believe yeah
pitch
yeah
but pitch isn't that yeah that's the the height of the tone
yeah
the fr yeah the frequency of the tones yeah
yeah okay wh why would you use that
yeah and mono stereo
yeah isn't that that depends on the on the signal of the of what program you're watching
if people like talk like uh
mm
yeah
and also the tuning part
programming part
yeah programming
uh so we have sound yeah
so channel programming
channel programming
and yeah in the functionality of the
television uh itself uh
no no of the remote uh do do we want uh the buttons to make sound when you press them
as a confirmation or whatever you know
mm
mm
i dunno
mm
i think it g it gets annoying
i mean most mobile phones used that in the beginning but
yeah
we we could make an option for it but uh you can disable s
under the a yeah advanced option menu you can put those things
yeah
but uh the the television itself has also the the options brightness and uh screen colour etcetera
yeah
so yeah
contrast yeah
yeah but people don't want to sit on their knees on their knees in front of their television with only three buttons then it's very hard to y yeah contrast and brightness
mm
no
uh so contrast
yeah
bright
yeah those are the most used i guess
uh
if you look at your monitor
and the others were in your presentation right
so i can just copy those
well yeah well i guess that these were the only ones i guess
okay
it's easy
yeah
but so we have we have t. v. options which is all this
i will look it up
yeah the button options and the l. c. d. options
the sound sound and image
and you have in that uh the indeed the remote control options
indeed
yeah
so we need two menus kind of thing
yeah you have basically a button menu which you can use directly uh according to the old principle
uh-huh
and the l. c. d. options are activated by some some software options thats communicates with the infrared uh decoder yeah
yeah with the chip and then i mean
so you
uh yeah
you have an additional processor and and software part
well yeah we have power button whether that's present
alright
compared to o
mm-hmm
channel volume selection present
uh numbers present
yeah a audio settings mono stereo pitch bass treble
l. s
yeah
screen settings brightness and colour
colour
yeah i i call it contrast
yeah con contrast is
yeah i make it c colour
yeah okay colour and brightness
yeah
um and what you say channel settings or channel programming
so you you have an option to to start scanning all the frequencies and when it encounters one well it shows on your t. v.
yeah and automatically um
mm-hmm
and then you can um
uh and then you can select uh a number in your remote on which you want to save it
yeah so i've g channel program is autoseek
yeah autoseek
uh name a channel or
well most t. v. s automatically display the name which they get through the cable
oh they get automatic names okay
yeah
so you only have to choose the position on your
it only has to match the the channel frequency on your t. v. with with the with the position on your t. v. and and so your remote
yeah
yeah but can you also say i want f uh veronica on the channel number uh five or
help
if you already programmed it
yeah
if you want to move it
yeah
yeah that should be possible too
how do you call that
yeah how do you call that
mm
wait you you should be able to to browse through a list or something which w displays all the all the values all the channels which are possible
channels
yeah
i mean like one to f thirty of or ninety or whatever
ninety nine or something
yeah
just browse through it and then um in some kind of way see if it if it if it is programmed
s swap channels
can i call it that
yeah
swap channels
swap's good option
okay
uh other functions
so you most of the time if you if you swap it
s uh let's say for example you have uh r. t. l. five on on channel five
and veronica on channel eight and you want to move veronica to channel five um most of the times you override the previous uh the previous one
mm-hmm
okay
well that's 's up to uh mister user interface designer
yeah
it's it's pretty uh yeah i mean you have to look on on the menu
okay
working design
on the t. v.
also
doch
that's you're
he only has to figure out how it has to look
and how
yeah but also which buttons you have to press to get a certain result
yeah
to use
and the working design was to specify how ph the physical interation between the components was as i believe
yeah okay
but
yeah
you did your homework
but um yeah
or or is it too hard to to ju to just do it all on your remote
okay
to programme the channels
no no
no i don't think so
no that's
it should be able to do any remote
uh
but i think the communication with the television is difficult
but that's not our part
yeah
no
we don't have to design a protocol so
no
that's true
that's true
thank god
yeah
okay
so we have a figure a figure out a way to to do that easily
i mean th the autoseek is is not a problem
i mean you uh you uh current channel and then then it just says uh on which number do you want to save this
no that's the
and you just press a number on your remote and then say confirm okay and then it's it's saved
it's easier it's it's it's harder to if you have already programmed it to to swap
yeah
so we have to think of something for that
so but
um
the user interface designer can design a menu
for all these function i put them on the
yeah k kind of structure into layers
on the uh yeah can you i make a a map with with all the yeah 'cause it's now there are lots and lots of documents
yeah
yeah i can
and
i'll just try to reorganise uh things
so
um
so you design the basic function menu for the l. c. d. screen
uh um
and and the layout of of the thing itself
i think th i think the yeah the layout of the screen and i think you can concentrate more on the button placement and the placement of the uh screen itself on the
the the layout of the remote control
isn't that more the the u uh the user interface part
no i d i think that's more in
uh all the functional uh aspects of the remote i think are in my department
maybe more on
yeah
yeah
i have to know what it has to do
so if you wanna you know the changing the channels kind of s thing is i have to integrate that in the design
okay
so he's layout and you're function
yeah
form function okay
i think that's a that's a good separation
okay
but do i have to to uh to yeah to make the the menu layout also
or
yeah
mm
are you going to do that
yeah
yeah i guess so
yeah
i i'm going to make yeah o okay
i think i that's your department yes because w he already knows what
yeah
yeah we have to kind of work together
yeah
if if i make the the the yeah the menu like
yeah
but we're not allowed
i have to state which function has to be in the menu and then you have to decide
it's in a in a way that b is user friendly
yeah
okay
y you you are going to make a list of what functions are uh are going to to be on the the screen the menu screen
yeah
yeah
and i'm going to make a a nice menu uh with with pages and yeah
yeah
yeah
i think yeah
with with some l with some layers in it
so some menus
yeah and also make clear which buttons to press to get certain result because that's always the difficulty
yeah
every device has its own
yeah
yeah
well i guess this this button the the the okay menu okay
menu okay
yeah
or you can incorporate two uh difference uh different buttons
uh like uh for your mobile phone
um so this is only for to get in the menu or to exit it
mm
and then one to confirm and one to go one step back
back
yeah
so it's like the the save button on your your mobile phone if you have a nokia or like that
or the or the no button
mm-hmm
to go one step back you it's only two extra buttons but if it if it's very clear that they are for the screen
yeah
w we
uh i think we have to to group to make two groups
um the one group for the for the display and one group for the basic functions and
yeah
yeah but they're incorporated
yeah okay but we we have a m yeah but maybe that's that's not uh yeah if you're if you're z zapping uh with your uh yeah remote control
yeah because this this is used for both
up and down is
smart
you can press the the menu button and then you are suddenly into the the yeah the display
into your screen
okay
so you l should leave the menu button out of here
you wanna separate uh
yeah
and and just put it under the screen the screen
put it on top
yeah j just just group group the yeah we make these the advanced functions and these the basic functions
mm-hmm
yeah
so we make a yeah a line between them
but we should place the screen on top right
well
f oh yeah
okay yeah we swap uh okay
but that's uh j jurgen's department
yeah
yeah
yeah
so we make it a
you just you just find out and
you just make the layout
okay
you do we do the extra two buttons or not
uh
i think you should
yeah
it's easier
if you put too many functions in one button it gets confusing
yeah okay
yeah
yeah
that's true
so we have a a menu button and a s
and to okay and back also
yeah
okay
okay and back button
yeah or confirm and back
and of course the four arrows
whatever
yeah
no
but those are still y doubly used
should we save this picture or or you know what it looks like
both the l. c. d.
yeah i'm i'm not s clear about uh the the extra two buttons
we have a menu button and
yeah
yeah
that that just to to activate the screen
that's the the one with the yeah okay
so
menu button access the menu in the l. c. d. screen
and then with these buttons woa y you navigate
you can navigate
okay
but you can also navigate the channels
and the volume
okay so that that's not uh yeah that those are
those are both both yeah
multifunctional
hey is it interesting for users if we put led lights under the buttons
so that if you uh press on the menu function that only the buttons that are used for the menu are ligh li light up
yeah
l l litten up yeah
yeah
that's very good idea
oh five minutes
n
alright
yeah that's a good idea because then it becomes clear which buttons are active now which you can use
light uh
yeah and then it's also easier to integrate several functions in one button
yeah sure
yeah
okay
yeah
um
so
anything else
those buttons are are lit up
i think not
but just one thing
should we use those two
them
or only this to to scroll
and then use the two functional buttons to confirm to go into something
i've
oh no we have to use this to adjust some some bars
volume
yeah
yeah keep it optional 'cause maybe you can you know go left to right and up and down in a in one menu
yeah
and maybe we should use this also as an okay button still
and then just only a back button
well we have those buttons
no
the pr the problem with the okay button in the middle is sorry
we use all four
yeah okay go ahead
yeah
sorry uh is uh if you're pressing up and down you can easily press the okay once you when you're not already at your choice
yeah
yeah
so maybe make one uh one okay button and and one navigation button
and one back
yeah that was already decided
yeah the with with the the channel and the volume uh yeah m a multifunctional navigation button
okay that's what we decided earlier on
yeah okay
yeah
right okay
yeah
so yeah i wanna close down
you wanna close down huh
yeah
i have to sorry
that's okay
yeah
it's not because i don't like you but yh we have lunch break and then we can work for thirty minutes
already
and i have to write very fast to make the minich min minutes
yeah
and then uh we'll see
alright
how m how long is the lunchbreak
i don't know
we have to ask
nobody told me
okay
but do we have to write uh to write down uh the our stuff now
or first lunchbreak
no i th believe there's first lunch break
because i
i've everything in my head now so
yeah
or you can just
mm
okay
yeah
yeah
'kay
yes
'kay
i think you can put uh the laptop back in the room and
this is
yeah
yeah
yes sir
time pressure
'kay
yeah it's a lot of pressure
yeah
sorry for my uh not finished presentation uh
that's okay
oh yeah
oh no no
yeah we'll kick your ass later
bring it on
no
uh
i don't know if it works but it should be saved
aye
y you saved it
does it save automatically in the project folder
or
yeah
it's uh
okay
we'll see
just put back my laptop
should be here
smart board
alright
don't know if you can use it but
okay
yeah you can open it with the picture preview or stuff like that
and uh we have to make uh some maps with uh with the all the the data we uh gathered
yeah
i try to organise it by these three
it's it's just my own map so i put everything into the
yeah yeah yeah
i don't really mind
i just put the minutes here and we'll see
but you got some extra information uh
yeah that's in the functional design uh folder
okay
yeah
yeah that's just basically what i just showed
but where do you did you get the newsflash
yeah
yeah i got it by yeah
you're the only one uh okay
internet
i'm gonna get kicked if i don't do it so
okay
alright
alright
yeah
make me proud
i'll try to
so first we have a lunchbreak now
yeah
alright
i believe so
just ask
mm-hmm
i dunno where she
hello
yes i made it
english from now on
just kidding
drawing or
yeah just testing
yeah
mm
english
so annoying
break is over
ooh it works
whoo
spicy
spicy
where are are all the other presentations
i just put it in the in the shared folder so it should be yeah i think so
the conceptual or
yeah conceptual design
ah
what or whatever does it
because i see only my own presentation yeah
no no no can you go back one
uh 'cause it has to be powerpoint pre yeah components design that's it
this
i'll just put it in there
so he's coming
i did get a bit more done than the last time 'cause i knew that i didn't have time so i just copy and paste everything into the
or not
okay
oh okay
ah i can't cut and paste it into the other folder but
ah
she
you can look at the final report 'cause i have to record everything we are deciding and such so i'm trying to write it down between everything else
move to meeting room
sometimes i have these pop ups or these sounds and there's nothing there
yeah
oh
and also with i don't know how to use powerpoint so it takes me forever to get something done with it
yeah me too
i i've got the same problem as well
yeah
yeah
yeah
here we go again
welcome
uh we have again three presentations and then we have to decide on what concepts the mobile phone has to uh f the remote control has to support
thi
so who wants go
mm-hmm
yes
who wants to start
yes
me first again or yeah
yeah sure
oh
no
doesn't matter
yeah
no problem
alright
did you open it already or no
no
ah
ah
yes
so welcome to the marketing presentation once again
um this time about trendwatching
uh well there has been inv investigation again in the in the remote control market
uh it shows a number of developments
uh i will address them uh in a moment
um fashion watch watchers uh have detected the trends for young public because that's our public
um well fruit and vegetables will be will be the most important theme for clothing uh shoes and furniture
and the feel of the material is expected to be spongey
so um the developments i will address them oh yeah well this is the fruit and vegetables looks of fresh bright colours
so to give you an idea
um well the developments
uh development one
uh well most important aspect for remote control happens to be a fancy look and feel
instead of the current uh functional look and feel
um well fancy stands for an original look and feel of the case and the interface
and the second most important aspect is that a remote control should be technological uh innovative
um well it stands for the use of technical features that do not exist in current remote controls
i think we pretty much covered that with our screen and um and speech recognition so i don't expect that to be a problem
sound
yeah yeah uh uh
and the third development um is that the remote control should be easy to use
um
well the first aspect uh was twice as important as the second which was twice as important as the third aspect
so um that kind of gets you this ratios
mm-hmm
so fancy look and feel uh is the most important uh point of attention
uh so the fruits and vegetables in combination with the spongey material
um well technolog technological innovation we've covered that pretty much i guess
um and easy to use i don't think that will be problem
so my point of attention is especially this part
that this will be a crux
yeah
so that was the marketing uh presentation
i had only one document left
and shall i go first
yeah
so i
no
i i don't mi i don't mind
that's
so kind of this
yeah yeah sure
yeah
do you want to go first
okay
so a k a small example
no
yeah
kind of this this look
uh nothing about the buttons but just sponge kind of thing and and some fruit and colours i dunno
yeah
just made a quick design
cool
it's better than than my uh drawing
alright
yeah you're just the user interface hmm
alright
yeah okay but i have to design the
uh components
yeah layout
yeah
oh no
yeah okay
yeah
it's okay
you probably opened it
yeah true
um
f. five
f. five
alright
so i'm dealing with the components design
um let's see
i uh used some design examples we had uh from similar products
and i used uh possibilities from our manufacturing department about current components which will have to be implemented in the design
that's why i had to wanted to go first
well they gave me um an idea about what people want
we're f mainly focusing on this group but i want to make the distinction clear
uh i could not drag the pictures into the the slides so s so i don't have examples of how it looks like
but it comes down to what you uh what you think we should do with the spongey and the fruity looking uh type
if you the young dynamic people want soft primary colours uh which looks like fruits you know
you can and shapes that are curved and not uh solid straight lines anymore
so this basically um yeah goes on to what you were mentioning earlier
there is a lot of um factors involved in choosing the components
there's a lot of options that we have to discuss
uh for example the energy source
we have four types
the basic battery
uh we have a hand dynamo which we yeah we dutch refer to it as the kneipgatt
yeah
uh the kinetic provision of energy which means if you move the thing if you shake it
which will be fun for toddlers right if they wanna use the
yeah
and uh of course solar cells
but i dunno how we would use that into the design of the actual product
wi an indoors
so uh my yeah also also in you know countries where there's n isn't much light like in scandinavia
oh
yeah okay
calculator's can do it
they wouldn't be y able to use it half of the year you know
yeah
yeah
so that's not cool either
mm-hmm
so um for the uh a case there's uh the traditional uncurved flat hard case
single curved which means that it has uh curves in one dimension
or the double curved
um i wasn't able to finish my uh personal preferences sheet
but well you know that we will have to go for the double curved 'cause it's daring and different from what we have now
yeah
uh the case materials
well we have all kinds of hard uh materials like the the hard plastic the wood and the titanium
i would definitely go for rubber 'cause it fits most in what people wanna see nowadays
yeah
um poo this is a lot of text
i wasn't able to organise this yet
we have yeah several uh interface designs
uh we can use a scroll buttons for the menus
but we already kind of decided to go for the f for the pushbuttons for the the arrow buttons
yeah
pushbuttons
yeah
so that's not really interesting
yeah
electronics
yeah maybe we wanna decide on what electronics to use the advanced chip i think
is easiest to implement uh for the production 'cause they they can print it better
um
yeah
i think this is about it
yeah i was working on some per personal preferences
i first uh chose for the battery 'cause yeah i'm traditional and that's the most obvious easiest choice to go to
but i really think that we should maybe uh think about the kinetic energy where you have to move the thing to be able to use it
yeah
yeah
yeah
as an optional uh feature
yeah
or combine uh both with a with one uh
i guess we can only choose one
uh i think you can only fit one uh source of energy on the
yeah maybe we
okay
i can imagine that the kinetic uh type energy source would be more expensive to make
but it is more longlasting that the people don't have to ever buy batteries again
yeah
yeah i didn't receive any info uh
and it's more fun
and it's also more fun yeah
i always chuck my uh remote control around so
yeah just playing with it and especially when the material's rubber
yeah
it can be done i mean you can't harm it so it's a perfect combination i guess
s yeah it's safe
and throw it
yeah y exactly
you don't have to be scared about bouncing it off the g floor and breaking it or whatever
yeah
okay
so that's the end of it
yeah
so
uh go ahead
'kay next
so double curved is like this this this or
no it means curved in two dimensions
so uh w single curved
uh let's say would be a b square box but then with curves on one dimension
mm
yeah
and double curved would means that it would have curves curves in every direction
also in in height
uh
yeah okay
like three d.
okay
yeah
can we uh
one one uh very important thing i was uh yeah thinking about is the speech uh option
yeah
we were going to use that
yeah
yeah
so um
yeah um yeah that's one thing uh which i'm not sure uh of how to implement it uh into the remote control
design
well the visual representation is not there with speech but you can
no okay but it has to be combined with with the menu uh for functions and
yeah
so okay
just yeah
i think you can just uh match the speech commands with the functions that are already present
yeah
okay
so i don't think you have to design anything else for that
yeah with the programme
but do uh j do we uh do the speech just for the basic options for the simple buttons
both
for for everything also for the advanced options
yeah
okay
uh we have this very uh basic uh trendy design
everybody says it so that's what's uh yeah um
yeah in the in the last uh meeting we uh we were yeah putting the the simple and the advanced options separated
that's
yeah obvious
um yeah
pressing the the menu option uh will disable uh all other options on your uh remote control
and only the the l. c. d. panel will uh light up and then you can only uh change the yeah the options
and and the and the buttons that you need to control it i guess
yeah
yeah
um yeah design has to be very attractive but that's your your op your yeah
you have to uh delete this but this is the the the simple uh layout
yeah
uh display on the upper side with the the menu button and maybe a some sort of cancel button or save button
that would be the back
i'm
the back
yeah
back and okay
back and okay
back and okay yeah
uh
you did read the minutes i wrote
what
you did read the minutes i wrote
a little bit i think but not not everything w
i
oh okay 'cause i pretty much summed up all the buttons there were
okay
so
oh i uh didn't read that
i hate doing work for nothing
but
but this is the the basic uh design uh for the for the m yeah for the buttons
um
i wanted to to categorise everything
uh with a speech display uh yeah sound everything you you noted in your uh minutes
um every pushbutton has uh has its own uh led light
so you can uh yeah change uh m make it more trendy for for younger people
mm-hmm
and uh if there are older people they wanted more uh yeah more uh luxurous so that's an a also an option
um that was it
that was it
yeah
okay
uh
again
ugh
okay so what we have to decide is what kind of components do we use
uh energy source chip type case type
and user interface
but i didn't see a clear distinction between these so i think what we have is okay
so we only we already decided that kinetic would be the choice for energy
no
uh the case would be doubly curved
rubber material
so
and rubber
rubber material
rubber material
and that's the only thing we have left
yeah we need the the chip on print to be able to support the the screen and uh and f audio function
oh okay
no it's easy
so that's uh is that is that the advanced chip
yeah
advanced chip
yeah
wow
otherwise you would have a simple chip just for pressing buttons
okay
yeah
but we need more
alright
kinetic
i'm just thinking this is not my department but i i'm not sure what this is gonna cost to be able to m
too
double curved
uh i didn't get any info on this
so
so 'cause we need to sell it for twenty five euro a piece
yeah
yeah
that's gonna be difficult huh
the cost of making it should be twelve and a half
i have total here
yeah
yeah yeah yeah
yeah i don't know
i didn't get any information about that so
we're going to produce it in uh china so it's no problem
yeah
child labour man we love it
yeah so it's cheap
who doesn't
uh let's see
is there a new thing
um well the interface type supplements
yeah the interface maybe can
uh it's it's quite difficult because we we haven't got all the options uh yeah
ooh
no
uh do you have a picture of doubly curved case
and could you put that in the group folder
um let me see
of the project folder
wait a sec
if you go to your homepage or something you should
yeah i'm going there now
get your own information
inspiration
i got my fresh and fyoo fruity uh picture uh also uh over there so
ah you didn't draw it yourself
well
no
ah
too less time
um yeah maybe it's
yeah also the menu
yeah that that w
yeah
this is the the menu i was uh looking uh at
yeah
yeah i was thinking of that also with with a with a uh arrow
maybe it's easier
yeah
arrow
arrow yeah
so that indicates that there's an menu under that menu
yeah
yeah
yeah perfect
so
yeah
maybe it's easier if you guys come over here
's the target group
s yeah
s see this is the the the standard traditional type where the form uh yeah serves the function you know
oh yeah
yeah sure
it's like really basic
but this m is more appealing to old people and we don't want that
yeah
yeah
this is what we're looking for
and th that means curved in both dire dire uh dimensions
oh okay
not only like this but it has to be exactly
i see
yeah also like this
so you can hold it
it has to be kind of instead of the playstation the module
it has to be like the the game cube you know where your thumbs would be laying in the instrument and it has to be nice to hold
yeah
but it has also to it it has also to be uh luxurous uh for for yeah rich people
and
th this looks a little bit like like for only for children
it ha
the children's story
yeah i've got it
yeah but that's that's the the problem uh yeah the dilemma actually
so
distinction
yeah
'cause we wanna appeal to the to the young public with fancy with flashy colours and with a lot of shape
and
yeah and the and the rubber it it will look cheap always you know with the
yeah
the colour
yeah
okay but the the colours you you can make it uh make the colours with leds uh beneath the the buttons
if you press a button and you can disable the the colour leds for for people that don't like it
mm-hmm
mm
there is mobile phones in which you can change the colour also of the lights
yeah
maybe we should consider this function
mm-hmm
to customise it and so i mean kids can make it look more flashy with different kinds of colours and people who want something you know different
yeah
different
or more uh design they can go for one colour like uh for example this uh photo th camera
mm-hmm
camera
yeah
cool
s underwater uh yeah
yeah submarine
personally i think it's really ugly
well
yeah
just give me the thing that it's inside there maybe i'm too old for this stuff
yeah
very cheap uh cheap look
yeah but this this the is for the
yeah
yeah
okay
so those i think are all my oh
uh
ah yeah bright colours
yeah
also a kind of rubber uh
and this is this is with the curved that i mean
yeah
that's singly curved
yeah
okay
yeah
that should be nice
well we could make a compromise between that
but i don't know if it's worth the effort
a compromise between what
uh instead of doubly curved we take a single curved
so to appeal a little more to the all the public
so s
this this would be uh single curved uh
mm-hmm
yeah there's only in in this dimension
yeah
like this
yeah
so curvy or not
also
yeah so we keep it singly c single curved then
yeah
exactly
exactly
yeah that would be an option
i don't know what you think
yeah
i think the i mean our aim is to make something different right
to make something new
yeah
mm-hmm
i would go for the double curved
okay
and i i'm i'm thinking uh you know uh a drawing palette where you have the shape for your thumb
yeah i'd agree
mm-hmm
so it kind of holds nicely something like that
yeah but if you if you make it more curved we we can make more and more options for buttons
yeah
well this is really your decision but
if you have uh it have it in your hand
you you you are not only um yeah you don't need one dimension but you can use other dimensions for pressing the the buttons
yeah
as well
you can make a trigger button or something like that
yeah
something to shoot at your television
yeah or that that is the confirmation button or something that you scroll with your thumb with the arrows and then confirm
mm-hmm
yeah
that's yeah
mm-hmm
that would be a nice way to use it but i mean yeah i'm thinking big already
and we need something that well that that you can able to use in one hand i think
different
stands out
or
oh yeah a one hand uh solution
yeah
so from top view it looks kinda like this
but from the side you you can have it also in a kind of shape
maybe because the the screen is on top you can have
can turn it maybe
to switch from buttons to interface hmm
if you turn it a little
maybe you can c have this kind of shape
a little upwards
so that the screen is more
oh yeah
least you can easily see it
towards yourself so you can easily see your screen
how about
well well you have it in your hand so it's a kind of an angle from your eyes to the screen
so then you have double double curved in some way
so this this is so the screen is positioned over here
mm-hmm
oh
something like that
and the buttons are more well it's very thick now but
yeah i understand what you mean
that's uh that's
how about we do a uh a pop up screen like the laptop
if you can uh flip
so that the only the simple functions will be visible at first
yeah
that that you can press it and then it comes up
and then if you want
or
uh so you have a the the side view
yeah
something like that
but then the side view can be straight
if you have a pop up screen
but i dunno if that's too expensive
so and you want to be able to
i mean maybe it's too much
yeah
make this
no uh like i would draw it like this
let's say this is the side view
that you have a a screen that will come up here and can go down that way
if you know what i mean
okay
so that it would come up like that
yeah
okay so the buttons are on top here and you flip it over that way
yeah or preferably even keep the simple buttons here and then under the screen even you could put more more advanced buttons
yeah
oh the advanced buttons
oh yeah
yeah yeah yeah yeah
right
right
that's the the more advanced options were uh for the for the menu
yeah that's good idea
yeah
yeah
yeah
but you you want okay
f for the l. c. d. menu right
yeah
you just want to hide them all
so w w
the oh
yeah
no not all because you need most of them the arrow buttons
but you can hide the okay and the back uh button
yeah yeah yeah
and the menu button also because when you flip it open and you can maybe even drop the menu button because maybe if you flip it open it will auto activate amauto uh uh automatically
yeah
oh
activate and th the yeah
so okay b but you have t you need some button to flip this open
why
you could just make it mechanical
true
true
but you can make a yeah you can make a trigger here
you know a simple uh with a
yeah
yeah and it says menu and it flips open and then you have the buttons to control it in combination with your
that's but it's it's not
yeah
it's not very uh very strong uh yeah if you drop it one time
exactly
true
it uh c it can go open
well yeah the the idea of it was is that because you close it you cover the l. c. d. screen and it won't be vulnerable to scratches or whatever
if you cover it with rubber
an adv an adv and it will be covered in some kind of uh thin rubber layer or something like that
okay
mm
and
exactly
yeah
so it can bounce
exactly
we just have to make sure that the closing mechanism won't break
yeah uh
it's very no it's very strong
th it's very solid yeah
yeah okay so that that may work
yeah
that actually will offer some extra protection for the
okay but then we still have the the the thing of the the the shape
yeah
yeah
yeah i was thinking if if you have your hand it this is your th
what kind of
harder
yeah the lower part doesn't work i guess so maybe you should try it over there
okay
if this is your thumb and this is your hand like that
with your uh wrist
that you that it would be kind of shape like this you know
so it's easier to hold in your hand to y f
but when you are left handed that's that's a problem
yeah
uh yeah
yeah of course
yeah then w then you would have to to make it like this
maybe can design two versions
yeah
but that's that's very expensive uh
like like you drew here
yeah
and maybe th then make this thicker also than the centre
give it i would give it a female shape but uh yeah
mm-hmm
and ergonomical shape
yeah
anyway
yeah
yeah
the female shape yeah
with two uh
obviously
yeah
we we could make some some rubber uh some rubber uh yeah mouse with which you can change uh and so if you
make it more appealing to guys
i mean
oh yeah
some uh k esk uh yeah
yeah
yeah but but that's optional for later i guess
i mean we have to make
okay
yeah
yeah but we have hardware inside which is so it has to have some sort of basic shape
some yeah
yeah we we better so choose one
yeah yeah
and also the screen you cannot mould it
you know kind of thing
no no no no
yeah so okay we should better choose one sh one shape
okay
yeah
but that's the kind of the idea so it lays good in the hand and then on on the side with with your thumb
and then you can
you can place the screen here which can come
you you can you can use yeah you can use the button option
yeah
so the keywords are primary co colours spongey
and but then i w i would
spongey
i would do the arrows here kind of thing
spongey can be reached by means of
those buttons
and the simple buttons here so that
yeah
yeah
yeah
and and the and the control thngs in the middle
the the the arrows
i uh y eah that's what i mean
no the arrow's over here
the arrows over here and here the s simple uh
yeah
yeah and then numbers
yeah
buttons
okay
yeah
alright
i think that uh it's a nice design
uh pretty nice design
yeah
it's cool
yeah it looks uh pretty fancy
yeah
or do we wanna make its shape look like a banana or something
i dunno
yeah that's
uh bananas wierd shape and other fruits also so it's better to have um some sort of basic print and then a fruit print in some primary uh colours
yeah
yeah we could make
i don't know what what colours should the basic print be like
like some soft green or something
orange or something
or and then
or blue
dark blue or
oh yeah yeah dark blue and then and then very bright uh a yellow banana an orange
we should use
yeah
uh a green apple stuff like that with very uh bright tones i guess
mm
yeah w we need very primary colours like bright red bright yellow
so you have something like
yeah
yeah
yeah but the primary colours w we can uh create with the with the leds on the on the remote control
yeah
yeah okay yeah
if you we uh yeah
if you make it uh just a yeah bl give it a blue colour then it's just a neutral colour
also for the for the more uh yeah for the people
mm
huh cool
that doesn't really work
to draw i guess
no it's
oh
what's this
yeah it's text
right
n no you have to exit
hm
you could also make line with uh yeah
so that's
yeah
two hours further
thickness
oh
so that's blue
oh
wh why not go for the twenty
mm
yeah
yeah
mm
that's what i call painting
y
so that's that's a dark blue basic colour i guess
yeah
yeah and then on top of that
it's pretty nice
and then uh
oh
some yellow
yeah with some some yellow banana
banana colour
like
and how about some uh some flashing standby lights
like you have on the samsung well i don't like to call brands phones
the you know that 'cause i remember from one of our first meetings that uh people lose their uh remote controls often
yeah
so it not not only in in the colours of the leds that we want something to keep it visible at all times or
how do you mean
um
yeah if you if flashing colour so you can't lose it basically
some some
yeah
yeah
exactly
well i think it's a bit too much but
maybe a
yeah
yeah an orange
well alright well this is more like purple i guess but it's should be more real dark blue
yeah
yeah
so the contrast with the with the fruit objects is uh pretty high
yeah
yeah
so uh yeah
that would be a nice uh nice device i guess
and which which colour should uh should i give the the display
uh
or
who
i mean the the colour of the background of the display
yeah
yeah
ah well i don't guess it s has to be a sixty uh sixty six five thousand uh colour so yeah too expensive
and then you can use yellow or semething
why not
aye
so just just a a blue blue backlight or something like that
yeah
mm
yeah
green is too old fashioned
but blue blue's okay
as long as you loo use uh high contrast between the the background and the foreground colour
j
yeah maybe a maybe a white a white backlight
so that people with uh with
like this
white backlight and dark
dark uh letters yeah
yeah
whatever which is visible
yeah
i know you sh you should test it under uh under a light conditions
i mean it's hard to tell uh i dunno
yeah
and also for people who are a bit colourblind
colourblind yeah
yeah
true
no so that's mostly red and green i believe
which which uh colour should the buttons be
that's adjustable
woah
why adjustable
all all buttons
yeah
or not
okay
no uh
that's how we are going to make it uh more trendy
or is it uh too expensive
but maybe i mean they have to they have to have some colour right
it's difficult
and if the background is very dark blue
blue
maybe green
but don't we wanna make the background the the bright colo colours
so th the total of the thing is very bright
yeah you can
like the pictures i showed you guys
those things were all like like bright red bright red flashy
yeah
mm-hmm flashy
so more like
mm bzz
doesn't work very well
uh
more like this colour
yeah something like that something that stands out more
and then then yellow and orange and red objects on it or something
mm
yeah
but then then again which colour should the buttons be
the the press buttons
should they be white or black or
red maybe
and it it looks quite cheap that colour i think
uh
black
it's it's not
the green
yeah
yeah but it's pretty fresh on the other side
why
i dunno
yeah
so
it's actually a pretty trendy colour at the moment
it's it's trendy okay
yeah
but
my couch is in that colour
mm
ooh
yeah
well it works pretty well
yeah
and then time was up
uh not yet
uh
do you get a pop up if we
yeah within five minutes yeah
that you have five minutes left or
alright
y left yeah left and then uh i have to kick you out
so something like this
yeah
that should be pretty nice colour
but maybe the buttons all buttons in red is maybe a bad contrast for colourblind people
yeah yeah
no that's actu
because the of the green
but the but the buttons have their own leds or not
yeah
they have leds but they have a colour
red and green are actually the b the easiest to discriminate
even for colourblind
yeah
they will see one of each as grey
yeah
but if you use uh green on blue those kind of colours will look the same
okay
okay
i think
so red buttons are okay
i think so
okay
that that's a default uh setting
you can make them red
the the red buttons
yeah
but i think you need to keep in mind that the leds are just extra light
how do you mean
yeah
uh they they don't determine the colour that much i think
okay
yeah i i was think about a red uh red leds and blue leds and
'cause you have to print on them you have a background
no that's that's too busy i guess
yeah
each number is transparent
yeah
uh partly but you have to print on the number
or the the sign
okay
so you can't
change the colour so
you better bet better better keep the led and the button itself in the same colour i guess
okay
yeah
so just an extra
bit of light
you can what we should do i think is is make kind of a see through plastic button with uh one coloured led behind it
bit of light and attention
bit of feedback
yeah
yeah
yeah
yeah
so that the whole button will shine
mm-hmm
as the colour the
and if you think about easy to use buttons we have to
well we have to make it the shape so that it's easy to hold f for both hands
but also that you can reach the buttons with your thumb if you hold the machine
mm-hmm
yeah
okay with
uh
don't mean to discourage you but uh basically
you two are going to work on the smartboard
next thirty minutes to design something so
ah right
alright
and the
you will do the evaluation
of the product
yeah
which we don't have yet
yeah uh about
so wh how should i do that
yeah i don't know
oh okay
you probably get a mail
or you you or you send it to me
or just because you are going to design it on this board right
yeah
once they are finished
yeah
yeah but maybe you can do the evaluation you don't have to evaluate yet but you can make a procedure which to follow
yeah
i don't know
i i probably get instruction on that how to do that so i make another presentation i guess
yeah
yeah
i kn i know what's gonna happen in in yeah so
about
yeah
you have the basic idea
i've a basic idea
and you two uh are going to do this
yeah
so we're gonna work here
look and feel and
on this sketchboard
yeah
yeah
good luck
alright
thanks
yeah
alright so that's uh
so i uh make new page and uh be creative
yeah
alright
but we have to do it at this moment after th this meeting
yeah you have uh thirty minutes
thirty minutes
okay
then we have to uh see something which we can uh
yeah
yeah
alright
ah so this is basically the what what we are thinking about
show to the management
yeah
shall we uh make a new uh
i would yeah
yeah l let's just uh delete all these uh or
yeah
yeah
next
yeah i just make a new one
oh next
yeah
alright
oh and save this uh board
huh
just save it
yeah i'll just i'll just keep it there
yeah okay but just press save and uh
yeah
it'll be fine
on the left
s so yeah
uh sorry
you can also include clip art
okay
yeah
current colour
so if you'll rather draw in paint or something
so um
okay
uh
shall we make some outline sketches of the basic shape first
yeah
because i i
and then after that we can make the user uh inter interface
then look
yeah 'cause i have to uh focus on the on the basic look and feel design
this
yeah
yeah
so how it's gonna look
and you have to think uh how we're gonna put the screen in it and those kind of things
uh pretty accurate
so if i'm drawing and you think okay i'm not gonna be able to put a screen in there you have to correct
oh we skip this i guess
sound button press
yep
uh do you mind if i draw in black then
yeah
you can also include it
it's not much work
for normal sketches
light only button user ca user interaction
oh no it's it's okay
so we kind of want the girlish
yeah
that's included
yeah okay
yeah
so the pl the plastic plastic buttons also help uh because of um they are only lit during interaction
figure
i'm not so good at drawing
so
excuse me
well it's a good thing that the buttons aren't um
well that they are plastic because then you can light up the light on when when they are usable
yeah
yeah
no uh uh
maybe you should draw it very large like this
yeah but this part isn't uh functioning properly
yeah
sensitive
oh right
how do we uh uh or insert text
erase
i dunno
maybe just start typing
it's a bit uh large
oh that's a bit big
yeah
you also do the other sides
not only on the front si uh the top side but also the the side view
yeah
ex exactly
l let's make first the the the all the views
uh
uh
the the front view side view and the back view
uh i thought for the side view that the w the basic section would be rather uh a bit thicker than the middle
jesus
what do i write down
yeah
why can't i work here
this is much easier
much easier yeah
where you're holding it with your 'cause your fingers have to fit underneath and
yeah
yeah
the middle has to be very small so you can have it in your hand
mm
i don't see a sign that the meeting is over yet but
exactly but the uh but the upper side has to be a bit more like that i think
no so i just work here a few minutes
yeah
yeah the display we yeah we can put a display
uh don't you think
so the display we will put in here the basic uh functions in here where it's most reachable
yeah
the
the the arrow functions
the th
exactly
yeah
yeah
oh
this is hard
what do don't have to draw it exactly do we
no it's it's uh it's okay
wait
let me try it one more time
maybe i've uh it's easier if i draw it in once
okay of course it will become way more ugly
you can make it m larger
maybe it's easier to to draw uh
yeah
this'll take forever
it's fun to work with this pen
um so larger
oh
yeah that's that's the basic idea
wrong one
and yeah
yeah
so side
five minutes left before the meeting ends
'kay
um other views
alright
yeah only if you are going to put buttons on the side of the unit
uh
yeah
that's the question
let's fill i fill in the buttons later
but we we
yeah
so this is gonna be from the
i is it if if this is from the side woah
uh from yeah yeah
from the
steady
sorry
because there the screen goes up like that right
yeah
so then it's like this or that's not convenient because then you have the screen like this and look like the it's better to have it somewhat like this
yeah
or does it flip all the way
yeah i'm i'm
the the idea is that it has to flip up to here
may maybe it's it's easier to to integrate the the the l. c. d. screen just into this this bubble
okay
because it do doesn't have to flip then
because we have en enough space for for making a an l. c. d
yeah
yeah yeah yeah
because here
it's better to to have this like this i guess and then flip it like this
true
but why why do we need uh the flipping uh
you can adjust the angle to which it flips
so it can also from this angle it can flip all the way up to there
okay
yeah
you can flip it up to there if you want
yeah
so w yeah
but we still keep the flipping mechanism
think so
yeah
yeah we keep the flip
keep the flip live
yeah because i think it will feel weird if you would make this smaller and this bigger or something that i dunno
yeah
uh the the shape is okay but yeah
i don't see the the yeah why why we should use the the flipping uh mechanism
i thought it would be cool
yeah
because we
okay yeah
it's it's for for for more trendy uh
yeah but maybe yeah but maybe we we should then
because we have enough space
h here we got uh the basic functions the the arrow uh yeah button
yeah there the middle
sh sh shouldn't we integrate it
yeah and then h we sh mm
and then like i oh th doh
come on
so this is the shape
oh
it hasn't
it doesn't aim so well
okay but the screen is a bit lower because if it falls on the other side it doesn't fall on the screen
yeah then it's
so there's a layer of rubber on the side
yeah yeah yeah
definitely
so no flipping but just no
no flipping or you wanted the flipping so
no flipping
yeah i guess but uh i mean most votes count right
but if you if you
if you drop it it it just breaks
and it has to be very strong because of the
yeah kind of
throwing and the kinetics
it's shaking
yeah
oh
we better make we better make it like this
yeah true true
yeah
eventually
yeah just light on top
yeah if you if you're going for the kinetics
and it's also for the for the children it's yeah for people not sixteen years
yeah
safer
mm
uh they are responsible enough to have a mobile phone so also to to deal with their uh remote uh control
but there are more
yeah okay that the target group
yeah okay
that's true
yes
okay
yeah
well
yeah
i'm just thinking totally different designs also
i just uh ended the meeting
you two go design
okay wi
remember that the weird pocketphone thingy which looked like kind of a gameboy
oh
by the way
um
yeah
maybe we should try something like that
i uh thought up a name for our product
but yeah
yeah
oh right
yeah
it's called uh the real remote
ooh
with a copyright sign after real
alright
yeah
the real remote
alright
yeah
i like it
okay
so maybe you can include that somewhere
good
this can go
yeah
we should work in our own room right
or not
yeah
oh yeah we have to f uh include that in our design as well
i don't see any power cables here so
let's see
yeah
yes
what the hell's that
i think uh it's the sensors
'kay
see you two in half an hour uh
okay
uh
good luck
yep
okay that's the side
ah it's it's okay
but do we want uh options on the on the side with the with the buttons
yeah
or just leave it
i think we do
uh could make an uh a volume button uh scroll volume button
yeah or j or also scrolling for the m yeah
for menu
yeah
or
i dunno
we w kind of wanted to stick with the
yeah
no yeah
yeah i'm just thinking if we i we wanna make something different right
so the with the scroll is is more futuristic than the standard arrow buttons
yeah
i think
mm
yeah you are going to design it so
okay
uh first of all i'll start with the costs because that's going to influence our design
oh no
oh
if you don't know if you al already had a look or not
did you do your questionnaire already
no n i i already did it
no
it's not much
it's just one question
because we have a problem
uh
oh
if you look closely you can see
yeah
it wants
um i already took the liberty to make some suggestions
at the moment we have fifteen buttons one l. c. d. screen one advanced chip on print
we use a uh sensor that's for the speech
uh we use kinetic energy
and we wanted uh the buttons in a special colour
okay
what's the first thing we should drop
the special colour of the buttons
no that's that's for the trendy uh feel and look
okay
so
yeah but everything is
uh
should we switch to a hand dynamo
uh that's the still the same idea as the kinetic energy because you have to use it and do things
no
yeah b but
yeah but young people like that
so just do normal battery
batteries
batteries
i think the battery option
just a normal battery then yeah
yeah
it has to be twelve and a half
yeah
or not
oh
oh my goodness
so
you're going to redesign something
oh no
okay so we're at twenty five
uh yeah
um
do we keep the shape doubly curved or g do we go for single curved
well i guess i we'll have to go for single curve then
i mean we have to drop on everything
mm-hmm
but we can keep it single curved with uh top view still curved
uh
but from the side it's it's flat and the screen screen is just well you just have to hold it like this then
yeah
so
yeah
how about sorry
um uh another option i saw was to drop the buttons one through nine
so you can't directly access a channel but instead use only the up and down arrows
that's what i was thinking
that would skip nine buttons and four and a half euros
yeah
alright
yeah
let's do it then
a a
yeah
uh then we have left
we
but we don't have any basic options any more
uh yeah
we do
and uh 'cause then they don't have to n they don't need special colour as well
f. eight
they don't need special colours
fine
that's more like it
yeah
you were saying something
that was exactly my point
like let's drop all the buttons and just make one i mean we're gonna use the l. c. d. screen anyway
yeah
mm-hmm
so we'll just have to use it for everything
yeah
and then you can make an overview of channels in the screen and select a channel click
yeah some more menu options
yeah
okay so maybe we can drop few more buttons
but um now let's look
yeah we c could we only need the the the the the menu arrow arrow button uh thing
everything you can do with with the menu
so with the display
mm-hmm
yeah we need one integrated button for everything then
yeah
the joystick
uh
yeah
kind of
i was because
yeah
yeah scroll wheel push button uh
integrated scroll wheel push button yeah
if you if you go to if you go to our uh view like you if you are in the sound system there
yeah
uh and you wanna adjust the treble for instance this is just uh an example
yeah
mm-hmm
y y you wanna see a bar on which you can adjust it from zero to ten for example
mm-hmm
mm-hmm
but you want a sound preview of how it's gonna sound right
so you wanna click on it activate it whe and when you move it hear the difference of the treble coming out or going into the sound
yeah
yeah
so you'll you'll need a a kind of a joystick uh button
yeah or or the integrated scroll wheel push button
yeah
so that's kind of on your mouse and then you can click it adjust it click again and then you're out of it
but you still but you then still need to have
exactly
well you can use the scroll wheel as well for um maybe for the channels
but you still um
yeah it's r yeah
you still have to have some some button in the menu to go back
so you do one inte you can do one integrated scroll wheel push button
yeah
and then just drop all the other buttons
uh yeah
well not all
not s not sound i guess
but but th the cost of one integrated button is far more than a few extra push buttons
no
yeah
it's uh one integrated button is five times the cost of a normal button
yeah
mm
so we have to to make it s uh more uh it has to be
so
you could also drop j three more of these without losing much functionality
yeah
you just drop the okay and the back
wh wh what what what is the what is the uh sample sensor sample speaker
oh that's for the speech
speech recognition
yeah
could drop the speech recognition
right
s s drop speech recognition
no but
yeah that's possible
we we d
yeah it's it's expensive but uh we never considered the possibilities of uh speech recognition
'cause it can take the function of a lot of uh uh buttons
buttons
buttons
that's not very easy to use
yeah
i
no it can be disturbed by by noise and
no
yeah but lets just say that the speech recognition works
stuff like that
let let let me see what's more what's more popular
i guess the the screen was more popular than um than the speech recognition
yeah
i have to look on that
let me see
uh well no i was wrong
there are more people who like speech recognition than an l. c. d. screen
yep
okay
because if you d lose the l. c. d. screen we need a lot of yeah
but if it
but it it it's a it's a both a hypers
we lose our whole concept
uh so no we just we keep the l. c. d.
we need a lot of extra buttons
no but well we yeah we keep the screen
i mean it's it's about the same
eight one to ninety one percent uh sixty six to seventy six
we uh we we haven't really integrated this the speech into the system so we can might as well s drop that
okay so we drop the speech
and drop it yeah
yeah
yeah
let's drop the speech
okay
s fo four less euros
sixteen euros
so we still have three and a half euro to lose
we need to lose some buttons
but y y
yeah if you lose the the back the okay button uh v let's say we only have the four arrows and the menu button
yeah
yeah
then you're
and then and then use um
oh and the power button we have also
the the okay
and the menu button does also does the okay function then
yeah
and then when you in the menu
so that's one euro
s so so you activate the menu
if we do uh two integrated scroll wheel push buttons we can drop all the the push buttons
yeah
yeah
with with one uh integrated button we can uh do the whole menu thing
and
yeah yeah
with the other we can do the the channel the volume et cetera
yeah
that would save zero point two euros compared to no
no it's three euros
no
um
yeah
no it's it's n yeah
to this together is more expensive than oof it's almost the same as t keeping this
yeah yeah yeah
well okay
and we can drop these two
for example if you have f f four buttons channel up and down uh volume left right okay i've i think we have to keep that
it's the
volume
and the power button
and then and the power button
so that's five
that's the basic
that's basic
that that's what you need anyway
and then for the menu um you can have a button that activates menu
or d or do we just integrate an an an scroll wheel with a push button
and then if the moment you use the scroll wheel the the the menu gets activated
and then you can scroll choose an option click on it it goes into an feature
click on it again selects features scroll adjust it
click again it's okay
then you only need one button to move back
or or under each option you set a you set an a screen thing what says back
and you select that one click again and you go one step back
and in that menu scroll click one step back
so that then you need five buttons and one integrated scroll wheel push button
yep
which that's even
but we can't drop three buttons
okay th that's yeah that's one euro more expensive
but i see that's yeah
so that's not a good idea
that's not an option
because which buttons do we have now
those five which i mentioned and then menu and then
menu power
yeah
f of the four things
four arrows
yeah th power
power
uh
which more
yeah if you if you go to eight i don't know how to
yeah
okay
so four arrows
yeah
uh power i believe
power
th yeah that's five
uh
we have a back and a okay button
yeah okay that's seven and one to activate the menu yeah
and the menu
so okay that's eight
well we can't reduce that
we we keep the display
oh well okay
yeah and even if we drop three buttons from here we still have to make some adjustments around here
so
yeah
yeah we need the chip for the for the l. c. display
the l. c. d.
yeah
let's make the let's make the case plastic
yeah well we need the advanced
instead of r
then i rather make it wood
because then also it's good in the market with the forty five plus uh people
yeah
yeah
yeah but but that's not our market
true
but
no that maybe not
but maybe it's better than plastic anyway
ah no hard plastic
oh
plastic with a with a special colour
a woo wood uh wood uh wood colour
yeah plastic with special colour
yeah
no but i i because we have to use the special colour anyway
that's an option
yeah okay uh
you forgot that
yeah
yep
yeah yeah
so let's go for the plastic
so we do one one s yeah
yeah okay
plastic
and since it's not kinetic it doesn't have to flip around that much
uh that's easy because plastic is free
hmm
hmm
we still have problem of two euros
yeah okay
uh if we dropped uh
no the buttons those are really needed
yeah
yeah we can't drop them
yeah th th it's it's uh
an advanced chip on print
yeah uh
do we really need that advanced chip for an l. c. d. display
you still need that
you uh uh
yeah
so the other option would be to go for the the sample speaker and which can use a regular chip wh which is six euros in total
s
that doesn't matter
oh
i rather keep i rather keep the display
no i keep the re yeah
well yeah
yeah
because we already designed for it
so the only option is an hand dynamo
so
exactly
oh that
yeah and something else
yeah but the uh can't we f uh fit all the buttons in an intreg integrated scroll push button
oh no tha oh that's one euro right
'cause that will save us one and a half euro already
and then if w
and then integrated s yeah but that would make it not so easy to use
no y you would rec
i mean it's not that important easy to use but
then you have
th then we have to scroll through a lot of menus to be able to get where you want huh
then you still need two additional buttons i believe
and uh
yeah
for the volume
yeah d at l yeah
you can use those yeah
at least one for power
but the
oh yeah and power
that's three buttons and this would cost
oh
yeah it's just as expensive as what we have now
but the integrated uh button
yeah
how many func functions can it uh have
three
up down okay
yeah endlessly
i mean it can be a power button as soon as it powered on
okay
you can go into you in you main menu you can choose uh flip channel uh you can choose sound options any options
you you press it for like three seconds
then then then you should do everything in the menu
yeah
on the screen
maybe we should
yeah okay
it would save enough yeah you can choose this drop these then we have a half euro left
'cause we don't have money and w we want the screen
yeah
so we can maybe still use power button
yeah but we'd alright
yeah
i guess we have to
it s it saves us four euros and it costs us two and a half
so let's see we we drop the price by one and a half
we'll we'll be on
yeah
you see
but we still have thirteen left
oh still yeah
oh then i miscalculated
oh yeah
thirteen
so still half
shit
there goes the special co well that would make it less appealing
drop the special colour
oh no
so that's no option
'kay
what else
uncurved
no no it has to be um curved
we sure about the advanced chip we need for the display
yeah
yeah it says right here
they made it very easy for us
okay
well yeah
yeah
we made it hard for ourselves with the display but it's a cool feature
ah i don't think i can s uh persuade the management to say this is better for the market so you sell more than
okay
wh what we could do is um
drop the the special colour and uh do the special colour for the buttons
yeah
buttons
that's oh yeah since we only have one button
yeah
yeah but i mean what is meant by special colour
i just m i don't i think uh yeah it's i think it's grey regular
just something else than than black or white i think
s yeah
alright
grey and rubber
but we definitely want the thing to be a special colour though
of plastic
yeah
yeah
so i rather have an hand dynamo than than drop the colour
damn
yeah and then
yeah yeah yeah yeah
yeah
you can still play with it then i guess
i don't know
yeah
yeah but a hand dynamo costs a lot of energy to keep the screen working
so i guess that isn't an option
the display
well you only have to power it up when you wanna use it
yeah
the
yeah
but if you have to power the for ten minutes then the
i don't know
yeah
no i don't think the current status of uh chips are pretty uh energy conserving no
yeah
yeah true
yeah
let's let's go for the hand dynamo then
yeah hand dynamo
do you want an extra button
or or do we or do we do uncurved and flat
instead of
no no it has to be curved
yeah it has to be curved and has to have that colour
yeah
yeah
just put a special special colour of the buttons or something
yeah
and a screen
yeah
that's the most import
yep
instead of an additional power button
yeah or spe special form
yeah
s what what is special f oh yeah special form
yeah
maybe that's nicer
it's for scroll
yeah
but we don't have any buttons
without
so do d uh make it a special colour then
we only have
yeah
but it's it's for the integrated button i think also
or
yeah ma make it a special colour then
yeah but
yeah but it's just a scroll wheel which you can push down
yeah
okay
yeah
so
okay
make it a special colour and then it look fancy
yeah
yep
so woah we're within budget
so
yeah
it's a miracle
oh just oh ma make it two special colours but we only have one button
let's let's save it
yeah
okay
let's do it like this i mean because it does not lose our identity of the product as we
yeah
okay
um well
'kay this was old
well we come back to the drawing board then huh
yeah all your designs are uh pretty much
yeah
yeah back to work
okay
uh
it's silly 'cause we we should have had this meeting before we start drawing
did i save it
yeah
yeah but that but that's the fun part of it
i i wanted to go but i wasn't allowed
oh yeah
so
okay
alright
uh i just forgot to save this
just a minute
yeah what's the next uh phase
yeah this the last phase of course so
uh the agenda
by your humble p. m.
hmm
oh f frustrated
oh
alright
yeah
okay
um
well we first should have had a uh prototype presentation
but well as you saw that hadn't made no sense because we had to drop it
drop everything
drop yeah
yeah
uh
we went straight into finance
yeah
yeah it was more important so i just
yeah
for yeah
yeah
pushed up the agenda
yeah
uh
evaluation criteria
you have t produced something about that
yeah that that's yeah
i uh i sure did
and it combines with product evaluation
uh so
uh you put it in the
we all have to keep in mind what has changed now
so what we have left on the because evaluation is based on the initial uh user requirements
yeah
alright
let's make it big
f. five
um
well we evaluate uh the design with a seven point scale as following
well the remote controls according criteria blah blah blah
true or false and then on a scale of seven points a scale as we all know it
mm-hmm
um
well the criteria are based on the user requirements uh the trends from the marketing research and the marketing strategy of the company itself
um well they are in a word document which i will open now
alt up
yeah
i don't know it's open yet
no
and we all have to uh agree on a certain level
what's this
freaky
oh
i don't know
um
well the first point is the remote control matches the operating behaviour of the young user
so that means the operating behaviour was using quite a lot of functions
how do you think about that
i think it does
because the operating behaviour of the young user was also defined in colour and shape and the use of l. c. d. right
yeah
uh of course we dropped a little bit of those uh
yeah the us u
it it it's it's mainly con mainly concentrating on a lot of functions in this question
yeah
mm-hmm
so do you think
well we have extended menus on the on the l. c. d. screen
yeah
you can you can ma yeah you can make a lot of extended menus
yep
so
that's true
i mean the the possibilities are almost unlimited to to build in menus in the screen
i
no
so on a scale from
one to seven what do you think
two or three
huh
two or three
two or three
something like that
well we have to choose one
two
yeah
so uh what do you say
uh y we should fill this in now
i agree on two
yeah
yeah okay
i uh i say two personally
uh
but
yeah
yeah in the new design i s would say it's three
yeah alright
but now in original design i say two
yeah well we have to evaluate i guess what we have now
okay then i say three
yeah
you say three and you you said al also three
yeah yeah
three
yeah
okay well i say still two but it has to be three then
hey you're marketing eh
yeah i know
so it's made bold
but it's nah it's not very clear on the sc maybe other colour yeah
hmm
m maybe underline
or give it a colour
that's better
red
uh
yeah
alright
oh it doesn't have to be bold anymore
oh yeah very true
alright
yeah
yeah true one
um well the remote control has wha
he types everything
definitely one
yeah
it has to be
the remote control has irrelevant or less used functions
for example audio settings and screen settings
it hides uh basic functions
everything
yeah
you're not gonna find them
you don't use anything else
well yeah
so it it's a very true point
i mean it hides all those function
yeah
yeah okay
yeah
but i mean uh they're hidden in the screen
yeah true
if you don't want to use them you don't s you s just scroll over them
and you place them
mm-hmm
f i don't know where
so that's very true i guess for our case
uh the second point
yeah the next not so much so
it shows the relevant and most used functions
nope
power button
do we ha still have a power button
uh check with the excel sheet
well yeah the button's integrated huh
yeah
i think we are
yeah it's uh it's integrated
yeah we dropped it
you j you just push it in for yeah just just push it in for th for three seconds or something and then yeah
it's in oh yeah it was integrateds
yeah integrate it
yeah
e exactly just like a m mobile
yeah
i don't know
just go scrolling and it will activate
yeah
um it shows the relevant and most used functions
yeah uh on the other uh on one side i would say yes and the other side i would say no
so it's i don't know
it shows the most used functions and they are relevant but
can you uh change channels directly with with just one button
yeah
no you have to scroll through the menu before
with the scroll butt yeah and then say channel
and then
yeah
so it's it's not
well uh we should b build it so that if you don't kind of push into the menu or something
if when it's on yeah it's turned on
hmm
you say you double click on the
it automatically has the the programme and the volume function
yeah
but as soon as you click it you go into the menu or some of you or you double click it
yeah
but but how do you change from volume to channel
no because it has four arrows right
no not anymore
no
no
because he's now have a scroll wheel that you can push in
oh yeah
yeah
yeah i was thinking still about our uh integrated joystick
like on the the mouse
no we have n we have no buttons left
so the joystick was not an option
say
yeah that is a bummer
so so you hav so you you have to double click i mean
yeah
for i mean uh volume and three double click for the menu or something
to get into menu
yeah
oh no
or hold it ten seconds
we'll make it a morse code
yeah
yeah
yeah
alright
but but ease of use was not very important may i remind you
no no no
so that's yeah but that that's not a question
uh it should be trendy
uh the remote control shows the relevant and most used functions
well i think it's pretty much in the middle
yeah
four
you have to search for them in in the in the s in the screen in the menu
yeah im in the menu
so
yeah
seven
so maybe it's more like a f a five
yeah
or
yeah i would go for five or six yeah
five
yeah
five or six
five
okay five
five
yep
five
alright
let's not diss our remote
yeah
it's the weirdest remote control i've ever seen
oh
so
yeah
yep
just one button
well it's different
yeah
alright
uh the the remote control makes use of technolog technological innovation like l. c. d. screen and speech recognition
but uh yep
yeah
well yeah but we dropped the speech recognition
yeah it's still
but it has at least one innovation
yeah i say two
we still have the fruit and vegetable print
i say two then
yeah
yeah but that that's not that's not this question
oh that's the next
fr oh i mean the oh never mind
uh thi uh that's the other question
i'm a bit lost
this one
i think a two
two
two yeah
no
i think l. c. d. 's more useful than speech what
yep
yeah definitely
oh not the bold one
it's way more practical yeah
right
okay it has a fancy look and feel by using fruit and vegetable prints primary colours and sponge like material
it should have been two questions
yeah
i realise now because sponge like material is dropped
but the look and feel
you still have rubber d or no
yeah
so we still uh we still have the primary colours
no you got a plastic
yeah
yeah
but only on the on the outside not on the button
yeah
the button has also colour
yeah
yeah
yeah
okay
the one button we have
yeah
yeah
yeah still we we dropped also on the the double uh curve
the one
yeah you could check with the excel sheet
mm mm
yeah
you only have one yeah
yeah we have single curve now and no and no material
and and colour
yeah
s
so maybe in the middle or something
four
yeah
yeah
yeah
yeah i mean it's
yeah or three
uh
worth the yeah
we have something
actually we d we didn't do so well on this one
because it's basically an old one uh with little curve on the side and in a different colour
still it's still hard
yeah
i mean the sponge like and the three d. shape that would give it something young and fresh
new
yeah
yeah
but then we would have to drop the screen
red
oh red
yeah
you like both
yeah
i like bold
uh the remote control displays the corporate logo
um oh yeah
mm yeah yeah
of course
i just couldn't um just one minute
yeah
you just have to draw it
yeah but it be because uh we couldn't hardly draw on the b s on the lower half of the screen
it's the white part uh
we could not make it big enough to actually draw in the
yeah
yeah
so i mean i wanted to put digits on the buttons as well
we have a we have a
so
but
but there's uh enough space for the corporate logo
i mean if there's only one thing
hell yeah
if we have only one button
yeah
so i will say that is very true
mm-hmm
and even the shape we have now uh simulates kind of an r. and the reversed r. doesn't it
yeah
the remote control is easy to use
so
well i would say skill uh i would say six or something
no
i don't think it's easy to use or not so
the only e the only thing easy about it is that you don't have to move your fingers
ah i
yeah
'cause it has only one button
and that you only have to control one button
yeah
yeah exactly
it it it has a nice screen
but yeah
it gives visual feedback
so
yeah
well i i would say a five or a six
i would say six
i think a five
five
what do you say
easy to use
it's really not easy to use
five or a six
'cause you're putting everything
no not anymore
so a six more
yeah
yeah uh i would go for the six too
okay
yeah
so
most votes count
um
um well another question uh the remote control is durable
yeah that looks uh great
i don't know if that's the correct word
yeah
definitely in casing 'cause we have a hard plastic yeah
but uh
nah
in use both battery as casing
yeah
yeah because the the batteries those thingies last forever
true true
and the the casing hard plastic also lasts forever
and the casing is plastic
yep
yeah
if you don't drop it too much it's uh should last pretty long
yeah
so i would go for one
yeah
but uh i think rubber compared is better
yeah
so i think a two is more appropriate
s
yep
okay yeah
than
wow
yeah
logo
yeah
okay i will go go for two
uh the last one
the remote control's a good example for company's motto we put the fashion in electronics
oh
no m
no we put the electronics into the fashion
yeah well yeah
i would g i would go for four
uh turn around
yeah
but um
yeah
no
because we kind of tried to but we kind of failed with the budget that we have
it's not
yeah true
yeah okay
so a four
it's it g it g goes it's not the best we could do i guess
yeah
but it all has to do with the budget because it's it's not the bad idea we had so
yeah
yeah yeah
yeah four is okay
alright yeah
right
so
so if i understood it right we have to count these numbers
that's it
ooh
and yeah
uh
what
yeah
mm-hmm
oh
yeah
oh alright
word document the yeah we have to count them
yeah
that
count them
uh
add them
or
yeah just add them and then uh divide them
could somebody start calculator
yeah
mm
i all made it po i i all made it i all made it possible uh for a positive questions so we can count it
ah we can do the math
uh
mm-hmm
i mean if you have reversed question you have to reverse the scale uh yes
yeah yeah
you have to 'kay
yeah
so four and
did you make this questionnaire or what
yeah
thanks
nice work
okay
oh
three plus
i wouldn't be able to do it that fast
o one
plus one
plus five
plus five
oh easy
bo
question number four yeah
uh two
yeah
f
four
oh
wait a second
oh
it's it's gone wrong
how hard is it
okay
it's your turn
yeah just use oh there tho uh there's no n there's no num pads
pretty difficult
start over
no it's if you press twice on the plus button then you get s s
you can oh yeah
no
that's why it's uh
it's a it's a bit uh
just type in the digits
they're all one digit numbers right
and then you can count them together
yeah
i think you can just count them by a um let's move over
just count it to yeah
okay
three plus one four
three four nine
nine
uh
uh yeah
are you here
eleven
eleven
eleven fifteen
fifteen
fifteen
sixteen
sixteen
sixteen yeah
seventeen
seventeen
no sixteen
uh sixteen plus six
oh what
twenty two
s uh
how hard is this
twenty two
twenty two yeah
never mind
twenty four
tw
twenty four
twenty six
twenty eight
oh sorry
twenty twenty eight
oh my
that was the last one
that was that
twenty eight
yeah
okay
twenty eight
so divided by nine
twen uh okay
by nine
hmm
that's uh three uh or le less than a three
so
yeah the lower the the lower the score the better right
yeah
yeah
twenty eight
yeah but
divided by nine
di divided by nine makes three point one one one one one one one
so thr t two
so we're better than average
but
yeah
i are you sure we this number actually tells us somethings
no
i don't think so because some questions are related to positive issues and some to negative
some questions are yeah
so if you give a true to a positive it actually means that the low the lower the better
but if you give true to a negative question
yeah but there are no negative questions i guess
no
good example
durable use
durable that's good
easy to use
easy to use
this is good
fancy look and feel that's good
yeah
technology innovation was good because of a marketing uh requirement
also good
re relevant most used function
yeah okay
i guess you did do it
and hides these functions
that was also a good thing
oh yeah
yeah
oh yeah yeah
and then matches the opera of the user was also a good thing
no
yeah
okay
so it were all positive questions by uh by purpose
okay
yeah true
so
yes so the it tells us something yes
becau but the picture would be a lot different if we didn't have to drop those uh those things i guess
oh great
things yeah
yeah definitely definitely
okay
because now it's just an average it's remote
yeah
nah it it's it's better than average but
yeah okay because of the l. c. d. screen
but uh it looks and stuff it still uh it's not it's not really eye catching except for the colour
yeah
so th
it's still yeah
yeah
has some shortcomings
no
the colour and the screen
yeah
okay so um this we had this we had
product evaluation
we have to do a product evaluation
uh prototype presentation we dropped
so uh the finance we looked
we have redesigned
uh not on that but
yeah we we have to maybe if we have to redesign it on this
okay it's your turn now
so you can just make one big l. c. d. screen
shall we try
with some casing around it yeah
black
okay uh we're still gonna go for the fancy colours
yeah uh
yeah
yeah
but are we gonna stick with the green or are we gonna do blue
yeah we we can just uh use this one
and then uh over paint it with uh uh the green uh he only needs one button
the the button has a special colour the frame has a special colour
yeah
one scroll button and
it's plastic
yeah
or we have to delete this one or
and single curved
yeah
oh and you might want to add a uh infrared led
oh oh no
oh yeah
otherwise it uh doesn't function uh so well
for what
okay
yeah
so that's
do we have to do other things
well i have to um um make an uh report of every decision we made so far
or just redesign
alright
and i try to get chip just before uh i uh receive the excel sheet
yeah
so i
so you made a start right
yeah i'm i'm somewhere but maybe you can help me
should give it some time
yeah
yay
uh
okay but how do we make the the scroll uh button
i was here
so
it's just one yeah
have to take this away also
alright
ah
and this um
uh that's the infrared uh thing
oh yeah of course
the the target group has a weak spot for fruit and vegetables like primary colours spongy shape
yeah
um pen yeah
format
current colour red
the playfulness we decided to use kinetic energy as a power sour
oh yeah we did our special colour for the line widths now that's a ten
yeah
okay
that's conceptual yes
that's enough to get started with so
yeah
um uh it's just a scroll yeah is it's horizontal or vertical
mm
it's gonna be one str scroll
how many pages
uh i just took one for every step and then a conclusion
alright
i think
y you have you have done the first two
horizontal's easier too 'cause you can
yeah
okay and and the look and feel is
yeah
is it more natural than this
well i think i have to make a p an issue called finance
yeah yeah
so let's say whoops
'kay
yeah
yes
basically
it doesn't look like uh
the items we had to drop
yeah
uh it it's it's not yeah
it's not very fashionable anymore
but uh it's okay
it's really ugly
yeah
where did we start with price
twenty six and a half
maybe m make it bigger
or
mm-hmm
or not
or twenty six
something like that
yeah
that looks little bit more uh
maybe that's a s a special colour for it
oh
this
so we can make it uh special
what do you mean
like a other colour than this one
or or speckles in it
i dunno
uh
speckles
yeah can we do it uh uh can we do a print
i'm not sure
i think we have to choose yeah
i don't think so if you see the options
uh
but
okay special colour
we do have special colour
does it mean uh that
yeah red is already a special colour i think
so
it's not very special but uh
yeah
shall we just give it some dots to make it look pretty
yeah
purdy
just uh put the purple uh purple on it
yeah
some some big dots
purple
that's trendy
yeah
yeah yeah
oh no my remote has acne
we have the original balance sheet or yeah
yeah
woah
no
that's why we have that button
oh yeah
it's so cute
hmm
oh what
doh
woah
just cut
control z.
oh no
is that that
yeah
no no
yeah
yeah
how the we did we do that
oh it's it's just one computer
just dual screen
or
no
but can we delete it just with delete
or
we can try
that doesn't respond also to the undo
it looks like it's
crashed
no
oh no
very nice
okay
where do you want some more dots
yeah over here
hmm
you can't even draw anymore
yeah
even children can draw
what's this
y y you you you push the button or something
or
can you just push pen and then keep on
oh yeah
oh that's the select button
it's uh
hmm
okay it's not the prettiest i know
no it looks
it's not so random huh
lot of options
it's okay
specially the the r.
yeah the r. and another r.
yeah okay
it's called the real remote right
yeah
maybe maybe it c it can say that
the real remote
yeah just on the the m um the l. c. d. display
yeah
welcome
we can make a l a logo
this is your real remote
yeah
yeah
like uh put it like the shape
yeah
d designed by okay
something like that
i mean it's not too uh
that's not their logo is it
no
do they have a lo oh the here
this i this is the logo
yeah
it's a
two r. s and a one
yeah
you can just reuse that because the name is the same
you can copy and paste the picture if you want
initials
how shall we do the logo in black or not
mm
yeah
yeah
what is that
look more looks more like a campfire
are you dissing my drawing
this one
yeah
it looks like a ribbon
yeah
okay
so who wants to draw
this is actually quite fun
do we need to do anything
i hear you people are typing
are we uh ready
uh or
type in your report
oh okay
i don't see any new messages
so
luckily
hmm
luckily yeah
is this uh the last assignment
or
yeah it's uh yeah
final
it's almost four
what time do we have to deliver the report
at four yeah
four o'clock or
or before that
okay
just compare uh
and copy this
just a minute
this is really bizarre
it's
it looks like there's a it looks like a butterfly
um bug
bug
it's somewhere
i d it isn't inside
no it's in inside the
yeah and don't know how it's or eject it
no it's on the on the beamer i guess
no it oh
no but it i it's not a bu a beamer
from up there
no
b it's a normal t. v. screen kind of thing
hey you've got it uh read only
yeah it's somewhere in here
so you have to uh
save copy
yeah
strange
this something what's projection from behind i guess
yeah
it's too uh
oh
yeah there is some kind of projection i think
yes
yeah it it's a beamer but then with a within a mirror yeah
with a with a mirror huh
or something
yeah
so it looks like a big screen but in fact it isn't
so are we gonna change anything to this
it is
i mean is it gonna
well it's it's single single curved
well
it's now single curved
so
th this is flat
this is gonna be flat
it's flat
yeah exactly
oh no
yeah
okay
it doesn't matter
it's it's
but it's it's better to have in the front this kind of shape because it looks nice
i mean you see more of this than of that
yeah
yeah more like that
yeah
and this is also gonna be
it's not very uh ideal
nope
do like this
but sometimes then uh all of a sudden it does work
yeah
what's this
that's the detector uh for the
ooh
okay
maybe
but i don't see a detector over there
yeah
no it's i think you only need two points
i don't know
or not
no you sh
i thought it was a kind of thing to put it on and then draw right lines or something
maybe that's why it's it's not working because it's more
slanted yeah
yeah
yeah
yeah
or just messed it up
well maybe
oh
yeah
oh yeah
yeah it it matters for the aim of this thing
yeah
yeah but it wasn't good
you've to make it s uh
ninety degrees
yeah it it has to touch the corners i guess
but th this one wasn't good because if i was drawing here i drew a line and then it came over here
um now you probably have to recalibrate
you have
oh five minutes to the end of the meeting
oh
oh we're always long
and the recalibration is done using this icon here
yeah can we t can we get to that i
ooh
oh it's not working anymore
yeah yeah it's it's okay
yeah well i just
oh yeah yeah yeah yeah it's it's working it's working
it's working again
yeah
okay
it's better than before
yeah
yeah
we're improving uh yeah
you go ahead
yeah that's improved uh pretty much
yeah
yeah it's only a bit like to that side but that is that one by the way
yeah
yeah but it's better it's better
'cause this one makes the angle either like this
no it
so i if i change this it will go there if i change that will go there
mm
no
it's better than it was i guess
mm-hmm
i will take this away 'cause it looks messy
silly
yeah
works pretty well
five minutes before the meeting's over
yeah
and then
yeah
we have to present
then i have to uh uh write this and i don't know if you have to present because i didn't receive any information about that so far
alright
maybe we will
maybe we get a a final mail
so it after the after after these five minutes you have to
yeah
yeah i have still ten minutes to finish the report
what's this anyway
so cake
alright
after after that five minutes you have ten minutes to finish it or alright
it looks like candle wax
yeah
and we uh
and you can uh just uh relax and uh have cup of coffee or oh no they don't have beer here so you can't celebrate
right
chill
huh
you can just if you ma finish my presentation please
uh over there
uh yeah
the presentation is still open
so if you finish that then you'll see uh
yeah next
next slide
oh yeah we have to do the project uh evaluation
just uh do that quickly
yeah
uh
how do you do it
uh well basically what that says we discuss it and um
alright
so how were did the project process uh go
did you were you all pleased with the process as it was
or are there uh
uh th uh do you mean the the interaction between us
yeah the interaction and the steps we followed and and so forth
or
yeah well at first i was really stressed
because it went a bit fast
yeah
but then as i knew the tempo that i had to be on the second time i think i did a bit better
yeah
yeah
and the third time yeah i mean
and we move more to to working together as team because at first you you make your individual contribution
no
mm-hmm
and then come here and you have no idea what the others have to make
no
yeah yeah yeah yeah
and then finally you have some idea
okay this is gonna w this is what we gonna make together and okay i will arrange this and you will arrange that
mm-hmm
and you have a k a kind of idea what you can expect on the next half hour when you have to work on your own
so
the process i mean the interaction between us became better and better i guess
yeah we
yeah
yeah
mm-hmm
especially after the first meeting
mm-hmm
yeah especially if f f if you see uh you se you saw the largest difference from the first to the second meeting i guess
and
yeah
yeah
definitely
okay and was that due to my leadership
yeah yeah yeah
well you did become more assertive the the second time round so that yeah
yeah
yeah
yeah
that okay
you were more in charge kind of thing
okay
um was there uh enough room for creativity
i guess so
yeah
yeah but only the the financial parts uh yeah
i mean
li limiteded afterwards but
if if you don't take that into account there's plenty of room for creativ creativity
i
also not only the drawing and the the making of the thing itself but also in explaining it to the other people by means of uh
we were pretty democratic
the the board and uh powerpoint and word and stuff like that
so and the uh about the board digital pen
uh was that helpful or
yeah
mm uh i think in in essence
ooh
the digital pen is better than the smartboard
because it it it just works better
i mean uh uh i've made yeah uh i've made several notes just to test it
yeah it works
and and just put the pen in into it and then it came onto my screen and it looked perfectly
yeah
so it it's better a better device than uh
mm-hmm
maybe yeah
than the screen
but the screen is useful in essence but it doesn't work that well
it's uh it's the the pen is more intuitive 'cause we're all used to writing with pen
use the pen
and uh as i said uh i uh have no idea how powerpoint works
so will take me half a day to be able to make a normal powerpoint presentation
yeah
but once i get to know the program probably i mean it looks better you know
or uh something like that
you can
give it a kind of a home style like we have i
the the logo and everything
yeah yeah
and i don't know
yep
blink
oh
warning
finish meeting now
finish meeting
okay are are there any new ideas about this
all i think
i didn't really receive yeah
well it it's use especially useful i guess to to evaluate designs and graph graphical stuff
uh uh w uh s sorry uh
and and
the screen and stuff like that
mm-hmm
i think the powerpoint is is too limited
you can't uh draw easy in in powerpoint
it has to be uh yeah
the drawing board has to be integrated into powerpoint so that you can just easily
yeah
yeah the the the problem with powerpoint for me is that you have to i put in the pre made chunks c as well
yeah
you know you can draw something on the sketch board and then take it there or whatever
yeah
yeah
yeah
but it it's useful to to show something to to an a small audience and then to
yeah just for text for text it's uh it's okay
but
yeah
these these kind of screens this size are useful to discuss things
so
oh
yes
check your email
uh we should uh enter our questionnaire
you also
'kay
ah
woah
alright
right
okay
okay
uh okay
alright
yes boss
well s see you in a second huh
that's the management
well see you soon
oh
okay
hope so
yeah
um
yeah we have to pull it this way huh
wait
hi
hi
hello
oh
good morning
good morning
morning
good morning
uh before i start with the with the meeting i have a few things to tell you about the the setting we're in
uh because we're uh being watched by uh big brother
so um yeah
by big brother
yeah
okay
this uh these are cameras so are these
mm-hmm
this thing uh that looks like a pie are actually all microphones
yeah
okay
so you must be careful with uh with uh all this
and uh as i can see you uh you have placed your laptops uh exactly on the place where it must be
and that has to do with the camera settings so we don't have our uh laptops in front of the cameras
of our faces
and indeed
so they can see our faces
okay
welcome at the kick off meeting
my name is uh danny wolfs
uh this is the agenda for today
uh first a little opening
uh i will introduce myself uh and uh i think it's very uh good to introduce uh yourself
uh then uh a little bit of acquaintance acquaintance to uh to to ourselves
so uh we get to know each other
uh that will be done uh with a tool training from the he these two uh smart boards
then the project plan
what we're going to do and how we're going to do it
uh and discussion about that and a little closing at the end
okay uh my name is uh danny wolfs
i'm the project manager
what's your name
i'm juergen toffs
i'm the user interface designer
user interface okay
hi my name's uh
i'm the industrial designer
industrial yes
i'm uh tim
um my function is the marketing expert
okay thank you
first a little about the project aim
uh the the the aim is to make a new remote control
uh maybe you have read uh read the website
it's a very uh yeah very uh ambitious uh company
they uh they wanna do something else
i w uh there must be a new remote control
uh first of all uh it must be original uh and trendy
that's two things really uh close to each other
but at the same time uh user friendly
and they have uh yeah that's uh very important uh for them
uh there are three stages
there is a functional design
so uh what are we going uh to uh to do
what are we going to uh uh make f uh kind of functions in the remote
and why are we going to do it
then the conceptual design
how are going to do it
and that's uh really global
uh because at the detailed design how part two
uh we go uh to dig in uh really about how the the te the technical of if it's uh it's possible technical wise
uh each stage is uh uh is broken up in two uh two stages individual work and a meeting
so it's uh it's very straightforward
okay the tool training
we have two smart boards
this one is for the presentations the powerpoint presentations or the word presentation of whatever you uh you had
uh and this is uh only for uh drawing
so uh we uh must let it uh stand on this uh this programme
this is called a smart board
speaks for itself
thing uh yeah it speaks for itself
um and as you uh may have heard the documents in the shared folder uh can be uh showed on this screen
not in y the the my documents
so if you wanna show something put it in the shared folder
uh
this uh is very straightforward with the save the print the undo the blank the select the pen
well i don't uh gonna explain it all because i think you know uh how it works
um we must not forget uh everything we draw on here uh all must be saved
we we may not delete anything
so uh if you have uh drawn something save it
never delete it
that's a very important uh thing
okay
uh little uh little kinda exercise to uh know each other
at uh the white board on the left
every uh every one of us uh must draw our favourite animal and uh tell uh tell us why we uh had uh chosen that animal
uh important is that we use different colours and uh different pen widths
widths
widths
i have a question
yes
um this exercise um did the company board tell you to do it or uh did you just make it up yourself
yeah
no no no
it's uh it's uh i i i must do it
it's part of the introduction okay
yeah yeah yeah
'cause we uh really don't know each other and uh it's kinda new
so getting used to each other we can uh have a little fun then before we uh dig in really to the hard stuff
okay
that kind of thing
would you start with drawing your uh favourite animal
um yeah
i don't know really how it works
but maybe you can show us first
okay okay
yeah okay
drawing goes with uh this thing
do not touch your hand on uh this little uh thingy here
that's uh important
so hold it uh like this
you g you get electrocuted or
yeah kinda
so um
you must p p uh push a little uh good
because and uh wait uh wait a few seconds
it's not uh fully real time so uh watch it
ach
oh yeah
well i'm gonna paint in the red
ooph
oh
that's the background colour
well undo
um
the pen
no
one minute please
yeah that's the one
well five
okay
my favourite animal huh
it's like pictionary
yeah you can guess what it is
the the one who says it first gets a raise
may uh paint uh next
it's a pork
no it's not an orc
you don't see it uh at the ears
mm yeah i have it at home
you have an orc at home
very artistic
thank you
so it's a cat
what's it called
simba
ah
'cause uh we have a cat at home and he's called simba
'cause he looks like the uh the the lion from the lion king
okay
miniature size
so we uh found it kinda cool to uh name it after a lion
okay
he's happy with us so uh
he's smiling
wow
he does have body uh
huh
no only the face
because we have we have twen twenty five minutes
okay
so we uh yeah
we have to speed up
remember you use uh different colours and different pen widths
yeah
okay who wants to go next
i okay
yeah
so choose a colour choose a pen width and draw a
you don't have to change the colour and the pen width during uh the drawing
save it
or
yeah
you have to save it
save it okay
i've done it
new
'kay
you have to draw uh push hard on the pen or uh
mm uh
not really
um
kind of firm touch
that one
oh
uh hmm
yeah
okay
open
which one is it
smart board
okay
okay
yeah
and now
okay
okay thanks
'kay i've speed up
'kay that's fine
line width
by the way why was your cat uh red
because uh my cat is red uh at home
oh okay
oh
and i have red hair so uh must be red
oh yeah sure
it's a very bloody cat
it's a frog
no it's a turtle
uh it's an apple
it's not an apple
must be a dog
a dog
yeah
hmm
colour
something like this
smaller
huh
oh it is a turtle
it is a turtle
why a turtle
why
tim
um
'cause i liked teenage mutant hero turtles
you watched it a lot
uh
you watched it a lot
it's uh inside its shell
you'll be uh finished sooner
no it's uh
it's a scared turtle
no no
it's coming up
mm
uh
wow
okay tim
something like this
thank you
okay you know very artistic
jurgen you want to go next
yes
okay
yeah
wha thank you
here you go
yeah
um
how did it work
format
performance
and then you have the the current colour you can change
so no red or green
and a pen
and uh line uh width
i had five
tim had uh tim what kinda line width did you have
um
uh the big lines were like nine
okay
it's a dog
well very good
uh
i just uh thought i'd pick the easiest one
okay
why a dog
you have a dog at home
well we had a dog a few years ago
uh it's p
had a dog
yeah
and and it yeah when it died we didn't get a new one or something
ah
it's pretty good uh
but uh
you have an artistic uh inner middle
an artist
uh a graphical user designer so
hmm
hey
think you uh picked the wrong uh function
wrong job
oh
no
can work together
ah colour
so i think you can see it's real uh really a easy programme to use
not difficult at all
wha
well it's okay
okay thank you
that's enough thanks
janus
yeah sure
the last one
yeah
uh thanks
i wonder
yeah
after a cat a turtle and a dog
i think he's gonna draw an elephant
i figure i should do something like that but i'm gonna do something much more difficult
uh oh
uh oh
oh he is the artistic design
i'm gonna design a remote uh remote control animal
remote control animal
exactly
oh
uh
sorry
well with the interface it might be easier to ha to draw here and display there uh
yeah
that that might be easier
but at the other hand uh a pen like that is easy to hold in your hand and
no
i think it's easier to draw
better to draw with a with
yeah
with a pen than with a mouse mouse
than on the with yeah i m i mean like uh like on here drawing drawing uh
mouth
oh okay
and then displaying on screen but
yeah
w with this paper it's too mu too expensive
but what is he uh
too expensive yeah
is it a rabbit
yes
do you have a rabbit at home
no
it's a rabbit with uh broken legs
a green rabbit
no
is it a white rabbit f it's the white rabbit from the matrix
yeah exactly
okay then yeah
there the g white green rabbit
so
he's a little bit stoned there
uh i figured this is a pretty b good impression of a rabbit
yeah
it will do
uh uh
uh well
okay
finishing touch and then we're going further
project manager
uh
yeah
where does the pen go
just uh
have you been uh counting the time
yeah a little
okay
let's go on then
well i think the dog is the the most uh artistic
uh i figured the rabbit was actually the most uh impressive
don't choose for youself
oh sorry
that's selfish
okay now we're gonna dig into the to the serious stuff
it's pretty abstract
uh the selling price for the remote will be uh twenty five euro and the production cost uh may not be more than uh twenty and a half euro
so uh from my point of view i don't think it's uh gonna be very uh very high tech high definition
uh ultra modern uh kinda remote for twelve uh fift uh twelve and a half euro
uh the profit we must make with uh the new remote is uh fifty million
euro
so that's a lot
we have to sell uh a lot of uh
yeah how much is it
like how much
hundred million uh remotes or something
uh i think uh w when the selling price is twenty five uh uh you got two million two million remotes
oh yeah
twenty million
two million oh yeah two million
yeah
but our marketing range is uh market range is international
so we have uh virtually the whole world we can sell uh
we can sell our r remotes to
at least that uh countries which have uh a television
yeah
um
so now it's time uh for us to uh going uh to discuss a little uh things
you can think about uh experience with a remote control uh yourself at home
what you think might be uh a useful uh new feature
what uh what can distinguish our new trendy remote control from all the others
um so uh let's uh let's uh discuss a little
i'm gonna join you at the table
well what what's the most uh important thing at a remote control
um well i think the most important thing of a remote control is that you can switch channels
and my opinion is you should keep it as basic as possible
okay
uh
so not a not a remote control who uh uh which can uh can be used for television and a d. v. d. and radio and or just only
yeah
i think so
uh but i have some points
can i show them on the on the big screen
if you have them on uh i can uh
maybe
yeah
yeah i can find uh
okay
oh in case you want it
this is a dead kind of fly
between the the the yeah the the uh
screen
yeah be the screens
okay
is it possible to open pen drawings in this uh on this screen
no no no
only all the drawings go there at the left uh
uh but um which the ones we made on the
oh that pen drawings
uh no i think uh when it is uh in word and you have saved it in the shared documents folder you can show it there
oh only in word okay
yeah
okay i have some uh points from marketing point of view
yeah
um just the standard thing li things like uh intuitive uh small fairly cheap
uh it's pretty cheap twenty five euros
uh brand independent
um i think it doesn't have to matter uh which brand your t. v. or other thing is
yeah
um
okay
five minutes
five minutes
okay i'll wrap it up quickly
yeah
um i personally think it has to be multi purpose
uh most of the remote c uh remote controls are uh just for one purpose
yeah
yeah
and uh by making it multi purpose it uh has a new feature adds a new feature to the market and distinguish from uh from current products
mm-hmm
um maybe some other technology than infrared
uh i rather find it very annoying um like when someone is standing in front of the t. v. then you can't switch it
um think about um sending it over radio waves or bluetooth
okay
okay
that might be a little bit uh expensive
um
and something like an l. c. d. screen
for what purpose
um uh like i said here um
maybe it's easy
it's nice as an added feature feature that um
when you're on a certain channel you can see on the l. c. d. screen uh what programmes are coming up or
okay
so it be uh a multi purpose uh very technically uh high uh
from my point of view yeah
remote
yeah it must be really uh innovative technical wise
yeah it has to be uh
yeah our company is very uh
good in making new innovative uh things
yeah
so yeah i i agree with you
we
so i i i i
so we must focus on things who are really uh really add something to uh to
to the current market
yeah
look you got some cheap uh remote controls there
they just uh
yeah you got a dozen of 'em
no
but when you enter a new market with a remote control and
mm-hmm
uh wanna gain market share
yeah
you have to do something special i think
yeah
but we have to keep an eye that it's uh at the beginning of such a project
it's it's it's very uh cool to talk about well this would be cool that would be cool
yeah
uh but we must not uh lose uh sight of the the user uh uh friendly uh
yeah of course
and and the price
but it's but but this is just from marketing uh aspect
yeah okay
yeah
i don't know anything about user interface or design
okay
okay
and that's because we have him
and and him
and him
okay uh next meeting will start in thirty minutes
so uh you uh will have uh individual actions where i presume uh will be some feedback uh via the m the mail
um the the the industrial uh designer has to uh look at the working design
uh the user interface designer has to look at the technical functions
so that's the thing we uh discussed
yeah
um one thing uh we must first agree on uh what we're going to m going to make
yeah
do we are we going to use um it it for multiple systems
or uh we should have some agreement on that before we
okay
um wha
mm uh i i don't think we have to be we have to agree on that
uh
i figure we could get back to it on the next meeting actually
i think th that's a pha yeah
that's a phase further
okay
yeah
ju just uh
make some mock ups some some general ideas
ah okay
and and then we can plan
yeah
yeah
we can plan further i think
yeah
but maybe because uh you are working on the user requirements you are working on the technical functions
we uh must uh have a little or kinda uh uh uh how do you call it
consensus on the what we're gonna do
uh
uh a little plan on on what we're going to do
so you don't uh uh come up with the user requirements who don't fit the the the the technical functions at all
some basic things we co we want to going to do
uh i think that's well uh yeah
will come in handy
mm yeah
i don't know
yeah
you decide
okay
you're the project manager
w he says
well yeah if the technical functions have to be designed i i've gotta know for what kind of machines they will be
yeah
or do we use it a text screen
or uh will it be with uh with bluetooth or
well th that's that's really a step further
but if you say uh is it uh uh one way or multi purpose that's a
okay
mm-hmm
uh tha that's a same step further
yeah actually it is
why
yeah
why
then looking at individual components so that's actually a f step further
uh
yeah
yeah
like we all have a list of uh things that has to b that have to be in it or how it has to be like
and then in the next meeting we decide
yeah
yeah we can take it from there
w what it's gonna be
yeah i agree uh we can take it from there
okay
a
and then you s then you can delete uh
or edit
the o the obsolete uh details
okay
so uh each individually i individually uh must think on what's uh at uh his point of view is the most important
i think
yeah
and uh then we're going to fit uh all the pieces together the next meeting
yeah
i must finish off now so it's over
you uh will receive specific specific instructions uh by your personal coach
and i see you in uh thirty minutes
okay cheers
okay
thank you
sorry
be careful
damn
yes
success
yeah
no
come up
hello
hey guys
hi
hi
hi
i see my bunny is still standing
yeah
no one drawing it
it's too beautiful
yeah true
uh i figured uh that much
too wicked
mm
a minute please my uh laptop is uh oh there it is thank you
so welcome back
at the functional design meeting um
the plan is uh that uh each one of you
so not me but only you uh will uh present uh the the things you worked on uh the last uh half hour
i will uh take minutes and will put uh the minutes that i have uh at the end of the session in the shared folder
also the minutes of the previous session are also in the shared folder now so you can read that uh now or afterwards
um
uh i had an email from the from the management board uh i don't know if you a al also uh received it
but there were four points uh which uh i think are very important
first one is uh they think that uh teletext teletext becomes outdated uh and internet will be the the main uh focus
uh second one is also important uh because it's one of the discussion points of the previous session
uh the remote control shou should onl only be used for the television
so it uh not gonna it's not gonna be a multi purpose remote control so uh that's one thing to keep in mind
uh second and i think that's important for the marketing uh expert
uh the current uh customers uh are in the age group group of uh forty years and older
but with this uh new remote uh they uh will uh would like to reach uh a group uh younger than uh forty
uh and uh i think to keep in mind
but not really uh for now is that they uh want the the the slogan and the and the logo uh to uh to be recognised more in the remote
so we have uh forty minutes so i think uh not more than ten minutes uh uh per presentation uh each
and please uh use uh all the the the facilities so that you have either smartboards the the word files what you uh whatever you want
so uh
tim can you start
okay
yeah
'kay welcome
i have some uh new findings on uh marketing expert level
mm-hmm
which i will show you
the method i used was um giving orders to our usability lab uh to do a questionnaire
um one hundred respondents were involved
and my marketing uh department generated a report with a lot of results
um
these were a couple of findings first page of three
um
we have three audiences of two audiences i'm sorry
uh the first one this scale from sixteen to forty five age
uh the second one is from sixty four uh forty six to sixty five
um as you can see here the market share for the first audience is about sixty percent um sixty five
uh second audience audience is uh thirty five percent
mm and some interests from the from the age groups
uh it seems like the young users of remote controls really like the fancy uh new technology stuff like uh an l. c. d. screen on the remote control um
speech recognition
i don't think that's uh really appropriate
um and when you see uh the audience
the age is going up uh
yeah they don't really want it anymore at least the new technologies
second findings out of the questionnaire um are the opinion
the opinions uh of the audience about current remote controls
first point is seventy five percent of the users find the most repo remote controls very ugly
uh and eighty percent of the users would spend more money when a remote control would look fancy
so that's maybe something for the user interface uh designer
okay third findings
according to the frequency of use versus importance investigation um following buttons are most important
um i will tell something about the way this uh this test was yeah done
um persons were asked
uh what the buttons were uh they use most how much an hour and uh in the second table the importance of those buttons
mm-hmm
um when you multiply them you get the these three points
switching channels um yeah
that's pretty uh
pretty normal that's what you do with a remote control
um the second teletext uh and the third uh volume controls
um i think it's good uh that we know what the user want wants uh at least the these three points have to be uh very clear
but it's strange that the the manage board the management board said that the teletext will be uh outdated by the internet
yeah okay
so that that's strange
yeah okay but uh at the moment uh teletext is
yeah th the best thing you can get uh on t. v. like getting information
yeah okay
so uh when you ask people what do they use
yeah
they use teletext and not the internet on a remote control
okay
yeah okay
that's ridiculous
yeah
that's a ne i it it's a new technology but it's not incorporated right now
yeah
okay my personal preferences
um
i think we should aim at the uh audience from sixteen to forty five
mm first of all um it's the biggest share the biggest audience sixty five percent
uh second i think you will get the most revenue from i from it
um
yeah people from sixteen to forty five watch a lot of t. v. more than uh people who are el uh elder
um second point we have to impro improve the most used functions as i said here switching channels teletext and volume controls
third point um that came out of the uh of the questionnaire uh people used to uh
get lost off the remote controller so maybe it's an idea for us uh to design ex kind of placeholder uh on side of the
yeah that's a cool idea
yeah of the t. v. where you can put the the remote control in
um
that's about it i think
yeah
when you mentioned uh improving functions what uh what do you mean by that what what are you think about
uh not not the r not the functions but uh it came out that a lot of buttons weren't even used uh on a remote control
uh the funtionability
so you can have a remote control full of buttons a hundreds hundreds of buttons but if you don't use them yeah it's
yeah
ah okay so focusing more on the used buttons
yeah they have to be on it j just to t to get it done if necessary
yeah
but um the most used buttons uh have to be bigger or
could you use perhaps uh one button for multiple functions like example pressing it in longer makes it switch to an different function for example
yeah perhaps
just for the minor functions perhaps
thank you
yeah ma perhaps just just an idea
just to get less buttons on the remote control to make it easier and quicker to learn
yeah
yeah
'kay that's it
thank you tim
janus can you uh
uh yeah yeah i'll go sure
right uh i'll be uh explaining a bit about uh working design about uh the project
well uh what i did was i dissected uh uh current remote controls and um i viewed how how they w looked
how they worked uh what kind of components are involved and how they are connected together
and uh after that i put up a scheme about how uh these things are organised and i'll show it to you in in a in a few seconds
and i'll explain a bit about uh how it works and how we could uh build one and why i think several possibilities uh that we discussed in the earlier meeting falls off
um right
uh well what i did was uh i i checked uh remote controls and the uh remote controls of today are all infrared not like all probably know
and the thing about that is um the remote controls uh have to act as a t. v. or uh a stereo or something
and those uh have a transmitter that's also focused on infrared
so if we want to uh build uh mm a remote control uh with bluetooth for instance then uh the t. v. should have bluetooth too in order to communicate
so that would mean extra cost for the user and thus uh that's that wouldn't mean a a cheap uh remote control for us
so that's probably why most controls are still infrared
furthermore they all have uh a a very simple structure
so that would probably uh mean lower costs and uh i that could mean for us a good thing uh 'cause uh well we we should be able to build a relatively cheap uh a cheap uh remote
well uh as i mentioned ready we have some bluetooth well it may be possible but uh i figured it wouldn't be possible in within our budget
but that's not for me to decide but that's maybe something for marketing to look into
f because uh well my personal opinion is uh is not to do uh bluetooth or or radio waves although
what do you think about uh incorporating bluetooth or a radio uh receiver uh in the place holder next to the t. v. connected to the t. v.
yeah actually i have t
so it's in the wrong product
yeah
yeah i actually i figured that would be that would be rather nice but then you'd still have the uh the infrared function
so in in theory you'd actually just move the problem
yeah
yeah
but uh what i did uh think about was when you mentioned about the uh the cup holder
is why not uh introduce a speech function like where is the remote
if somebody says where is the remote then it goes uh beep uh beep beep beep or something i dunno
yeah
maybe uh maybe something to look into i dunno uh what the cost that something like that would be
but it may be uh may be something to explore
uh i'll i'll just explain a bit of the components
uh first you have the energy source
the energy source would be a battery simple uh battery uh that you can find anywhere
i figured that would be best 'cause when the battery uh stops functioning uh we could just uh use you could just go out and buy a new one
so we didn't and we don't have to do all uh to be too complicated about that
uh the energy source is connected to the infrared button
but uh the infrared button uh works only via the chip and the subcomponent to uh the switch there is a switch uh between these
when the switch is pressed in a w on this this case it switches a button
when a button is prush pushed in uh a electric current goes through here
and in uh immediately a l a bulb lights up uh displaying to the user that something has happened
that's uh that's so the h user won't be um thinking well uh did the button be pressed w what happened uh
or i press button but nothing's happening on the t. v. so is is something wrong or something
so that's just to uh to to explain the of to to uh make it clearer to the user
uh w well the signal goes via chip that's translated into uh electric sig uh electronic signals and then it's processed and then it's sent to the infrared bulb where it will be uh uh received on the receiving end
and those uh interpreted by the device well in this case the television
uh well my personal preferences here well we have to keep it simple
not too many uh gadgets and functions
just like you said uh well the most users n uh you have a lot of buttons and you u u use you don't use them
so why why should we invent uh w spend more time on those
uh i i think we should stick by with infrared transmitting and uh no receiving
so uh no input from the television
so i think we shouldn't be uh spending time on um teletext and st things like that
because when you uh want teletext on uh infrared you'd have to build in a receiver too
and so in order to receive the signals from uh what's on t. v. and such
so i figure that would be uh spending too much money and time and
um
yeah maybe another problem uh
i think current t. v. s can even send infrared
yes but what should we uh s i i i f i agree with you
but should we spend money or and time on building a receiver into the uh remote control
huh
mm-hmm
'cause that would be i mean extra components extra designs um larger g uh remote control
yeah
yeah
these all uh all stuff that we have to take in account
so i i my personal opinion is no no no receiver at all
um well we should uh look into the design and the functionability
yeah
like i said uh use one button for instance for m multiple functions
or well uh just hide the few buttons o of switching it open or something the usual uh stuff
and uh don't overbuild we shouldn't make a big uh remote control for simple functions but we we should stick to the basics
so that was my uh my personal opinion
and that was my uh my presentation uh
okay
okay thank you janus
yes i can go ahead
you do
the last presentation
last presentation
you have plenty of time tim and uh janus don't uh talk to ten minutes so uh take your time
okay
if you take your time too long i will uh eventually uh
warn you
well i'm going to give a presentation abut some of the technical functions of these design and uh usability functions
um what's my opinion about what's most important to combine the design
technical possibilities and the user friendliness in one so if you um going to design a remote that looks good
that shouldn't weigh over the uh if it's possible to make of course but also the user friendliness so tha that's that's some of the main points
and another one is um the use um of many functions will will make it more difficult
so use as as little functions as possible or at least don't display them all at once on the same remote
if you have fifty functions you don't want fifty buttons uh t uh to be shown at the same time
hmm
'cause when you visit an internet uh site you don't want fifty links uh to see but maybe use a hierarch hierarchy uh structure
and uh well one of the ideas was maybe uh use touch screen but s i don't know in how far that is possible
hmm
since we are sticking to uh um infrared and and the remote cannot receive anything but uh we might uh consider that
um well of course i i hope this is all clear to you
if you you can use remote like this with all the functions
many functions but well your thumb is a little bigger than th it than this
you have to be very careful what you push
and um if you're looking for teletext you'll be uh searching for half an hour from uh um yeah well where is it
where the hell he here i guess and yeah when you have to uh use something else
so just keep it simple make clear buttons easy to use
for example if you want to use a play and back and stop
that's very important
um well this was because of our last discussion if multiple machines are used create easy switch between the machines but um it's no longer uh applying
well yeah i prefer to use it only for t. v.
and um
n uh not to give too many options and and if possible uh the buttons should give a dr direct action not first select
uh you you just said um uh you wanted to to combine more functions in one so uh you you want to keep it simple
yeah and so that's where the difficulties lie
yeah but
but i think that if you want to do that
then you can't escape the the fact that there will be buttons uh which give s uh more options than one
yeah this so that's the thing you have to weigh against each other
yeah
yeah but
do we want to use a few options and might not be so or original
mm-hmm
or uh multi purpose as we thought or do we want to use um many buttons
okay
yeah
so um weighing those factors
hmm it's maybe an option uh if you use an l. c. d. or a touch screen um
that in the middle are the the main keys like displayed on the
uh yeah
the doesn't
yeah this
no
yeah
something like that
okay just uh in the middle the general functions like play uh
channel switching and then uh at the top or at the bottom some menus like uh settings or that you can drop down
yeah
yeah but when all the questions i had do we want to use uh a menu display on the t. v.
or um does have to f everything uh be in remotes
'cause if you use a memory display on the t. v.
mm
you can simply push uh a more menu and then select the options you want to have and press okay
uh so that's my recommendation if you use many options in one buttle button
nah
mm-hmm
um display the menu on the t. v. and don't um use combination of t of two buttons at the same time or pressing buttons three times for five seconds
yeah
is too complicated for most users
yeah
i think so too but and that's partly because um uh a lot of t. v. s have different menus
yeah but
and when you have a particular menu uh at your device uh it could be that don't correspond to the menu what's actually on t. v.
yeah that will be a problem
yeah
well you d you have to keep in mind that uh several t. v. s uh don't even have a menu structure or they have a very simple menu structure
so you have to keep in mind that not all uh d not our remote won't be able to work on all televisions
yes
and that would be uh a considerable problem
so if we have to stick with current technologies and uh
um
well yeah the restrictions of what's uh is on the market today um you should keep it s at this
yeah
use big clear buttons
not too many
so maybe we'll loose a few option uh options but i think i this is more important
um
especially the important buttons um if you want to switch channel change your volume uh use teletext
it uh it has to work at once and more advanced options may be put it s somewhere away on the remote
not embed
behind uh a little uh little thing or a touch screen
yeah but then with something like a touch screen could could make more menu up pop up or something
and yeah if you want to uh uh s put on stand by or change the channel that should always be possible to do
not first change menu options or switch something
yeah
um well yeah as you already told give some feedback
yeah
if the user is pushing a button he should know if the television or n at least remote is reacting and not just that the batteries may be low
and um well my conclusion is uh is uh less is more keep it simple
so uh maybe we should just ease down on the functionality to uh to keep it accessible on t because you all know
if there are a lot of function on the the television some you you'll never know uh and never use
and therefore it's uh important if you want to change the volume or channel that is always accessible and easy and other functions um that are not so important um well you we should consider just not using them or at least putting them somewhere on the remote where they're not in the way for the for the most important functions
yeah
yeah
uh i think the idea uh about uh touch screen
um is very good
um
because recently uh i saw news item on t. v. um about
uh new telephones uh for elder people
um they have like a touch screen with uh really big pictures on it like uh uh call uh hang up um
and that's a big ad advantage i think because
one the one hand uh
you make the remote control compatible for elder users just by uh scaling up the pictures or something
mm-hmm
it's uh
very visual intended
what was i to say more
maybe that's an option
um keep the primary buttons visible
yeah
uh make a remote that fits easily in the hands and for some design issues uh well
put a logo on it and maybe use it uh in some aesthetic uh aesthetic form
but uh th the important buttons m make them always accessible and pushable and clear and maybe use a touch screen
or if that's uh will become too difficult just uh
like televi some o older telephones use a l uh maybe it's possible to to flip them open and uh just expand the number of options that are normally visible
yeah okay but but if you pick the the idea the left idea
um
yeah
then what's gonna be displayed on the touch screen
the extra functions
the extra functions you uh you just see a menu from system functions or teletext functions
yeah but l like menu functions or
yeah
and you just choose one and then all all the options will become available and you just c s yeah t scroll through them
ah okay
wouldn't it be better to make just one big touch screen
yeah i think so
uh one one small uh touch screen uh applet and uh i'll just make um uh let's say fifteen buttons on it
and uh we have three of those uh actually just uh menus with sub menus with or sub items sub functions
yeah
well um then i'd like to make a proposal
if you make one big touch screen
yes
use the same concept as here keep the buttons always available and use the lower part of the touch screen for the rest
yeah
yeah
yeah yeah like like the ipod idea that that we just saw
yeah
yeah
you just have a f a few selected buttons and uh a few menus
and with this idea you could actually make uh several you can also improve uh later on
yes
uh uh i think that will be great
okay
so you think it's will be better to have a t kinda total touch screen
yeah i think so
yeah i wou i would actually go for the
jirun
okay i agree but i think it's very important that they always um make the same buttons accessible
so use just for special options a part of the touch screen
yeah of course
yeah
yeah
and so um an elder designer picks up th the of an elder parents or grandparent picks up the remote from the little child and who's all in the systems functions
yeah yeah yeah
you'll have to have the possibility to turn off the t. v. or to switch the channel without um well using all the menu structures to get back to the primary functions
yeah
yeah i had another uh idea about maybe parental control
mm-hmm
um
like building in uh some kind of pin code uh which allows uh parents to switch to all channels
yeah
uh but children uh if children don't don't know the pin code they can't switch to uh violent uh channels or
yeah wh
is that possible to use or no
that is possible that well that actually depends on the television but i think i figure that would be
th there's just
well yeah well does it have to depend on the television
ju just a simple log in something like that
well y you s you see the fi uh thing is when you buy a remote you you set the uh channels
yeah
yeah
the the channels are different on each te television they aren't set in a preset order
yeah
so uh if you uh lock on a remote uh let's say channel fifteen
mm-hmm
well channel fifteen on this television is different than channel fifteen on the other television so that would be uh that would be actually the main concern
yeah okay
yeah
well i think that he means that um maybe by some option uh make sure that um remote control and the t. v. match
yeah
and then after that you can um use some s insert some passwords as being apparent that the children cannot use this uh change the settings of the t. v.
yeah
like colour and then volume and uh
yeah th that kind of stuff but maybe um if you log in first as a parent um
mm-hmm
you address the the channels and like uh oh that's channel fifteen that's uh
yes
vi violent channel uh m my ki my kids uh i don't want my kids to watch that then you set the priority to only parents
oh something like that
yes
yeah
yeah
okay yeah
well b but make it a separate option in the menu so that it's it's dif dis displayed from uh displayed here so uh parents uh
yeah that would b
for example
but
yeah that
yeah okay but but yeah that's just
that's an a an added feature
yeah
okay
but let's not uh go too wide about the those things that's that why we're here
yeah th th those things are nice
it's it's a nice idea but i think that's we wel later in the stage
i've one little question about um a total touch screen or uh um a p yeah a partial
partial
uh because i think uh elderly people may be uh not used to uh a touch screen
so they want the the the normal functions like teletext volume changing
um uh to be uh yeah kinda traditionals uh and uh the the the the other functions
yeah
the more difficult functions uh to be uh maybe on the touch screen but to keep this as uh normal as possible to keep it accessible
mm-hmm
yeah but but if you display it on l. c. d. screen with r r really big numbers
yeah you can de display it on the on the old style
that's just as e just as easy
uh
i i do
you can display actual buttons on the touch screens
yeah
yeah that's true that's true
uh i do agree because well it's just not the same when you touch a touch screen or when you touch a button
yeah
yeah okay
but well we have to look at what's our target uh audience
yeah it's different
w we are aiming for younger people and they they chose
yeah
yeah that's true yeah
yeah age b below forty
yeah yeah yeah yeah that's a good point
so that's that's probably uh a
yep
and th those young people yeah
y you saw it in my marketing report they like the new fancy stuff so
mm-hmm
they like the fancy stuff yeah
that's true
a touch screen like microsoft al already developed something like that for uh uh multi media applications
mm-hmm
mm
i th i think we can do that too
yeah
okay as you can see uh the minutes from the second meeting this one are uh are done
done
uh i've uh added the this uh four things from the management board just to keep in mind
mm-hmm
um each time i uh i had a sort of uh summary on what you told and uh what you personal think
uh so that can be uh can be read out
uh a f a few things i uh i noticed uh were um
moment
ooh
uh th the the main points in uh this uh uh in this uh meeting is i think uh how uh it's going to look uh with uh we must keep it simple
but have the opportunity to uh have more options and have them uh hidden or something
so they don't uh you don't have a big uh thing full of uh buttons or uh um and uh the point that uh you uh wanna use one uh controller uh for uh uh hypothetically each television
so you must uh the the the the functions know
like the menus or the the parental control must be all uh by the done by the remote control and not by the television
i think that's the point what uh
mm-hmm
yes
we discussed
yeah yeah some of them
the menus uh are not identical for all th for all t. v. s so you have to display it on one uh t. v.
well you can use um when you uh how do you call it s um synchronized the um remote and the t. v. then there's always
yeah but that's not possible
there are always uh possibilities to change the colour and the brightness and the volume and um well maybe we can look out if there's options that the remote um in its memory can see what kinda t. v. it is
mm-hmm mm yeah
from ah it's a philips this and this and that and then give the options that are capable the capable from the t
yeah but you have uh uh an yeah but you have an international market range so you have i think a big range of
add th that that's an opportunity
well there are universal d um um remotes and they all have a functionality for all the t. v. s
yeah
uh so this wouldn't be a extra feature to incorporate the men menus of these
yeah
okay
but they
but
and it's not too complex to do it
well they uh they all have to be programmed to fit your t. v. and that that is bit of a tricky job
no
yeah
yeah
i actually use one of those when they are they are kinda kinda troublesome
but but the thing is whe when you uh start uh building something like this you have to build a receiver into the uh t into the remotes
because uh in order for the remote to process something from the t. v. like uh to synchronise and you have to send and receive and that's well
yeah
well
yeah
mm-hmm
oh um mo no you can just say uh the c
no no no
he he he he me he means just just one other thing
just build it in
yeah
uh with the current remote controls the universal ones um you have to press yeah you have to press a code for t. v.
yeah
yes
in codes y you you get a b a book with codes
you look up
i have a philips h. fifty five and it says press code four five five and you press code four five five on the uh in the remote and it displays all your uh menu options
yeah
yeah
oh okay yeah sure uh
yeah yeah yeah
oh yeah yeah sure that would be possible yeah
yeah
now we uh just connect uh the t. v. type uh to a set of options in just just in the memory
memory in the in the remote
yep
profiles
so that if you yeah like profile so that if you uh touch in like uh one four one zero kind of t. v. uh
yeah
the memory uh
pops up the options
yeah
yeah that would be possible
okay
yeah sure
i th don't think that's uh that takes a lot of storage space or some just varia variables
no that wouldn't be uh
yeah a few variables
yeah well um if you look at the um manuals from universal uh remotes there are maybe um three four hundreds t. v. s at maximum
mm-hmm
yeah
yeah
if you have all of them all the old and new t. v. s summed up so uh i think uh it is possible
ah it is
it is definitely po
but on the other hand on the other hand uh if you have a remote and buy a new t. v. that isn't incorporated in the remote
we have five minutes to go
yeah
well then you have to buy a new one it's very good for marketing
new remote
maybe or an update software update
a firmware upgrade or something but from where
firmware update you say
yeah firmware upgrade
ah
maybe w
that's maybe the cup holder
no m may no maybe we can incorporate some kind of uh u. s. b. or a firewire connection
yeah
yeah
so that you can uh connect it to the p. c. and download the newest firmware from uh from the internet
well not everybody has uh has uh a p. c. at home
well the most most people have but not not everybody and
well at uh you can go back to the shop and uh they
yeah like a s kind of service centre
yeah
yeah ser o and they can download it for you
yeah maybe something like service cen or you could well you could s actually look at the place holder you talked about earlier
yeah
and you could probably uh make a connection to uh an telephone line or a internet connection
mm-hmm
yeah
well already digital information is sent t to the the standards t. v. uh connections
yeah
you can see what's uh programme is on on the new uh channels so maybe j they we can send that information along with standard t. v. uh
well then then it's be uh back to the building a receiving uh well uh if it's actually worth it to build it in
receiving
oh yeah
yeah
we could actually look at into it but i dunno it it would be uh bringing more costs uh with with it and
yeah
difficult
yeah
i i think it's uh
most cheap or cheapest to just do the updates uh at the service centre or at the shop
yeah that would be probably best yeah
yeah yeah uh s i think some i think it's good idea yeah
yeah
like when you when you buy a t. v. you just ask well i'll
it's it's it's not a lot of work just one uh docking station where you put it in press start bling bling updated
yeah
yeah that would be best yeah
yeah
yeah
yeah
you don't buy a t. v. every week new teev so
okay let's uh save this in the meanwhile uh
no no
exactly so
um m for which one are we going
my mistake
let's vote
that one or uh
yeah my vote goes out to the right
your vote and your okay
my vote too
yeah
and your vote
well i was uh doubting about which one to take
but uh you've convinced me that uh if you di display buttons about the same as they would look on a normal um remote all elderly people will know what to do
yeah
yeah
and also like a clapping uh
li like device that uh pops open
opens up is too difficult or uh
flips open
uh too difficult um maybe uh it's easier to break it
n yeah
break it i don't get
yeah th th th that i uh
yeah
it's very sensitive
oh so yeah
like my telephone it's uh it's sensitive too
yeah
yeah
okay well uh it's almost at the end
so we have now a lunch break finally yeah
ah
uh after the lunch break uh it's back to uh individual work once again uh thirty minutes
uh i will put my minutes uh i have updated them so uh s they're updated in the shared folder too
thirty minutes
thirty minutes the
how minutes
failure
uh uh the specifi uh specific instructions for the next uh meeting you will all will receive uh at the uh the the email
i don't think i can uh say much about it
so uh uh wait for your email and uh hopefully you get it done uh in the in the thirty minutes
and i w will see you after the lunch break and the thirty minutes
one question uh how late do we have to get back be back here
yeah
uh well uh thirty minutes
a quarter to one maybe
uh yeah
thirty minutes lunch break
thirty minutes lunch break yeah
okay
i thought forty five
oh
forty five
yeah
uh then would it be uh one o'clock
yeah
or we we ask our personal coach
okay
yeah
okay
thank you
thank you uh that was a very uh good session i think we uh we
yeah is it possible to store this on the share documents or what
yeah me too
uh ye well
save as
yeah because uh all uh things are uh stored in smart board dot uh x. d. k. and that's in
yeah v
but but you can open a from your pr from your laptop
'kay save it as an image on the res
yeah maybe
save as
export
no
no
maybe not export function
export
well i can i can uh
export h. t. m. l.
no and use an image if possible
huh image
j. peg
g. yeah j. peg
j. peg
yeah it's better
paper size a. four
uh screen size
in this directory
yeah
n oh
oh yeah it's not connected to the
you all uh have the the questionnaire again about uh the after work
to our p. c. s
no
yeah it is connected
it's connected
yeah i think so
to room
deskt huh
no
i'll just uh saved in my documents
oh
yeah in my own uh in my own messenger
yeah
project documents yeah
yeah
it gives the na oh
yes
okay nice
okay thank you
the questionnaire fill in uh we fill out d after lunch or uh
uh well it's it's simply filling oh no it's uh it's also filling out no i'd do it after lunch i think
okay
aye cheers
i'm hungry so do it after lunch
yes
thank you all
thank you
you're welcome
we can leave the p. c. on i think yeah and return to the
yeah of course
yeah
well i bring it to my uh personal room
yeah bring to i gotta bring it home
to my exave executive
my executive uh big room with the with the panting
a big office
yes
aye
yeah
okay
hello again
hi
hello
hey project manager
um project manager i have something to tell you
mm yeah
i have a little problems with my laptop
okay
and uh s s s so i had a little less time to complete
okay
no a little problem uh big problem
i just thought um it didn't work anymore
what was it problem
the laptop
the entire windows uh
it hang hung
it it hung
ha ha
oh
project manager
yes
you're our project manager
yes
your project manager
welcome to the conceptual design meeting
for real reaction
uh hello again
uh it's uh the same as the last time
uh uh also this time there will be uh three presentations
and we um must uh reach a decision on uh the remote control concepts
um uh and at the end uh i uh when i finish it off i have some uh input from uh a master class i uh visited
information
during lunch yeah
master
he's the master yeah
master of
the the the the the concepts on uh we uh where we uh must reach a decision on
um uh our from uh are of two sorts
components concepts and user interface concepts
uh the first one is uh really about the the the the the total package uh with uh well
we have decided to do a do the uh with a touch screen that must be a case around it so uh it won't be uh uh as breakable
uh how how about the energy
can you uh can you reload it or uh just have batteries which you must exchange
uh the user interface concept
uh with the type and uh the the supplements
so uh where to put what button
and uh uh i would say uh jans can you begin
yeah sure
okay
at the end uh i will take notes uh and at the end of the minutes uh will uh be at the shared folder
okay
uh let me see
i think it's this one
ha
wow
right
uh well i'll be talking about the components
uh what i did was i reviewed previously used items uh by uh two two uh different uh age groups
mm-hmm
uh below forty five and above
and uh i just uh watch what the differences are and i checked uh well what what d do we want
and how can we uh d aim a at uh the target group
well uh what i found was that a senior um
i'm sorry
senior citizens uh
ye ah it's it's okay
okay
go on
uh they well they like more the they like the traditional materials like wood and and such more
wood and chrome
and uh uh they like uh straightforward shapes
um uh they they they they like luxurious uh styles where whereas the young and dynamic they like a more uh soft materials
think of the teletubbies for instance
uh uh soft and fluffy and colourful and well uh shapes are curved and round
y y you get the picture
and uh they like sports and gaming and that gives them uh the vitality
uh so w well uh firs yes
one one little question
um about the the material
yeah
uh a soft material for a remote control
no i'll i'll get to that
okay
you you'll see
yeah
yeah
thank you
uh well f first off let's start start with the energy
w i uh i had a choice between uh a few different uh sources
mm-hmm
but uh the two basic sources that i found were the best possible were the battery uh versus kinetic
uh kinetic that's when you move something then uh it gets energy
i figured well that's ki kinda high tech when when you have a remote control that well when you pick it up it has power
that would be actually very nice uh i figured
oh
well we could also use a battery that's a bit
yeah but when the power gets low you have to shake it or something
yeah
yeah yeah you c just you have to shake it around a little bit
uh and uh uh
and then then it d then it has some more uh energy
well y you could just go for a battery
hmm
or you can go for both
oh have you considered the option of using a solar panel
yeah i actually did
but uh the thing is about solar panel is you have to have l uh light
well sunlight preferably
w nah
uh and you you could you could use normal light but uh you wouldn't get the same amount of energy that you would from a battery or something
mm
yeah
uh for uh ultimate b uh n uh use of uh solar panels you could actually use uh you could use uh solar panels
but uh you ha you'd have to implement them into uh the remote control leaving you uh a bit less space for the interface
mm yeah
yeah
it's too less space
so uh so i i it it wo what's actually i i c just in f i've figured it out that well
uh seeing that you'll always be uh within the l uh distance of t. v. and the from t. v. there comes a a a whole bunch of light
so it would actually power itself uh from a t. v.
yeah
but well you just take up all the space and you wouldn't uh have the full amount of power actually used
okay
but you prefer kinetic
so i i prefer kinetic because it's uh well the costs aren't that much higher
okay
and um ju just a bit more high tech than than a normal battery
i mean if
yeah but you don't move a a remote control too much
no but uh d well you pick it up and you press buttons and y well you
and that's enough to to keep the energy level uh
yeah well uh actually it is
okay
and it it if it isn't you just shake it a bit and and add add with power up again
yeah
but what l what jarek said you could you could use a battery that you'd just keep it on the recharging whenever it moves
and for rest you'd just add juice on the battery
okay
and when the battery doesn't work i usually shake it too
so like slamming on it
exactly
thank you tim
it's exactly the same
and so that uh uh well f furthermore you you we uh checked uh the cases
we have uh different options uh concerning the cases
you ha i you sim uh you simply add a basic uh standard uh model uh it was kind of square and uh i figured that's a bit boring
so you you we could go for uh the single curved or the double curved
um single curve it's just a well uh you know it's just uh a nice curve
or but but you could go in a in an double curves
and that's like several different dimensions
that gives you an whole new uh effec
yeah
dynamic dynamic look
hmm
yeah that gives you a younger and uh more high tech look i f i figured
but that uh we'll discuss later
but are you going to draw it
what
the yeah
you want me to draw in three d.
th th yeah
yeah
yeah
uh i c i can't imagine
uh yeah i ca i ca i could i could show you
i can't imagine how how how it looks like
i could show you
well uh let's say y uh you uh
yeah
let's say that's your standard uh
design
yeah
that's a bit your d standard design
mm-hmm
but you could actually go like uh something like this
and then uh in three d. effect you could go
um
uh
so y you you just
yeah this is a this bit uh difficulty in i didn't take a major in art
so but but you could have uh uh a whole new uh the back back the the the depth
oh okay
you could you could uh just play around a bit with
okay
you you don't have to use standard uh
oh okay
a little artistic
yeah you could y it leaves more space for creativity
okay
okay
uh that might be an idea but just a well furthermore uh well uh plastic versus rubber
you we could choose uh what uh what's better plastic um or rubber
i i ch prefer rubber because it feels uh yeah
it's soft
yeah it's soft and it's that i like soft
that's the material the younger people want uh ain't it
yeah yeah i mean uh plastic uh is plastic also has that cheap feeling to it
like plastic uh your your i usually associate plastic with uh something that's cheap
uh that's maybe just me but uh we could uh
uh oh talk about it later
uh furthermore buttons
uh traditional uh or a touch screen
well we discussed it in a previous meeting so i figured i'll just leave it at the l. c. d.
and uh chip set well uh if we are going to use traditional buttons we could go uh with a simple chip set
but uh if we decide to go on a n uh um l. c. d. screen we would use an uh we have to use an a advanced chip set
and that would bring uh the necessary costs with with it
so that's something we th have to keep in mind
if it isn't uh manageable uh budget wise we'd have to go over to uh to sim to simple buttons
well i think uh we're going to sell tell ten millions of them
so uh i bet a big company in uh korea or taiwan like uh samsung can give us uh a big discount on the chips so
yeah
yeah
yeah probably
u usually chips are uh aren't more expensive than one dollar
yeah probably but but uh yeah that's that's that shouldn't shouldn't be uh that big a issue
so
that that shouldn't be a real issue i think
i'll i'll i'll just add uh uh i put a big summary here so we could discuss it a bit
uh what i what are your ideas concerning battery versus kinetic
um i think you should use kinetic as a back up
yeah you you you should we should a combination
yeah a combination
a combination yeah
uh you use the battery and w charge it up with kinetic
when you pick it up it charges up
yeah
like an uh aku uh
yeah
acu uh yeah
yeah yeah i know
okay
yeah
just like the watch from seiko
well
yeah
psycho kinetic
yeah i con exactly
yeah
yeah
what uh what do you think
you agree
i i uh i would prefer uh both uh too
yeah
both
combine them
yeah
combine them
okay
uh well that would bring the m m some more costs but i mean the
okay
who cares right
that's the project manager's problem
buy a fifty cents battery and uh
of course
fifty cent
yeah well fifty cent uh uh why doesn't and then we have single curved versus double curved
that
well maybe i have something in my presentation to uh to cope with that
okay
no we'll we'll just wait and uh uh plastic versus rubber
rubber
any ideas
rubber
uh rubber
yeah
um isn't possible to make combination with kind of rubber is or bendable remotes where you've got a
you
or do you think it rubber casing yeah
uh i figured it will be m rather than hard nah rubber c uh this is a casing yeah
rather hard
rubber casing because well if you use an uh d a touch screen uh it's just a casing uh around it
so um you could go for plastic but i figured
yeah
yeah
um well d maybe i can ask it right now the question that i have
i i i would choose rubber
uh is it possible uh of is it necessary to make a touch screen square
it isn't i think yeah
well m i don't know
well i think that touch screens are generally square
no
yeah
yeah
but it's the case you put around it that makes the shape
we're we put fashion in electronics so maybe we can uh
that isn't
hmm
yeah okay but if you have a square uh l. c. d. screen
mm yeah
and you put a case around it that has uh like bulbs or that that covers part of the l. c. d. screen
mm-hmm
yeah that would cover it
that
that that would solve the problem
that's it's custom customisable and
oh yeah
okay i i get it
mm yeah
so mm uh uh so uh so what are the opinions
uh rubber or plastic
i i i prefer rubber
yeah me too
me too
okay
yeah you too
yeah
you sure
you you you seemed to hesitate a bit
that's good
well as long a as long as it's it's uh it's firm
and you don't uh it's not bendable or something i th i think that goes too far
mm yeah
yeah it it shouldn't it shouldn't flop over when you hold it in your hand uh no
okay
oh
that that that that's gonna the the chip set will hold it firm in place and uh and and uh and a l. c. d. screen also
okay
it might even bounce back when you drop it on the floor
yeah it m might it might
okay
uh tra uh traditional versus l. c. d. well i figured we we all set on that
and uh then also the simple versus advanced
well i figure if we go for l. l. c. d. we we should have the advanced
mm yeah
yeah
so that shouldn't be a problem
okay well that's my uh
thank you
uh you're welcome
can i uh do my thing
yeah
it uh
do your thing tim
do your thing
bring it on
expert map
okay uh
last week
i went to uh paris and milan for some trend watching
for marketing
our research and development department and i went to paris and milan
in paris and milan we uh asked different people uh differing in age and in income
uh the amount of money to spend um what they like in design uh and material nowadays
findings
our main audience uh so that's people below forty uh prefer the following
at first the colours of fruit
very basic colours like janus explained
um fresh colours uh green red uh strawberry red uh yellow banana yellow
um considering material um
yeah
they like spongy material like yeah a sponge ball
spongeball
like a s soft material
janus m uh mentioned it also
yeah
i think he did some uh
some findings himself
well the teletubbies sh
you wer you weren't in paris
okay
like this
like big uh g flashy colours
flashy
yeah
fresh
it's nice i think
okay our secondary audience uh people above forty a forty years in age they like the dark traditional colours
uh
yeah uh materials like wood that
yeah but wood is not a not a material you which you build a a remote control of
well you could
no n j just j just a w
you you could
yeah but never seen one
it'll float
well uh
no okay but just just a wooden uh look
case
oh a wooden look yeah
yeah
like uh you have those fake uh fake panels on the floor
tables
okay
the that isn't wood anyway but okay
but that's our secondary audience
yeah
so uh we decided to take
mm yeah the people below forty
yeah
so that this doesn't apply
'kay the third
uh there're some overall thoughts about new remote controls
they have to look fancy
um they should be technological in innovative
that means uh there have to be fancy things in
uh and easy to use
but that's common
my personal preferences
we have to aim at a mu at the main audience
and uh therefore use fresh colours
would you prefer uh uh that you can choose the colour of your uh remote control or
uh i'll i'll come to that in a second point
okay
here think about removable covers as seen in mobile telephon telephone market
okay
to customise your own remote control
like the nokia uh the removable covers uh just put a red on it and go to the shop and buy a green one
yeah
okay
uh a third material being used uh could well be stuff like rubber
um two advantages
uh it fits within the current market trends
and uh it adds safety to your remote uh when you drop it
so
uh to come back to your question i think uh and the people in milan and paris also think that uh the rubber should be pretty hard
like uh
seen on regular mobile phones
actually they have a lot in common
the phones and the
well i actually saw a phone that you could use as a remote so yeah
yeah
ah
yeah
maybe you could use your remote as a phone
okay
hey
hey
that might be a next step
there are numbers on it so uh
yeah exactly
uh in my second sheet of personal preferences uh we have to reconsider the speech function uh recognition
uh it's very innovative
innovative
so that you say um s. p. s. s. and it goes to uh okay
yeah like something
you you can see that the market is just screaming for new technologies like speak uh speech recognition and stuff
but we have to keep the cost in uh in mind but it
twelve fifty uh
yeah it it can be uh very expensive
'kay second
uh building games like snake or tetris to amuse the younger users
uh also the link with uh mobile phones
yeah but you don't use that th games when you watching television i think
uh
no but no okay
well yeah
but you don't use games when you're d when you're making a telephone call
it's just the same
when your parents are watching some boring program you can take the remote and do something else
yeah
yeah okay
when you're at college
take it
you take your uh remote with you to school
uh no
you take your remote control with you
you al you also take uh t you take your ipac and go uh play games
yeah
yeah
yeah
well i do that but okay and um
and third i stick with it the log in functionality uh with the slogan take parental control to a new dimension
very nice
ooh
that's it
s
uh great
mm-hmm
in
okay
um the interface contents
well that's a just simple powerpoint mock up i want to m make it more as dynamic for you so i'll draw there
but the main concept is um take one big touch screen
um always display the primary buttons clear and visible
maybe even li like this with uh u uses of a lot of space
and uh make the menu structure changeable
so if you press um system that's yeah well m multiple system options can maybe five or ten or or one can fit in
or maybe even a step further when you want to um
t um have some other options that are not programmable with one horizontal button
and um other buttons can may be displayed here if that's necessary
and um well how do uh do we want to look at uh uh f um yeah does a remote look well
it's you've gotta hold it in one hand
so um the middle like all remotes have to be in a little bit small so you can put it in
inside your hands
and some remotes you can use with your thumb
but i think that's too difficult for this one
so you can make it s a little broader
yeah
and here
and maybe use your thumb
on the on the main buttons
and use your other hands
on the menu structure
so here are gonna be the program buttons
one two three four et cetera
and the the volume control and program control maybe
and down here
um i added this could be one uh big l. c. d.
um the menu structure
so you can use it in uh in this way
um
one thing you've gotta keep in mind keep the remote clear of too much functions at the same time
um know that if you are changing the menu structure here um
and well i still believe you should keep displaying the buttons
but if you're programming the colour of the t. v. do not display twenty other options that are possible
just keep it as simple as uh as possible
and do not use too many levels
do not have to select a screen first and then brightness and then colour and un plus and um push plus twenty times
but just the um uh just in one button if possible
and um well you kn you all know the t. v. levels
um channel one two
and when you get to n to uh to ten ye and want to go back uh well you have a problem
just m most most modern t. v. s you you press one zero and it goes to ten
and else to one and through after that
so the s a button less
and um things like teletext put them in the menu
things like um um
yeah
yeah
uh what do you think about a back and forth come up uh button
yeah yeah w yeah i i find i must trying to uh tell it
l like in uh internet explorer
is uh volume plus and minus
and this is program uh plus
and minus
uh
yeah okay but does it that is for uh going from four to five
yes
but if you go from two to eight and you want
or if you're watching studio sports on uh on seventeen and your wife is watching some soap on two well yes i think that's a good idea
yeah and on two
that you can switch switch easy
but um well m my preference would to be put it in the menu structure
yeah it is
yeah
and if you're using that button a lot of times well of course the menu will still be displayed on the screen
you just don't have to play games uh in between
but if you're really switching between two channels you won't have time uh to d use the other options
mm no
um yeah already already told that
that's it
yeah
that's my conclusion
okay
oh okay
uh
i think we can discuss a little about the the three uh kind of revolutionary things uh tim uh came with
the parental control the games and the voice recognition
uh
there's n not uh too much decision on uh that one so uh i think that parental control is a good function to uh to put in the remote
i don't know how you think about it
yeah
well i agree just put it in the menu structure somewhere
yeah
um yeah um system properties um parental control
yeah but
what i see uh how i see it is you put it on the the remote and then you have like a windows log on screen with parents children
yeah
mm
something like that
yeah
um w well yeah
and w when you want to use the parents uh option you have to
it it has to be fast
you don't want to to go down and watch the news at eight o'clock and turn it on and wait twenty seconds for for uh the log on screen and then remember your code and all kinds of settings
yeah ok
no but i think most people uh find it uh much more important that their children don't watch uh sex or violence uh on the television
mm-hmm
and uh wait uh ten or fifteen seconds longer so they can uh finally watch it uh because of that
why
mm-hmm
you c may use like when there's uh x. p. uh a simple log on d you just push uh one or two or three
uh
yeah
yeah
yeah
yeah
pu push parents
and if you push parents then yeah
that then then then you have to uh go to three digit uh log in
to log in
yeah
and if you puts a ye
like two one three
uh-huh
yeah
and it's in
and if you w you push p children uh you don't have to uh log in but you can only watch uh children's channels or uh okay
it automatically goes yeah
yeah
yeah
well
i don't know if it's worth uh the time and effort we are going to spend on it
because well it's a simple function but it's gonna take a lot of resources and a lot of time um to programming it
because you'll have to start working with the profiles and such
mm-hmm
and i'm not sure if it's actually worth uh investing that much time and effort into it
i don't know what
well i think that's a b there's a big market for it because uh you yeah
mm yeah
you read many times in magazines same kind of stuff and you heard on the news that uh that he yeah
v violent t. v.
they believe that children uh are influenced by the television and uh well we're we're aiming uh to uh below uh forty uh years
but there are a lot of uh people will below forty who have uh children in young age uh who who want um to uh not watch uh violent or uh
yeah
well maybe um some idea on that
yeah
just make through a remote as it is but make an option to insert profiles
yeah
'cause if my grandad would buy this remote he wouldn't want to bother with all all the all the uh things to do
yeah of course
yeah
just make it an option in menu ins install powerful profiles or something
yeah yeah
yeah
that's a that's a better idea
yeah w it just has to be w when it's deliver out of the store it has to be just simple and plain
yeah
but if you want to install it personally uh
yeah okay
if i got kids and i could choose between uh two remote controls
one uh w with parent control and one without and i would would buy the one with
yeah with and one without
yeah
um b well still some question i have about how to incorporate those ones
i th yeah
you're thinking about some channels they uh cannot see but well i i when i think oh yeah for the f for all the standard channels
and only for maybe after ten o'clock uh in the evening violent films and movies uh will come and uh maybe maybe some some timing uh will be uh needed instead of uh of channels
yeah
because if you're watching uh i don't know you're in the at day uh cartoons will come up m on maybe friday night
i don't know
yeah maybe it can work with show view
uh you you can control your video recorder with show view
uh when you tick in a number it will uh start and end uh recording
but maybe there's some option that uh that t uh the kind of show view numbers are violent and that they are blocked out
yeah the disadvantage vantage is that someone will has to send all the show view numbers of the programs that they remotes and edit it all
yeah
that's true
yeah
will have to decide uh
yeah but yeah but that isn't possible
that isn't possible
yeah
but well if you want to i i i if we in incorporate uh the parental control
uh let's say we do and and well whatever cho uh child just goes up to the t. v. and presses up for instance
yeah
well uh nob nobody's stopping the child from uh well checking uh the channel
hmm
well yeah you could say if parental control is only it it'll go from fourteen to sixteen with the page up then but
but that
well i'm not sure because um for that to happen you d you will have to receive a signal from the uh remote control
yeah
so it would yeah have to be constant uh constant signalling
mm-hmm
what m what may be better is to incorporate an uh a separate device that uh that you can program with the remote control
and that uh provides parental control for instance
and that's just an optional uh device
so there's n that's there's uh besides uh the remote control you'll have a separate uh
i wouldn't put it in an optional device
that that then then then it becomes too much i think
yeah
if we do it we we must do it in a kind of ways that like a profile
yeah and
a parent profile and a family profile and otherwise
yeah on a separate menu uh option
and and you know w uh when you install another device
uh children can still go up to the t. v. p pop open uh the thing and and and g
yeah
yeah that's true
go to a channel
that's true but uh at same instant same happens when uh you have remote control
yeah yeah of course
so
but
but only difference is uh the uh the people buying the remote control will now get the f added feature of parental control
and those people wouldn't uh necessary want it
yeah
ah it's yeah
so you you'd be
yeah okay
but it's just an an added feature feature
yeah
yeah
okay
and what do you uh guys think of the games in the voice recognition
i personally think that that becomes too much
yeah well yeah i
it's more like it gets you to the functionality but
a mail too from management that it's very popular to use voice recon recognition
yeah
but i don't think when you're watching t. v. uh hearing loud noises from the t. v. someone screaming one and you f the channel switches uh yeah
mm yeah
yeah
yeah
yeah like f voice recognition is too much i think
yeah
but games
okay
and games
it doesn't
yeah
i can see games happening
w you can put it on chip anyway so uh
yeah
yeah
that that doesn't c that doesn't co
as long as it's isn't a primary feature of the remote but uh
that would
yeah that that doesn't cost a lot of extra resources i think
okay
so that will uh that that that must be in it you think
yeah that will be nice
okay
so the games uh are in it
the voice recognition are not
and the parental control are
optional in
optional
yeah it's it's in it
but too ma i i think so but
but how we do it
yeah
well i think also it's a good idea buts very difficult to incorporate
so we should make it too complex
is t some menu uh function you choose parental control and maybe four files will emerge from menu where put it on
okay
yeah
but uh how how it's gonna work uh uh will f be a problem
yeah okay
uh but uh will there uh uh like the first idea uh from uh you can buy it without and uh with parental contr control
mm-hmm
or are we going to put it in and uh just uh
well
ye i i think best would be uh to put it in and make it an menu option
to put yeah to put it in always
you can put on yeah
yeah
and you can just uh s when you buy it you can select um personal preference parental control on and the password or something
mm yeah
well i don't know
i i figure if you had two different remotes you could bo choose one with uh well uh uh a receiver in it
so you could actually easily uh build in uh parental control
but it would would be uh more expensive
so a and that that way uh you could make cheap model and a expensive model
could ma make the uh simple model and the deluxe model uh for instance
oh it's a p yeah
yeah but t. v. s aren't capable of sending
yes they are
yeah
yeah
i thought they were just
yeah you yo yeah but most often not
yeah you you have some t. v. s any
a able to receive
yeah some
but
yeah
that is true that is true
well maybe you just have to restrict it to what programs where the parent says you cannot watch channel seven
nine and ten and you cannot watch all channels after ten o'clock
yeah
and there's just some little uh clock in the remote
well yeah you could you could easily you could easily you could easily to the mote control
yeah j just some rules
yeah
but you still have the problem about uh the television itself
no no it's very simple
there uh th i h i've seen some of remotes who have a clock in it
yeah yeah yeah
so the remote does doesn't transmit when it's after twelve clock
yeah okay
but on the t. v.
yeah
at least my t. v. is a is a compartment which you can press
and there are buttons uh behind it which you can use if you d if you don't if you don't have a
yeah
yeah
yeah
yeah
well that's to put it very blunt that's not our problem
just have um the parents buy uh some glue and uh it's not not a part of the remote
yeah
yeah
yeah of course
yeah that is true
yeah that is true
you have to f yeah
yeah you could you could you could go like uh that that would actually make uh things a lot more easy
uh or make it ourselves very diffic
you could just blame it on television and uh make it their problem
yeah
yeah
yeah
yeah i figured i figure we could do that
yeah yeah sure
okay
or j yeah
uh i'm not sure what marketing thinks about it but
ah i have to uh consult my legal advisor about it
okay
so uh i think we have decided on the things that uh from janus the energy the combination between battery and kinetic
the case will be double curved and uh rubber in a fr flashy fruity colour uh that with cover is removable
the buttons will be uh touch screen
uh but there may not be too many buttons
and in the the menu structure uh there must not to be uh
five minutes to go
uh too uh too many levels
and uh it must be easy to use
the parental control will be incorporated but it must be not too complex
and the games are in it
so
okay
i think we have uh we have decided uh okay
consensus
uh little more
oh
oh
oh
i i have one thing left
yeah
maybe for uh jerome
yeah
i'm listening
um the views
maybe it's uh handy to build in an expert view and a simple view
like a like a moat or s or something
yeah
yeah
um well
like at in the experts view you have a lot of more buttons
user profile
yeah but you have that in the
what i was thinking about is just a menu structure when you don't use it is simple
yeah
yeah
and when you push uh system properties uh entire list pops up with e ev all kind of f stuff you can program
you use the
yeah
mm yeah okay
it's already incorporated a little in that concept
fairly enough
yeah
well yeah you you could actually build in a function that you can program it yourself for the more advanced users
yeah wh which buttons you like or not
yeah which buttons do you want to in it
because you can you can like build in a back forward button and uh some po somebody would just want to watch two channels
yeah
yeah
just leave the other numbers away
okay
yeah you could you could m have people want uh want that
we take it to the other meeting okay
okay
i have a little w uh little chat to do and uh then we uh finish
go on
ah yeah sure
a little chat
i went to uh a master class and uh uh two things uh are uh are uh can come in handy uh for us
first thing uh is uh we talked about knowledge uh management
knowledge engineering and uh uh the fact that uh that uh that the idea of knowledge uh sharing and learning knowledge from other companies is uh like that
it's it's uh very hot at the moment so it's it's mostly for the management expert to to look what other uh marketing or did i said management
marketing
management
oh
just talking about myself
yeah that's my function to okay
uh w
go on
what other companies uh had to uh also with the the the the marketing campaign when they put on a newer remote just some uh yeah
import export
and uh another one
som some bench marker
uh they're a ha they're at yeah benchmarking that's the word i saw
i uh couldn't uh okay uh another uh thing is uh there were there there was a survey
and um uh it came out that um people like to buy things from a single large provider instead of those who uh are partnering uh with us
so we must uh we must bring it as if uh real reaction is uh is big company uh a trustful company and uh it has m
how i know a marketing name for our product
okay
r. th r. to the third power
r. three
real reaction remote
i had a i had another idea to put uh uh the whole the whole idea of uh real reaction and uh uh uh a single brand and uh uh that kind of thing
oh
mm-hmm
when you uh put on remote you see a kind of a just like when you telephone you see a little uh animation
uh logo
bling
yeah
real reaction remote
yeah
and uh with the with the with the motto we put fashion in electronics
and then you go uh
yeah
yeah okay but it has to be like a split second because you have to put in a code also and
the
yeah
well you can show somebody a logo for point five seconds they'll still remember it
yeah
yeah
and it it l linger on every time you see it
but w th the idea from this uh thing is that we must present it as a as we are a a single large provider who will stand on our own
well if you if you have the l l. c. d. screen you can you can uh have a small logo i uh at the bottom
yeah
and it could just stay there
that spins around like all the time
mm yep yeah
yeah that spins around or something
very annoying
also also
hmm
but we we are uh
it it's just like a uh globe in internet explorer
yeah yeah y yeah yeah
yeah
yeah
yeah something like that
okay but uh think about that kind of things
a small icon
yeah i it's ok for f
that's what they said in the master class
okay
oh for the next meeting right
n uh next meeting starts in thirty minutes
who uh
so uh maybe you can go to paris and milan uh once again
who who gave you the master class
the master class
ronald betenberg
franz mehler's
okay thanks
uh very special uh next uh session
uh idea that you uh the the industrial uh development uh centre and uh user interface uh will work together on a prototype
and uh will drawing it on the smartboard
so that's a kinda new uh thing
ah
and um the marketing expert will uh will uh ke he will be keeping busy with the product uh evaluation
but the most uh specific instructions will be sent to you by email
um
so we're going to work together right now
stay here and
yeah the well uh dids this what i uh what i heard
i
in the master class
not in the master class
yeah
so you uh just wait for the specific instructions and uh but i think it was a very uh very good uh session uh gentlemen
p.
ah no new email
definitely
me too
i will thank you all
okay
well thank you too
thank you
thank you very much
and uh
thank you too lord
give me a good evaluation
yeah
'kay guys lot of success
uh-huh
you wish
m aye
see you
cheers
cheers
see you in a half hour
hey
but keep an eye on your uh laptops for a real uh
yeah uh i'm not sure if we uh we because i saw something about individual actions
yeah but th there's there's still the my uh instructions that you will work together
yeah
here
or uh
that's not my problem
yeah
if you got a no
bye bye
well yeah
so stupid manager
the project manager always works alone
right
uh
do you have new email
no
don't get what's
hmm
wouldn't wanna be project manager
uh what we going to do
um once again i'm uh gonna take minutes
so um no presentation for me
uh first we have a prototype presentation by g. and g.
afterwards some uh
yo
j. and j.
eval eval evalu evaluation s sorry
evaluation
evaluation
evaluation criteria
uh evaluation crit criteria
uh in combination with the finance i um uh i received uh a an uh an excel uh file
hmm
which we have to fill in later on
um you see
uh and then we must see uh if we uh stay under the twelve and a half euro
hmm
interesting
ah okay
oops
so that's uh that's a big l so let's uh wait it uh um we have we have must uh
cool
mm-hmm
that's gonna be t problem
some creative uh
we must have uh some time for that uh because it will be uh yeah quite a lot of mathematics
oh
yeah
and after that uh uh an evaluation of uh the process how we uh how we have done it here with the smartboard
with the with our laptops with the all uh all this
and uh afterwards uh we closing
once again forty minutes so uh let's start
ok okay
i would g give the word to um g. and g. for the prototype presentation
shall i give a short introduction and then uh
yeah well sure
j. and j.
okay
j. and j.
j. and j. okay
jane and jane
'kay guys take it away
hi
take it away
um this was our first concept
we decided to use a single touch screen
so we've worked out this concepts how to how to hold it where to put the buttons and and stuff
and um well we began with uh with a form of shape
that is uh is easy to hold w in one hand left or right handed
so we made i it a little bit less thick and uh it has some ar artistic meaning
no
this uh isn't nothing
idea maybe uh is better
um well during the meeting i showed you the concept of uh placing the buttons on top usable with your thumb
and uh the menu structure uh if necessary with your other hand so it's just gonna hold it easily
and it has to be acce accessible with your uh other hand too of course
so we began uh working out a concept
yeah uh well and as you saw we would just have the basic remote with the panel l. c. d. uh screen
well these would be the main buttons h you could uh change them later on in your own profile if you want to
but well it's standard they will be delivered with this kind of uh set up
we have the more advanced menu uh setting right here
we have the sub menus and stu stuff
we made a top oh or a front view
just so like you wanna uh back view
as you can see this uh there there are uh two uh weird bumps in it
this is for uh the added uh effect of uh well uh y youth and dynamic
and uh this is for the artistic effect
well what we figured is uh we'll show you a picture later on you have more b a better idea after that
but idea is for to stay in balance with these two uh with these two
hmm
and so when you put it on the table it will just lay down
it won't uh roll around or stuff
but it will lie more in your hand like an old telephone maybe or like these old uh phones
mm
y you you may get the idea
so thi this is about uh how we figured it should be
the s panel we g you would hide with some more uh rubber layers like we discussed early on
uh you would s you wouldn't see the uh straight panel but more fluidly and round
yeah the panel just uh of course goes like this
yeah
but the overlaying layer is uh a little bit uh curved and stuff
okay
no okay
and uh in these bumps you could actually uh put some electronics uh that would you can make a more thinner uh design
yeah
and that would actually look very nice yeah
yeah
and uh about the colour what have
yeah
oh we added that this um can be held with your hands for this maximum is om yeah one and a half centimetres
so you have room here for your battery and maybe even other um electronic chips
s and you can just be the the layer of the touchscreen and some have some wires underneath it to make it as uh thin as possible in the middle for good grip
okay
hmm
yeah f uh as colours do you do you have the picture in uh
yeah
oh yeah
now well this is the idea about uh the bumps
uh you can see there's a v a very uh youthful uh dynamic uh exterior
it uh you just want to hold it you uh you are young and uh dynamic like us
's l it's like an uh easter egg
yeah it's like an e but this is for children
yeah
we we want a more adult version
but this is like a remote control for children
it's called a weemote
a weemote
weemote
yeah
weemote
hey that's actually a brilliant uh marketing stand
wait what i w got in mind
uh but so this actually basic the idea
yeah
we we just want to build a more uh adult vers adult version of of this
mm-hmm
yeah i can imagine that
and and for colours we we figured starting with basic colours like uh white or metallic grey
those are the technological colours actually so it d
yeah
it would be best to to appeal to a broad public and make the covers exchangeable
so the young people will buy an orange and a red and blue and a purple
or blue or whatever
but when the o older people uh go in the shop and they see uh an orange um remote control it would be less appealing than a white one
and young people we think are a little bit more flexible they think ah i'll buy for a couple of euros some noi nice hip uh
hmm
hmm
maybe it's an idea to sell it without a cover so that you can pick a cover in the in the shop
well
um i think a cover is necessary 'cause als otherwise you'll just have the l. c. d. screen
yeah okay
yeah okay
so there must be some cheap standard cover um maybe white or something
hmm
mm
that's could comes with it and you can buy so we can make extra money
yeah but uh you d you mustn't forget that uh our target aim is younger people
oui okay
uh we had decided to uh put uh some flashy fruity colours in it
uh and uh in the survey from uh milan and paris uh it uh it came out that uh uh the d the older people are uh more willing to uh to spend money on extra features
okay
so i think uh it will be a better idea to have some uh flashy fruity colours as as a standard
the other way around you mean
oh yeah
and for the people who uh really want uh a more sophisticated more traditional look they're willing to pay uh that
uh-huh
yeah
they want uh they want more luxury stuff but they have the money to do it and they want to b to buy that
mm-hmm
okay
so maybe it's an idea to put that as an extra and not as a standard
yeah
yeah
yeah maybe yeah perhaps you're right
uh i i would i would actually agree with this sounds logical
okay yeah
an another idea
uh maybe we could uh develop a cover uh with wood style
yeah
they'll please the elder users as well
yeah
well yeah a colour of a wood style a white c and uh a couple of h hip uh fruity colours
yeah
yes
nah
and lea uh l delivered standard with a fruity colour but not too not too much
yeah
not not too uh yeah
this is banana and mango not not purple or p orange and yellow
yeah exactly
yeah
but the mai i think th uh the standard must be some kind of uh uh attractive flashy colours
yeah
or blue or
not too but w a little because that's our aim
ah
mm-hmm
yeah li like like this like this
yeah
this isn't this isn't too much is it
yeah
yeah okay
i f
no
yeah
well the buttons don't have to be uh all uh all of yeah
well i i i think so
yeah
the buttons i
yeah except for the buttons it's it could be a standard model
it
okay
yeah
yeah uh something like this would be nice
okay
okay
okay that's that's it from us
thank you
'kay it's my time now
it's my turn
the marketing expert
uh oh
okay
during the
oh
during the design uh design life cycle we uh
sorry
we made lot of requirements and trend analysis and stuff
um now is the time to uh evaluate our prototype concept to uh
to the past requirements
so we are going to evaluate the design according to the past user requirements and trends analysis
um we're going to do that with a seven point scale
opening a word document now
okay
one oh okay uh i have to expla explain something
we have to
uh
be consensive about about things
so it has to be a group uh group decision
okay
okay so we gon we gonna evaluate the
uh
we're going to vote
we yeah
the prototype
yeah the the thing we saw
yeah
okay just saw
okay one
the remote control is designed for people with age below forty
yeah
seven
seven is false
uh true
yeah b one or
sorry
yeah one i think
most true
why
yeah it's not just uh designed for people under the age of forty
mm
it's also designed for people above forty
yeah so so a o one is appropriate
yeah
yeah
so
or more like a four
no no a little more in the middle
no uh three or yeah
i have i've yeah two or three because it's not just uh the qu question is aimed at is it designed for people with age below forty
three
okay
but it's also designed for people of age above forty
ah exactly
so
exactly
i'll say it's about three
yeah it will be primary appealing to to m minus forty but also appealing to
okay
three
yeah
but also for yeah okay
uh second
the remote control is beautiful
yeah
it's wow
yeah acco according to us it's one
or
yeah i i think
yeah it's the marketing uh angle on television
yeah
yeah
yeah p s
we have a wonderful
of c of course you have to be uh very positive and uh enthusiastic about your own product
yeah
well it's also fancy then
three
uh the remote control looks fancy
yes
yeah
yeah
one
of course
yes
yep
we have a perfect remote
good
four
the remote control has big clear channel switching buttons
yes
yeah yeah oh they have to agree but
yeah
yes
leads to user face yeah
daniel
i'm the user interface uh expert
uh teletext buttons and volume buttons
um uh no
no teletext buttons
teletext is in the menu
you you've different menu
false
yeah false
and volume is impo yeah
and volume
volume is true
true
uh hmm
big and clear
yeah the they are big and clear
yeah yeah big and clear
yeah big and clear
but you could make a teletext button uh six
hey
otherwise the people who read this uh are gonna think we have no teletext button
hey
hide
yeah but but the teletext button
yeah you can ch that's in a menu
it's it's not yeah it
so it's w yeah it it it it isn't entirely unclear but so i wouldn't give it a seven
j
i would give it a more a five or a six
no
yeah
five
okay
uh i don i don't know
what do you think uh mister project manager
yeah it's it's yeah
oh okay
well i agree
i was thinking very black and white
hmm
yeah
black and red
thank you j.
okay don't forget to save it
red
okay
volume
uh
the remote control is easy to be found
uh well when we put in fancy colours yeah and yeah
fruity
yeah it has these all these fruity colours and it has a strange shape
so if you so if you have trouble finding it
but um it it's not making any sound uh have we deciding
oh okay but 'kay look
so
if you put uh your normal uh remote control under your bed or you throw this remote control under your bed is it better findable
it'll make a difference
we have the better re i don't know
yeah i think so
my remote control's black
a li little bit maybe
a little bit but yeah
yeah
well we p we can do it glow in the dark
four
uh
fi
k yeah
so if it's in the dark place you still see it glowing
i
fo fo yeah fo five is
ah i i i think five
it's it's it doesn't really make a lot of
well then uh then i'll go for four
four
because uh four is between three and uh uh also between between true and false
yeah okay you're right
uh
yes but five is between four and six
i think ah you must see it as
so i'll i'll go for four
uh w uh according to uh the the other uh remote controls
wha
there may uh uh be there in your uh t. v. room this one will stand out i think
yeah
b.
yeah
yeah that that's a better question actually
yeah
yeah it it's
yeah
exa i think that that's what it's about
if your uh fifteen remotes in a drawer uh you find it yeah
if it if this lying on your couch you're you're you think what's that for kinda orange uh thing
yeah yeah
but but the survey under users was that they uh really lost it
so
yeah
yeah that's stupid
like no not uh not seeing it but lost it in the house or something
okay
uh but when you lost it you're just not
but okay
well if i if you see a strange shape lying somewhere uh then you'd uh recognise it as whoa that is strange
that's our remote control
yeah okay
yeah mostly when you lose your remote control it it's under your
yeah
yeah what is that
yeah i i agree i agree
uh
okay
so it's
most of times when you lose it you're sitting on it
eight the remote control has fresh fruity colours
uh
true
um i would call uh choose two 'cause we decided not to make two f uh fresh colours as it would not
yeah yeah not too flashy
yeah
the remote control is made of soft material
um
yeah rubber is kind of soft
kinda soft but but not this
yeah but not too soft we have decided
three
yeah
three yeah
yeah
yeah yeah easy to use very afford
easy to use
one
easy to use
yeah can it be zero
well i don yeah it is kind of
top easy to use
it's it's not the most easy to use
it
no you can do two because um it can be easier
no
uh
it can be easier
it could yeah
jus just with ten buttons that's the easiest
but then you're l yeah but then you'll lose function f yeah functionality and our fancy uh look so
functional ability
yeah
yeah but the most uh easy to use is just with one button
but
it is r it is rather easy to use because you have the primary buttons always visible
on t
yeah okay but easy n not not the most easy to use i think
no it's it i i'll go for two
no
my vote's on two
two
yeah m mine too
okay two
yeah two
we also have to compare it to the uh
to the remote controls on the market nowadays
so
yeah but waits just a minutes
inspiration
what's the time
we also have uh to do the evaluation uh the production costs and uh stuff
these are the m regular remotes
yeah yeah i'm uh hurrying
okay eleven
the remote control is innovative
yeah
yes true one
yes
a very of course
you're agree tim
you haven't seen a more innovative uh thing in uh paris
the remote control has m remova removable from multilux
yes one
very multifunctional
no
the remote control i it has speech recognition
false
yes it
false
this is used with speech recognition this
the remote control has built in games
yes
but uh maybe make it two because the games are in a sub menu and not uh it's not an entire game
yeah but they are built in so it's one
yeah they are built in
yeah
yeah okay
not down
okay
and the last paren parental advisory function
you really like the parental advisory
yes
freak
yes i do
th did you make this or the
bu
save as
yeah he made it
yeah
it changes it maybe
okay i will uh
oh yay
do the the math
oh dear
now it's your turn
okay thank you
we'll see
hmm
mm
okay we have now to c uh to calculate the production cost
if it's under uh twelve and half euro then it's uh ok uh okay
but i is it if it is b huh
no this isn't right
okay so
redesign
if they're under twelve fifty
oh yeah if they under yeah
no
oh yeah
yeah
cau 'cause so it's okay
yeah it's sorry
yeah if the costs are under twelve and a half euro
uh then we uh can uh ra uh move on to the project evaluation as we have uh experienced it
otherwise we have uh do uh have to do a little uh redesign uh thingy
so
uh we have to fill in the numbers of the component uh components
we have to uh fil uh want to uh do it in and uh see uh if we stay under the twelve and a half euro
so do we have uh a hand dynamo
no
no
that's zero
me too
battery yes
yes
battery one
one
yeah
one yeah
okay
kinetic one
kinetic one
yeah
yeah
yeah
okay solar cells zero
yeah
okay uh simple chip on print
uh n no
no
no
advanced chip
no
no advanced chip
no
yes
sample sensor sample speaker
no the advanced chip is uh
no
advanced chip is three
three
three euros yep
yeah
uh we have one
yeah uh but it it's one one thing it's three euro
we have one
okay one piece yeah
no sev zero
uh what's the sample sensor
no
well that's um yeah speech recognition and s
speech recognition i think
yeah you give it a sample uh one
okay
zero
uh uncurved flat
no
no
a zero
no
but is it s it's not made from a single uncurved thingy and then uh and then uh no
no
you no
no
no
thingy
okay
so it's only uh once double curved
yeah
yes three
yeah 'cause um the layer around it fits around the bubbles on the o on the uh the back of the
eight
okay
we're now in a problem 'cause uh we have uh reached eleven euro yet
uh we don't have anything else
so
okay go on
okay but uh we have
just go on
just go on
then we'll see uh we'll we'll see uh wha how much we are over budget
okay
could you step a little to the right ma yeah
two
oh sorry
two
uh rubber
or
you
zero
and zero
titanium no
special uh is the special colour
special colour
mm
i don't think so
no this is a standard colour
no
yeah but we want to make uh the wood colours uh that uh
yeah
s
yes this is a special colour
yeah if if you're honest we'll uh type one special colour
yeah but but d but daniel tha that's that's another brand
that's an add on
yeah one
that's another article
to sell
yeah
yeah but we we going to yeah yeah that's true
but yeah it's it's it
uh j maybe we'll finish uh the the list first and then look back aye
that doesn't account for this
producing this
okay the push button no
no
scroll wheel no
scroll wheel no
no
no
oh no
yes one
one yeah
uh button no
no
no
no the the we don't have a s no
mm is it no
these three
no
no
well we're only four euro over budget
okay
oh okay
so
but
so um what's the thing we can change
no
well other case we can make it single curved or uncurved
no
yeah
uh can i uh i say something
mm single curves
yeah of course
no can i say something uh as project manager
yeah
just cut off the kine yeah
the kinetic thing can we just skip it because uh you have to shake it but that's not really innovative
yeah
or yeah
okay sure
yeah we just put a good battery it it
yeah
mobile phones nowadays
daniel
yeah
daniel what do you think about here
yo
sorry yeah yes
what do you think about uh putting a battery in it but also selling like uh the covers
yeah
a docking station just apart from the from the thing so that you can uh put uh
mm-hmm
rechargeable batteries in it and just
okay
but you can use rechargeable batteries anyway just you s you have to recharge them manual
yeah and not really
yeah yeah okay
but we if you forget about the kinetic well if we do that
just an idea
yeah that's a cost reduc
yeah sure
yeah
we shall
ah
okay well you you can go from double curved to single curved
so um
yeah of course
and that would solve the budget problem
uh b but i but the single curved is just oh
yeah so we have to bake the ba back flat and then
yeah
it's just yeah well the single curve that
no it's it's just one curve and not a back uh curved i think
oh okay okay
or
yeah
exactly yeah
or are these two curves
so that's wh tha that's one option
yeah
uh
and then w yeah and then we could have it
yeah
but uh it's its' well it's it's r it is the main point of the the the the look
yeah but what else uh do we have to cut out
we going to cut
no advanced chip uh that's a little bit of problem
no tho uh that that can be done
yeah
so uh
although can we make it with a regular chip
okay a little less uh conversation
curvy
hey those ar arcs why are there for
sorry
the blue blue uh
fill in just a
okay
explanation
explanation
twelve fifty
i can delete it for you if you want
well
no no no
so if we do this uh we're on uh twelve and a half euro
and we're done
yeah but does it fit with our design
do we have to u adapt it
uh well the only uh thing that don't
it's single curves
yeah single curved but there's a curve in it
yeah
w
so
could we just make the bubbles uh cut off the back and then we're uh has
yeah we just make it flat
okay
but wha 'kay look what is the uh if you make it double curved it costs one euro more
but you do l
more
yeah
but
you make it optional
no but
does it have a lot of extra uh fun function more like
function
functional
worth does it have added worth
uh there's an a a athe aesthetic value but not functionality
yeah
no um
yeah it's really a static value
yeah uh aesthetic
yeah
i mean uh you make like eleven and a half euros profit
instead of twelve and a half
but
i don't know if twelve and a half is uh a fixed uh fixed price
yeah well let's assume it is
yeah it is
no we can't go above that
yeah
oh
we we should assume it i that it is
yeah okay
yeah
yeah okay
but i i figured that the kinetic would be a marketing promotion
then it's okay
r if you uh promote a kinetic um i kinetic remote control i mean that would b sell better than an a normal remote control
yeah
yeah
do you think
yeah i think so
well now you can shake your remote control
no well y i mean uh y you can go into your neighbour and tell him ha my k uh remote control is kinetic
kinetic
you have standard old battery control uh remote con
yeah
yeah
what a what about all the m the environment freaks
yeah
not freaks the envi
yeah but it doesn't fit in our co cost profile
so
no
i i think it's it's
true
it look like this one
you ma can make an an especialised extra gold version
yeah
who because if you want to go to kinetic you're uh you're on thirteen and a half and you must go to flat
and i think now it's it's more of uh a compromise
yeah
yeah
thing
and if you make the single curve ha just a big curve
then it's uh then it's uh yeah one big good curve
yeah just one big curve
i was going to uh say nasty words but i don't
this is strange by the way
wood is m is is is cheaper than rubber
we thought that wood would be more expensive
yeah
uh this uh american figures
you just cut down some trees
yeah maybe
but uh that this is this is it
yeah
this is it
okay this is it
whoever makes uh a remote control out of titanium
i'm gonna save it
yeah
yes
it is possible but you can't use double uh curves for titanium
no
that's one of the functionability uh
okay well
considering we have
ah no we have to do all those hours again
go back
one back
costs on uh no redesign
well we were above so we did a little redesign
yeah
we sue
yeah okay yeah
we yeah we'll start her all o all over again
okay um now uh it's about time to uh talk about uh this project
uh some uh things
were there uh room for uh was there room for creativity in our meetings or in your individual meetings
um
hmm
i i didn't think so
that there was a lot of room for it
but that's mainly because uh of the information that was delivered to us
yeah
it was just fixed information and get your stuff from there and i couldn't go on on i on the internet and search my own stuff
yeah
yeah yeah yeah
bu
that's true
i agree with that
well i th i think you two uh especially you and uh and uh daniel
you d you you both had uh the less creative uh roles in the project
yeah
yeah
that's true
for us there was a lot of creativity
'cause i think m
we could just sign up an uh remote if we liked
yeah
yeah
yeah that's true
i think jeroen and i we had a more design we could have more we had more room for creativity than than you two
yeah
yeah
yeah that's true
okay
uh how about the leadership
uh
ha
leadership was uh crappy
crappy
nah the leadership wasn't crappy it was the leader that was crappy
cra
yeah
okay
okay thank you very much
nah
no the leadership was okay
now we're done
yeah example of crappy leadershi
no leadership was uh
okay yeah
okay i thought uh the first meeting was a little bit of unstructured meeting
yeah it was good
yeah that's true
uh you could have but uh it was your first no uh no disrespect or something
but you could have uh structure it a l little bit more
so like i i was talking most of the time the first meeting meeting and yeah
yeah
you could of said shut up you fool
yeah
yeah
but
i notice it too
i was a i was also very uh unhappy uh very unsatisfied uh about the
about me
about the first meeting
so uh i hope uh uh the the the other meetings uh
yeah you made up
try to learn from your mistake
and we will never do it again
get better and uh i think the the last two meetings uh also we we reached uh some good decisions about uh talk yeah
no it you did better
yeah more more consensus
yeah
ev everybody w was agreeing every yeah
much more constructive
okay so uh that's cool
uh teamwork
well maybe that's uh only yeah well it's for us because uh
well we work together on a project but everybody has his own task
yeah
yeah and it's wo more like presentation and some points were discussed
so it is a little bit
yeah
but really teamwork were you two uh
no
two guys
well it went okay
the
yeah that went w it went well
it's it's just uh
yeah
stupid stupid pen but uh
no hard feelings
nah
yeah we we had some trouble with the pen but
yeah
now you you must push a little while
yeah but but draw something uh difficult
yeah but us
yeah
d uh just write your name right now
try to write your name in in writing letters of course yeah
okay
yeah normally uh this uh the w block letter sign it yeah
o just uh okay
just just write your name in in one line
if it's a little bit too small bit quicker now
it didn't
you can be you can go quicker 'cause then it it won't notice it
uh he he knows how it works yeah
oh
i follow the master class for the smartboard so i think that's the that's the main issue
okay
um so uh about this one you were uh you're dealing with um the the the the digital pen
means
y well yeah
th the i
the idea is great but it doesn't work properly
okay
digital pen i thought uh th the first time i did individual work i used it
yeah
uh
yeah
but a and the first two meetings i brought it with me but i didn't use it at all after the first the first meeting
no
yeah
no i have it working
but uh yeah well uh
it's it's not real real use for me
no it doesn't have that much added value to the
huh
nee
well
as uh as i said a m a c few moments ago it i would like myself to write with a normal pen because must um
yeah it's almost the same concept but you can just sim more simply put it on our scanner
yeah
i it's the same concept as the pen where you f have to download the software or s uh very uh slow
m yeah
yeah
and it is still your own handwriting uh popping up in uh word
yes
no and it doesn't give any added value
no uh that's true
not really no
no
and uh the smartboard is uh useful but the the pen is i uh not user friendly i think
yeah not user friendly
yeah
be it it takes a lot of time to draw things and to write things and that's the
yeah and it's it's not very precise
we're trying to m to
yeah like when you do this
yeah it may um yeah and tr try to wri write your name uh in a in a normal uh size yeah
smaller
smaller
yeah smaller
just like when you're writing on a letter
yeah but that's not th the the you when you at a foreign audience you b don't gonna wr uh write uh small
no a as you saw on on this drawing just open open this one or that one
it's uh th it it yeah uh we had more problems even here when we trying to draw these buttons
it's almost impossible to get clear uh when you're uh
yeah
oh
sorry
but maybe there's some function with no it isn't
with uh
and the eraser was another problem
it w t is is this large
and when you try to erase this line y
yeah
well i'm gonna erase my uh name
i'm gonna erase my name there
yeah it's a big uh big eraser
okay
new ideas
m abo what kind of new ideas
um
well the the idea of the touch screen is uh
do you
yeah uh
go on
i'm just uh
new ideas about uh the working of this software about about the project about the remote controls or
yeah
mm yeah i think so
i don't know what what i mean
no
hello
did you heard what he said
know what i mean
i don't i don't know what i mean
oh i have some figure
here
the eva the evaluation the mm the mean uh number is uh one point eight one point eight six
oh
oh yeah
that's interesting
so that's fairly uh fairly good i think
okay because what does it mean
yeah
so true
uh that uh
all the mo yeah are between one and two
all the requirements uh are true or very true right
yeah
oh okay
yep
yeah okay
thank you expert
but the new ideas found for uh wi with working with this uh software
not really just they have to improve it
not really yeah
uh the concept is okay but it has to be quicker
yeah i think
uh it is still opening my programme
n almo almost uh my entire computer is locked up during the process and it yeah just takes too many time
yeah
people will still feel the need to to write it quickly on uh a page and not download it and save it and
yeah
you had expected it to to be uh more more uh
more user friendly
yeah
'cause when you use a pen you can just draw like you d draw normally and you do
yeah
yeah
may maybe the idea you proposed is uh a screen here
yeah
and draw it and it's it's placed over there
yeah
yeah that l
yeah
would be easier
or at least when you you don't have to adapt to the technology just you can write in the way you normally write
hmm
no
and now you have to um keep constantly in mind that you're drawing on this screen
and that's a very bad concept
yep yep
yeah that's true
ah very bad
nah okay i i it's my opinion that i
but
i think this is better than regular flip overs but
yeah it's can be saved easier
yeah
but if you're in normal flip over you a lot of people write text
there's no text option
yeah
and writing text uh yeah you've gotta really do your best to write some
yeah and and maybe some uh functions for uh uh uh circle or uh a square
yeah
you have to draw it yourself now
or maybe even insert picture
yeah
if you have uh some presentation and you have some f
yeah
or text function
just t t type text and that that would be uh excellent
yeah
mean
yeah
yeah but insert image isn't available
'cause then you could
here
picture from scanner clip art
yeah that that can be done already
oh okay
but not the the the the predefined uh squares i think uh
so you can
hyperlink
hey what if you do like hyperlink
with uh w. w. dot google dot com
type type it
oh yeah
re real reaction dot n. l.
maybe
hmm
yes is now is okay
sorry
okay
you'll just make a link in
huh
yeah
well that's nice
there's one way to uh
is it
'kay double click it
maybe if if you're not using the eraser
here
oh
you're erasing
oh sorry
something else th yeah arrow
select
double click it
yeah
here that
okay
well it's
so you have as you saw you have a little uh
oh you can
yeah thank you
you can go uh
yeah okay
there
so there the the the functionality is there but it's not it's not ideal and it's it's very it costs a lot of time to uh
but
to use yeah
to use
yeah
and that's a pity if you uh if you have uh thirty forty minutes uh for this kind of things
yeah
and that's m
and we are now with four people but it well imagine you are here you're with the ten people and everyone uh
that's mostly the case from the over here with the managements you get two minutes to make your case and if you have to do all this kind
yeah
two minutes of drawing yeah
yep
you'll rather use powerpoint and work it out in advance
yeah
and th the one or two things you have to draw when you're there just use a flip board
yeah
what i really miss also is uh
is a d is a turtle is a decision uh decision system like um
with the evaluation you have to
polls like what do you want a one a two
yeah yeah
maybe a a l a little application like uh uh give your own number and click one two three four five six seven
yeah
yeah just like he said with the with the a screen which you can write also uh a kind of voting uh mechanism
yeah j ju ju yeah v voting application
oh
just a little group group decision application
yeah
yeah
but uh problem is well you can't discuss anything well you you ca uh you can
but you will discuss a lot less than l like we did now
yeah
we i mean uh w w w one one person s maybe said three
but well uh i we said uh no i w th think two because this and this and then you can react uh on it
but if you you put a three on it uh just figure well everybody knows what i'm knowing so they'll all just put a two on
yeah okay
yeah of course
but uh you can still discuss about it but but click it in an application that's a lot easier to process
yeah but it would yeah
yeah okay the for processing part
the digit
yeah
but then uh i think the idea of one person entering it and the rest uh discussing it that uh isn't that bad idea actually
yeah
not that your opinion isn't valued but but still
yeah
yeah
okay
okay
okay so
yo manager
that's it
uh well just about because uh
when are w
when are we going to produce it
yeah tomorrow
celebration
uh the costs are within the budget
uh the project is evaluated
yeah
yeah
but before we going to celebrate uh i have uh a little question which you can't answer because uh there must be some kind of end report
i am busy with the end report right now
you might thinking what the hell was he doing uh
what is an end report
uh about all the meetings what we have decided a r r a report of this day
yeah
yeah yeah
uh that must be made but i don't know here is uh standing uh whoa we can celebrate now but the end report is
oh you ha you have ten minutes left i uh read
oh
you have now ten minutes left to finish up the end report
okay well that uh that can be done
maybe we can do it uh together
you can see what i've uh yeah
yeah
so i i s i will uh put it on a story board
yeah sure
you can see it
um
because i think it will uh it must be uh
you you already made a beta version or
yeah it's a three uh with seventy five uh
pages
yeah just about
y yikes
seventy five pages
well just a moment
end report
okay daniel
do you want a chair maybe
a chairman
hey
no no no i'm just uh you can s you can read it and uh here here it is
oh okay
end report
so you you finished it actually and so we just have to read it and say yes or no
yes
well this not nit it read only
but it's not uh fully finished yet
five minutes for finishing
um this is about the functional design the things yeah yeah
management expert you have to change that
oh yeah
i'm uh when i said it i remember i had it here
marketing
it's a read only version
yeah but you can save it u the under another name
oh okay
marketing expert okay
um
about the three functions where uh which are most used and uh which must uh immediately be visible on our uh remote control
um it must be uh simple to use very clear what to do and at the younger people
so this is really about wh uh what kind things uh must be in it and uh yeah
maybe um the
uh
the
yeah i understand you i can talk a little bit dutch
yeah
you yeah
no you have to put uh switch channels uh at the top because that's the most used function and teletext at the second
oka okay okay i
i really didn't knew that
oh nay a volume changing second
so this one's first
s switch yes
you go there and you go there
yeah
so okay
okay go on
well maybe i can then do it one two three
yes very good
one two three
if the order is in uh is is uh important that's the word for
yeah
yeah
the order
uh
then the conceptual design
uh well all the things we have uh discussed uh the energy which uh turn out to be uh batteries so that's
yeah
well okay maybe you can add it later that we decided in the end because of the cost
yeah because yeah
uh he here it is still double curve the rubber the flashy the fruity the removable
single curves
uh the buttons hmm
it's not double
uh it's not double anymore eh
a single curved
not double anymore
no okay
nay but that this is what um
yeah okay
was initial the plan
yeah
yeah
the initial plan
and the the added functions like tetris snake it's under the parental control the touch screen
on thing uh
so it's uh just a summary of what uh we had discussed uh
one small thing uh the added functions
uh was it included in the cost
i don't think so eh
ah it's very cheap
it's very cheap
uh it's very cheap you you maybe you you you you come at uh
no it's it's not very cheap but that no but it's a development inside corporation
it's very necessary
like uh w we don't have to buy parental control
our own people can make that i think
yeah but it still has some yeah
yeah
yeah it it has some cost but
okay but so we can discuss that uh
he'll do it in his free time
so uh
yeah
we can discuss that kind of things i think with the
with the the board of uh
of directur or directors
what's it what's the company called
i just keep forgetting it
real reaction
real real reaction
yeah
real reaction yeah
you can ask your personal
okay so uh anybody uh misses something here about uh
yeah the end conclusion
but uh
yeah okay that's that's what i'm gonna write b between now
okay
still the end conclusion
that's all i think
but i in here nothing uh
um the decision to make um the buttons on the top and the menu on the
mm-hmm
on the bottom
and clearly yeah touch screen you've mentioned
yes
yeah touch screen i've mentioned
yeah but but the the decisions are put in the uh conclusion i think
okay
why we decided to use a flat uh l. c. d.
okay this n yeah
yeah okay well i gonna redesign uh something now
yeah
no
um
party party
because i think it will oh five minutes from to finish meeting
oh before you change anything maybe you um save it first
save it
hmm
you can't you can select file and export and then those j. peg files
yeah but then you had the same thing
well eight
and we have uh another blank one
example of children remote
did we change anything
oh wait
wait
wow
yeah
it's a new uh commercial logo
hmm
that's a pity
don't save it aye
oh that's cool tim
uh
finish meeting now
well i'm i'm
why are only the first five smartboard files
i'm going to finish my end report
saved
okay um hereby is the meeting is finished
you declare
i am the one who can say that
yeah
hereby the meeting is finished
yeah
hello
dang it
and then you have to place your laptop exactly on the marked spot
alright
it's important to place your laptop exactly on the marked spot over here
okay
no that's okay
joost your mouse
what
no mouse needed
i've got a touch pad
do you know how how i can wake it up
mm
a touch pad
no my laptop
slap it
you with your brilliant ideas
i don't know if i can touch the power button
do you know how how i can wake it up
is
no
yeah
try the power button
oh
come on move it
um
now wake up bitch
huh
f. five
f. five
i've lost my screen
uh
yeah so did i
i closed it
i don't
that wasn that wasn't very smart i guess
come on
get back to me
yes
yes
i closed the
i closed it
you've got your name
yeah my name is name
no i didn't restart it i just closed it
yes
hope it working
alright
no
never close your laptop
yeah
everybody's ready
great
yeah
great
thanks
well welcome to the kick off meeting
i uh forgot to put my name over here it's uh it's martin
uh so you all know
well this is the agenda for today
well the opening is what i'm doing right now
uh we gonna do some acquaintance acquaintance things
uh give some um
examples of the tool training project plan discussion and the closing
we have twenty five minutes
okay the project aim is to design a new remote control
mm-hmm
uh some of the oje objectives are that is has to be original trendy and user friendly
so now we all know what our
okay
goal is
um i oh forget i forget the whole acquaintance part but we we all know each other
we all know each other's names
joost guido antek
yes
what is your name
yes
antek
antek ahmet
okay
and joost
i think we uh al already uh been through that part
okay
yeah
okay it consists of uh three levels of design
uh we begin with the functional design then we go to the conceptual design and the detailed design
every uh level of design consists of some individual work and we uh close it with a meeting
you all received an email with a example of our explanation of what uh the particular level of design uh means to the different uh functions
and uh you p you probably read that already so i don't have to tell you about that
yes
yes
okay first we're gonna um uh gonna try some different things with the tools we have over here
so you get acquainted with these uh um uh meeting tools
we have the smart boards uh the thes those two boards
this is the presentation boards wh which one i'm using right now
you can uh um there's a document folder called um the sh shared document folder
you can upload your uh documents to that folder and then you can open them over here so you can do your powerpoint presentations on this screen
we also have the white board
uh we're gonna skip through th
can we see the white board on our laptops
no no
just on the on the screen over there
no i saw i saw the file the smart board that x. b. k. but
oh no
probably is but i don't know if the software is on the laptop
is is if it's mainly a thing for in the meeting so i don't think it's i don't know if it's important
okay
this an explanation of the smart boards
there is a tool bar over here
it's quite simple
you have the the pen function eraser function
it's like a very simple uh paint application
uh we well we use the same file during uh the whole day
and uh you can make new sheets by uh by pu puttin pressing on the blank button
it works like this
oh
if pen is selected yes
oh no no
with that pen
it's not
but it is pen
it's not working like a pen yet
mm
huh
huh
mm
it's doing some stuff now
little bit slower
so you can use a pen
you can use an eraser
and you can make new uh fi uh new blanks
and you can change uh the line width and the colour of the pen by pressing on forward which y you have to select pen format
and then select current colour or line width
so it's quite easy
uh well now you're all uh acquainted with the different tools
right we're gonna try out the electronic white boards
uh every participant should draw his favourite animal and some of its favourite characteristics on blank sheets with different colours with different pen widths
uh i'll start off then
i'll use this uh same sheet
alright
oh let me think
different colours
oh
well i'm gonna draw um a p piranha
uh a fish
piranha
okay
uh
mm-hmm
oh
i'm gonna use some different colour now
some a little white
looks like a fish
think it is
oh
oh
uh colour
this is black
i think so
yellow
oh
oh this is just uh
useless uh
drawings but oh teeth
i need teeth
well they're not supposed to be green or whatever colour this is
hmm
okay
what was uh i have su to sum up its favourite characteris well i like its uh sharp razor sharp teeth
different
plus uh the the big uh forehead and uh a small uh well a small actual face
and i like its overall uh aggressive look and
well that's what i like about uh piranha
okay
i think that's kind of what uh the intention should be
well who wants to be next
nobody i guess
i will try
you go guido
yeah
okay
i will try
uh
uh make a new sheet
uh it's by pressing on blank
blank
yep
okay
then pen again
yep
okay
and uh so in the format menu you can choose the different uh colours and uh pen widths
okay um
format
control
uh
ah purple
um i don't know what my uh favourite uh animal is but the easiest animal i can think is is a bird
uh i will
you know i thought of that actually
that's my bird
yeah
yeah
isn't it quite it's a little bit light
uh another colour maybe
a red one
a small one
uh line width
two
three
oh that's okay
that's another one
well tell us something about uh your favourite characteristics of these uh particular birds
ano uh uh it's a yeah it's uh the most simple uh animal i know i think
its simplicity
um i don't know
maybe because uh there's there's some s uh free uh maybe in the sky or something like that
oh okay
okay
maybe a little bit
yeah
i don't know
okay
no uh it's clear
so more uh birds
n no no
we get your point
okay okay okay
okay
who wants to be next
yeah whatever
i'll go next
thanks
i haven't got a favourite animal too so
m
pictionary
oh
what should i draw
a cow
oh
thank you i'll draw a penguin
okay
yeah
i'll draw a penguin
whatever
i can't draw so
you can start to laugh already
i'll do so
whatever
something like that
come on
yeah it's little bit hard
mm-hmm hmm orange
orange of course
whatever
oh it's better than your bird
uh yeah
everything's better than your bird
yeah
true
whatever
hey it's blue
no
whatever
um i like its ugliness and uh yeah whatever
the way it walks or whatever
okay
your turn
'kay
drawing
i'm going to draw a cat
i don't know why but a cat is a very uh smart animal
and you can have them at home
which is not as the case with uh with bingwings and
well you can have a piranha at home
ye yes yeah
huh
or a line
a little bit
i mean a bird
yeah
don't mess with my birds yeah
it's not very uh
very good drawn but you can see a cat from it
hmm
it's a handicapped cat
cat
i don't think uh i don't think uh darwin would agree with that
it's
ah it's not scared
he's crying but
he's crying because it's ugl because of his ugliness
okay
what do you like about it then
uh it's i most cats are small
oh okay
you can handle them
okay
okay
okay and then we are uh through the tool training i guess
okay
i wouldn't call it training but
okay this is uh something about the project finance
the selling price of our remote control is gonna be twenty five euros
and our profit aim is fifteen million euros
we're very ambitious on this one
the market range is international so it's gonna be sold world wide and the production cost should be a maximum of twelve euro fifty per remote control
so that's clear
yeah
okay
alright
okay we're now gonna discuss some stuff when well we're gonna brainstorm about uh what kind of kemoro romo remote control it's gonna be
uh well tell me about your experiences with the remote controls
do you have uh know what good experiences with remote controls
or do they annoy you sometimes
yes
are they difficult to understand or maybe they don't interact with different kind of uh equipment very well
hmm
i don't th i don't think the four of us got problems with remote controls but if you see elderly people
yeah okay
all these buttons and then they buy new t. v. because their previous one was stolen or whatever
different
okay
and then a totally different remote control with with different functions on different places and half of the functions a are removed or whatever
uh so i think what we need is is a clear uh remote control with
uh grouped buttons you know
all th all the buttons which apply to the text functions in in one uh
different functions of of uh
well one area or whatever not like the button to enter text on top of the remote control and the button to um
yeah to minimise it to this this or whatever o o other functions totally somewhere else
okay
i think we should group them
yeah
and same for the for the volume buttons and the the t
okay
and uh is it gonna be a remote control that's um what it can be used for different kind of equipment like your t. v. and your home stereo
well i was i was thinking uh since a t. v. is uh mostly used together with a v. c. r. or d. v. d. player or recorder
yeah
uh
mm-hmm
and not with a stereo i think it should be good to include functions for v. c. r. s and d. v. d. players recorders
mm-hmm
but uh the d. v. d. players and home cinema sets often double as stereo hi fi sets probably
yeah
it's what from my experience
but isn't it
i don't know
hi fi set is uh not often used uh as i know of in combination with television
okay
but we gonna
it's only for television i thought
yes
not
oh it is only for televis
i thought it was only for television
so so we probably don't have to have to uh have the functions for d. v. d. player or v. c. r.
yes it is only for television but uh
so wha what
well
what wha what uh what document
well we we're gonna brainstorm about that
if we think it's useful we do it
but where where did it uh where did you find that
uh in the email
oh okay
that's right
i thought it said uh yeah television remote control
it's a television remote control
but i was thinking since it is useful with d. v. d.
yes
yeah but most television remote controls support other functions as well
yes that's uh something extras
so we can no we have to think about that
true
yeah
true
okay uh but uh we've gonna put some a uh is is it so user friendliness is a is a pri priority in this case or
yep
yeah also no one's gonna buy it
yeah
yeah yeah
okay
yeah
i guess
only the experts
true
well this the maybe is uh some aspect of the uh or or some point at at which we can excel by making it very useful
yeah
that w well then you're you're the usability uh man so this uh gonna be a very important task for you then
oh my god
yeah
okay
okay
well other ideas
how can we make it trendy or something
do uh by just sh shape and the look of it
uh to go with to go with fashion and
maybe a can opener underneath it
for the bear
i don't know
or someth something special like uh m. p. three player inside of it or uh oh well then the production costs are gonna be too high probably
uh
i i uh no i think it
yeah way too high
uh i th i think yo we have to keep it simple to get a whole market
yep
it's international so we have to use a standard
okay
maybe with different type of fronts or uh well m has to be something spectacular or uh one which makes it we gonna skip back to the goals probably
well that's an idea of course yeah
uh
mm-hmm
original trendly and user friendly well we al also already talked about user friendliness
hmm
no well something trendy and original well that that goes hand in hand i guess
yeah
when something is original it tends to be trendy probably or we should make it combination of that
'kay so you the um technical part of the process is something you're gonna look after for
so you have to think about what kind of uh equipment you want to uh you know you want to manage with it
well and that's an important part for you then with gogors regards to the user friendly part of it
use friendly
yep
well and you uh should look out for what makes it trendy
well you know y like some special feature
or some does it does it gets some gadgetness or something
yeah
yes what the market wishes
okay
well the closing
next meeting starts in thirty minutes
individual i think so
the the industrial designer will w or the working design of course we will uh
already s said that
the user interface designer is it a user inter user interface the technical functions design
yeah
yeah yeah
yeah
interface d
and the management expert of uh the marketing expert
user requirements specifi well this one was already clear to us
specific instructions will be sent to you by your personal coach
i don't know how much time we have left
oh not many i guess
we started at twelve
you just got a message
oh and what does it said
and it said uh five minutes so we got four and a half
oh i don't
w
okay well um
i didn't get a message
no
he's the whatever
oh the project manager
team leader
no we're uh ahead of schedule then
team leader
he is the whatever
yeah close it
i'm gonna make some minutes or take some minutes
okay
yes
and uh it's it's clear you can put the stuff in the project documents presentations
okay
you can all or we're all uh
project joc project documents is for showing uh on the white board
yeah
yeah but we're all familiar with uh uh microsoft powerpoint are we
yeah
yes
yeah
yeah okay
i'm gonna wri uh write some stuff down and then we're ready
alright
okay
or we can leave already i guess
yeah
or uh or sh or should we uh or is important that we leave at exact uh
no
no
okay
i don't think so
i don't think oh
yes
yes
great
oh
we'll see each other in uh thirty minutes
yeah
good luck
yeah good luck
i will need it
i will need it
here we go again
my mouse is not working anymore
oh
oh
he's uh when i put it in is is going to beep beep beep
okay
oh i got a nice little screen here over here
i got like this big black border uh on every side
okay
mm okay
i'll i'll fix it
everybody ready
yeah it's okay
yeah whatever
welcome at the functional design meeting again presented by maarten
uh this is the agenda the opening
uh we've got three presentations
and i'm gonna show you some of the new projects requirements that were sent to me
and we're gonna make a decision on the remote control functions
we have uh forty minutes
yes
oh well this is the the closing already
so uh well we start off with the th the first presentation then
uh i think um in uh we have to do it in uh in right order
okay
maybe the
i don't know what the right order is
so
well it
no
huh
oh that
it won't doesn't maybe we should start with the the technical functions
okay how can i get this on the whiteboard
yeah
well it's you dumped the file in the uh in the sh in the project document folder
in project
okay i've done that
you've already done that
no can that open
yes
well let's close this one
we'll just uh open a new one
open it there
uh well
yes
uh oh
new thing
oh yeah uh i have to say something
uh due to some uh technical problems i haven't uh digitized the last uh the meeting minutes
but i'll uh make sure that uh happens next time
mm-hmm
okay
about the get
and i'll get this one uh in digital uh form too
'kay we're going to um
uh talk about working design
um the method of the remote control is uh electrical energy it activates a chip uh in the remote
it's an electrical circuit
which compose uh messages in the form of uh uh infrared signals to control the television
mm it's a nowadays very uh known a known uh uh technology
um the known technology can make a cost very low
uh it's a wild uh a wide sale uh of uh remote controls in the world
and and the components are very uh very cheap
um
uh diodes uh bat batteries and uh uh led lights they're needed and they're uh everywhere available
uh again it's a fair price
it's a common uh technology uh like i told um uh the circuit board it's the most um important uh
um part of the remote control
uh we can use for that uh fibreglass with copper wires it's it is uh
can be made as fast as printing paper
it's uh it's all very uh
okay
yeah they're making it uh all the time
uh
okay
and it's not uh very specialised uh technology
i haven't come to here but
um i've got uh some uh images of uh remote controls
they were not uh very uh trendy or just uh
just a remote control like everyone knows
so i don't know uh why i should put it here
uh
okay
but it's the technical side of the remote control
yes but uh i uh haven't made it because uh of the time
oh
okay
but
well we'll we'll have to skip that part then
what
okay
but you don't think it's a problem um to design uh the technical part of the remote control
no
it's gonna be easy
yes
okay
but nothing restricted for user interface
yeah
with technical
um no it's uh it's just a part of uh a known technology yeah
m
i don't know
okay
'kay
remote control is nothing special nowadays
r regardless of what type of functions we want to implement
okay
doesn't really matter
um
but i kind of uh
i don't think so because of the all the televisions uh there are a few maybe a couple of televisions with the new functions
okay
yes
yeah okay
uh
okay
but is it useful to put them on a on a standard uh remote
well we'll see
we'll see later on
well the technical functions
um well i don't know if you got the same uh pictures as i got but uh i got these two
no
no
and i think they're we have to focus uh on uh the uh one hand the expert view or the novice user
th i think it's it's very much uh depending on the user requirements i don't s uh know who's doing t
well uh will there be some uh user requirements later on
yeah but it i think that's very important to watch uh what kind of functions there we want to uh put in a remote control
the ones i i've uh received from the account manager
yeah
well we'll keep this in mind and then discuss it later on
yeah well y we can put functions in it when uh yeah when we uh get the user requirements uh and we can update it
uh-huh
okay but this real this uh big d uh distinction between this type of remote
we should we should choose one uh we should not compromise but uh really choose for uh expert viewer or novice v yeah
yes i agree
yeah
well what that's what you want trying to say
well yeah w if you want try a a a huge market if you want to reach a huge market
uh like elderly people and we have to choose for novice user
okay
okay
but i don't know
it's it's really um depending on how how how far the the the remote controls are already in n um in use
yeah well some of these uh yeah
well some of that will yeah but i but it will be more clear when we come to the uh u uh some of the new requirements
yeah probably yeah
yes
so
uh well there are l at least uh basic functions uh like just th the channels uh one till nine
uh on and off switch which must be clear with a red button or something like that
um most standard uh have volume of course and a mute function and of course the next and previous channel
i think that's just basic what we need
mm-hmm
and from that on we can user requirements what we need more
uh
yeah i just um um i thought joost was looking at the trendy the trends in the markets
yes
and i don't know if there uh are any um uh if you put more functions more buttons maybe it's com becoming less trendy or something like that
i haven't really found a conclusion like that
m you can just you can k you can keep it in mind that
yeah
i don't know
uh i th i thought the the with less buttons you can make a more trendier uh yeah more trendier design i think
design
i think
sounds interesting
yeah
uh well that's all i have to say i think
okay
yeah that was it
alright
well then the marketing expert can uh tell us something about the current market
yes
yeah
it's alright
um
alright i've done some research for functional requirements
um yes
the working method um there were hundred uh uh w h one hundred people uh
how do you say uh f watched using remote controls in the usability lab and they also uh filled out a questionnaire uh with a few questions
uh i've lined them up here
uh ask whether um common remote control looks good or not about willingness to spend money on remote control
about zapping behaviour and uh and stuff like that
i uh have found some interesting things
we do we do got a market
um three out of four people claim m uh to find remote controls ugly
so if we make a trendy design we sure have seventy fi seventy five percent of the market which you can reach
um three out of four users uh zaps a lot as i uh quoted here from the uh results
zap buttons are used one hundred and sixty eight times per hour
that's quite a lot
um
relevant options are of course power buttons
although only used once per hour
uh channel selection volume and buttons for text and the more um yeah
other functions like audio settings video settings sound settings are not said to be very important and uh very much used
furthermore fifty percent says
uh they only use ten percent of the buttons on a remote control
that doesn't say we got we can leave ninety percent off
but
it sure um says we shouldn't make it too uh complicated
fifty percent also claims uh to have lost a remote control very often in the room
and um an important thing here the most important customers uh
which is over seventy percent of our market is in the age range of thirty six to sixty five years old
and uh elderly people our market are less interested in uh nice features but more willingly to spend more money on remote controls
so what i was thinking oh wrong side
we shouldn't implement too much features on uh on our remote control because elderly people will get th lost
group features for a higher usability uh what i was claiming in the previous meeting
um all the settings about audio settings video settings and channel settings which are not very often used
we could group them uh on one button
and make them accessible uh in one menu button or whatever because they are used very rarely and well
it uh there are a lot of options there so we can really make uh yeah how do you say
we can spare at buttons over there
okay
and um if you want to implement v. c. r. and d. v. d. options group them in the button not too uh
yeah
small buttons so they won't be very um how do you say
visually presents
yes won't be very present thank you
and a trendy look well uh although seventy percent of the market is uh consists of elderly people uh who don't really care for trendy looks or whatever
i guess it can do no harm to make it trendy for the other thirty percent
that was kind of what i found
okay
okay
okay
well then we i'm gonna show you some of the new project requirements and then we gonna discuss on uh what features we find important
yes
uh well some of the uh new requirements make some of your findings quite uh irrelevant i think
because um
uh s decided to put they have decide to put two additional requirements forward
well now i see four
two
that's kinda strange
well they say tele teletext becomes outdated since the popularity of the internet
well i think that may be so but well we can't just leave the teletext button off
well
no uh i agree i agree
it's impossible i think
no way
so the compromise we could make is just to make one teletext button you know like on and off
and don't make a lot of special put a lot of special features on it to make it transparent or you know
not too much no
it's just you want you want to be able to make use of teletext but not to play with it that much
yeah
so we have to think of that
the remote control should only be used for television
otherwise the project becomes more complex which endangers the time t t ma uh the time to market
so maybe we should leave all d. v. d. and v. c. r. related features off completely
yeah
okay
i don't know
i think that uh
that's what they're trying to say
uh our current customers are within the age group of forty plus
new products should reach a new market with customers that are younger than forty
so you uh talked about the elderly who were willing to spend more on a remote control and who were interested
mm-hmm
but well they're not relevant because we are aiming at a younger
i don't really agree actually to be honest
it's a very small market which we will approach then if we uh want to reach customers younger than forty
it's only like thirty percent of the total market
yeah but it is it's is a dif it's a fact that the th th that bigger market you're talking about we already cover that
mayb yeah
our company already sells remote control to the older people but we we also want you know a new customer group
that's the one we haven't covered yet
so i think that's
what the problem is
okay
we haven't got remote controls for uh well i think yeah
maybe maybe we can compromise a little bit
yeah i think so
maybe if it's no no but i think we have to just keep in mind what the older age group wants
not too much then bu alright
so maybe we can
make a remote control that's primarily interesting for the younger group but isn't that bad for an older person either
yes
uh our corporate image sh should stay recognisable in our products
our product's corporate colour and slogan must be implemented in the new design
okay something else nice to know
but what's our slogan
sorry
yeah you will have to look that up
the slogan uh
yeah i'll have a look
we put the fashion in electronics
i think it's something about the oh okay
puts fashion in electronics
i thought it w might be let's make things better or something but
sense simplicity
sense and simplicity
okay well let's go back to the
the agenda
so we've now had to the three presentations
we know about the new project requirements
that means we can uh well d yeah discuss on the remote control functions
well if i can uh make a start i think it's becoming more clear what kind of remote control it's gonna be
and i already talked about the maybe you have a f familiar with the rem remote control that has the the can opener underneath it
i think we're we're looking for some yeah we we're looking for a really simple remote control with only basic t. v. functions
y well that
yeah
well to be honest if um our uh aim group is uh till forty
not older than forty maybe that's not very uh yeah we don't really need to have a simple remote control
yeah
yeah
i think we can implement more functions then because um basically uh the younger people are more able to adapt to new technology and therefore will be a more
yeah but wha
yeah yeah
m yeah that's why um well a lot of um the use the requirements the the account manager sent me
but
i think they are are c are contradicting each other because they want a simpler design
yes
and no uh other uh s functions than just t. v. but they s do aim at a younger well ma
yeah but you sai you said that that a lot of functions aren't used
yeah
so why should j we put this function in
well i think
i think more i think uh people younger people are more looking for just a trendy look than uh more functions
but i think uh you we can make some discuss uh distinctions in uh what kin in the know th th in functions you have
y
well you have different kind of uh equipment in your room like a t t. v. and a d. v. d. player
yes
you can uh know
you you can make very d you can put very detailed functions regarding the t. v. set on your remote control uh with the with uh the
you know audio settings and uh v uh screen settings
we don't want that
i think that was that became clear
we don't want
but w maybe we should put some func uh i know that the younger people will most likely have a d. v. d. player they want to
you know they want to uh
yeah control
yeah but uh you said yeah d yeah but th the functions are not in the remote control we're making
control remotely
no yeah th th the user requirements of the the the new project requirements told us not to but maybe w yeah
it's n
yeah
yeah
i think we maybe should
yeah well we should uh put some functions for other maybe for other equipment on it
but just the basic functions
maybe like rewind and wind or n what d what do you guys think
but you can put them under the same button
not much more than that
yep
yeah if as far as possible
or we can u u we could put 'em behind the flip flap or whatever
so t
but what do you think
do th should we implement features that uh uh or functions that to control other devices
no
no you don't think so
no new requirements say no
yeah the new requirements say so
so
but you can put a play and stop and and rewind
well
yeah
maybe it's maybe there there there is something th m most of the time these functions don't support the particular device as well as their their own remote control
yeah but
you know a lot of d. v. d. players have some tricky settings with
yes but we
y yes
i i if it's too simple uh th they won't use the remote control they use their own th th with lot more functions
yep exactly
that's that's wha
but but for for example v. c. r. that's better example in this case
i think on a remote control for television you don't need to be able to programme uh the v. c. r. to start recording at three p. m. or whatever
no no you don't no no you don't need it
no no
huh
exactly
no no
just play stop rewind and uh fast forward
okay but we have to think uh w we have to think d. v. d. i th uh i guess
yeah i know but uh
so um but uh from my experience it's kinda a lot of d. v. d. players you know like forwarding goes differently
uh you get two speed or eight speed or sixteen speed
mm yeah
it's c sometimes a bit difficult
maybe if we just leave the d. v. d. functional m uh well i was thinking about putting it in
but concerning the project requirements and what you just said i think we m should focus on the t. v. then
yes
yeah but just
keep it simple and look more at th
and uh and it's just an uh a complimentary remote and not a universal one
if you want to keep it simple you can make a universal remote
no
it's only for television
okay
so
yes but there are there are
it's just a s it it should be something that is like a gadget on your coffee table
and it's just for when you you you jump on the couch
you pick up the the the nice remote the simple one just to put on the television nothing more
yeah
yeah
yeah nothing more
okay
exactly
alright
um but what televis
but how wi how will you be able to handle a whole market
there are uh a dozen of uh dozens of of remote controls that have
yeah we we'll make w this one trendy
yeah
and simple
the user interface is easy
well we we will come to that but ju first on the on the functions
so we should put uh zap buttons on it
um also numbers to uh to go to the specific channels
and the basic yeah basic functions yeah
yes definitely yeah
uh
it's too much integrated in the other
okay a t a teletext button should be there
but just one big teletext button on and off
yeah
probably
yeah and maybe two or three other options but not nothing more than that
i think stop function is very useful
if you have a uh a page which consists of more pages and you are not a very quick reader
oh okay
then i think it's very irritating if the next page shows up but
yeah but uh i think that becomes too difficult it's not a very common function and people will have to read up on their remote then
well i use it very regularly the action
i re i use it quite often
yeah yeah but maybe you s yeah yeah maybe y you do but i've never heard of it in the first place
will you look
and
we have to well t yeah and t and teletext is becoming outdated
look at the market
we just want to see what programmes are on and what time it is probably
yeah
i don't know
i think that that's kin getting too complex for our remote
well
i don't know what you th guys think
might be
might be
yeah i uh it's sunday i always use it for the uh yeah for the soccer uh
yeah but do you like to have a such a s stop button
or do you think it uh
i think it's a kind of uh uh very rare and special function
well uh when you uh uh when you look uh for example um
a couple of weeks ago i looked at the for the flights and there are a lot of flights in one page so if if th
yeah
okay it goes yeah but that's kind of stuff we should do on the internet right now
that's why it was uh said in the in the use in the r new requirements
yes but you could put
yeah but
on the z on the zap buttons you can put it to uh to uh access all the same pages
if you have seven pages you can go up and down
well yeah uh lots of new televisions can store pages you know
and then you can just skip manually through them using i think we should just put one teletext button on it
yes
true
then we meet uh the new requirements
we also meet the other thin y you sh you just re we have to choose for the the simple design i guess
a simple yeah
okay
um well what functions do we have to decide on
or do we uh i dunno if we have t stif specifically name all the functions we n we want
we have the zap and uh the volume
should we do m make them very big
the the the zap button
d d
i think the plus and the minus button should be uh quite present yep
yes
th that's that's that's considered to be trendy also
but trendy yeah
i don't know
or maybe you should place them on a uh in a special way
maybe we can make uh a kind of a joystick
yeah something or uh somethin special way to to zap through the it has to s it has to be yeah and quick
original
you have to use it very quickly
it was uh
yep
if you grab the remote your hands should be on top of the plus
true
yeah and it the buttons should make it um possible to to zap through your channels in a rapid at a rapid pace
yes
oh what should we decide on then
i think in a in a case of this simple remote control
but
yeah
the technical aspects which uh weren't worked out already but it w shouldn't be a problem then
no it's o just signals uh and the television d uh does the rest
yep
maybe uh
no okay but we don't have to uh when we don't want to uh control other devices i think it makes it even more simple
no
uh maybe we uh uh the batteries maybe
if you use large batteries or small batter batteries
the most standard batteries
i think
i think that we should use uh d yeah
i think double a.
yeah
not not uh the b the watch kind th the most uh well it has to be simple and i wi
yep
yeah
the most ordinary uh batteries
which are most likely to be found somewhere in the house you know
okay
yep
oh
how much time do we ha we have left uh
i think about twenty minutes
m m m more than thirty minutes
uh ten twenty minutes
but i in a way we have to be uh uh special
well uh these these shouldn't
early break
yeah
yeah okay
but that's that's
do you uh have you have you think about tha thought about that
how we can what the extra touch can be
maybe th m
do you suggest design or the shape or some gadget f f kind of feature or well it was something about how we lose them
maybe it should be a remote control when you you clap you hands it makes some noise or some gadget kind of thing
i think that's n that's more for a for an age range or uh ten to twelve or whatever
to find him
yeah
that's maybe yeah
i don't know
i don't know
nah um a lot of people like to have such kind kind of kind of gay kind of things
it w it w should be like a birthday present or something that you give someone and it is i has something nice
yeah yeah that's good one yep
yeah
or maybe it w should have a big uh light that can flash or something on it
or maybe it should or an or the like the the can opener
maybe it contains some feature that you don't normally link to a remote control
i think it's very impor because we're gonna make such a basic remote control we have to do something to make it special
yeah
it's gonna cost twenty five euros
ye i think the can opener i is a brilliant idea actually because television and beer is not a rare combination
yeah but the well it's already been done
yeah but that's yeah
nah
yeah that's true
but and i think it's gonna be uh very uh it has to be sturdy or something
so maybe with with bouncing pads so that you can just throw it on the floor or something
yes
it has to be used something special and you really it has to
yeah
yep
you know y not s people when they buy it they have to think well this one lasts for a long time
we're really gonna use them
not some thing you you throw away next week you know
no that's true
so maybe uh that's i i think that's when uh when we decide on these type of functions
know basic functions uh it's very important to find something like this
so there's a very important task for you
and maybe we can all think about it
be original yeah
uh also for you maybe when t you it's very nice when you can be entra when you can be trendy
and and uh and al as in a friend use friendly as well you know
mm-hmm
and use friendly yeah
so big buttons flashy design and maybe some kind of gadget kind of thing
yeah
yeah
must brain storm
uh-huh
yeah a swapable front or whatever
yeah or just different colours would be uh i don't know if people also wanna spend more money on fronts for their uh remote control
well
for the remote control
it could be be yeah you never know but
why not
yeah
more money for us
but it and i think we have to make it quite big
yeah
quite big
yes definitely definitely
yeah you think
yeah people
that's to be uh a formed for your hand
so and and also because uh it is expensive
if you want it to be something you know it's ha doesn't have much functions want to be you don't want to get it l make it
yes it it it should be f be visible nearly anywhere in the room
as i uh as i said during my presentation fifty percent uh o
mm-hmm
and shou and should ni look nice when you put it on a table
i i think you m might wanna put it uh yeah that it it it it stands up
a standard or something
yeah
yeah you have to put it on its so it's like a vase or uh something you put on a table
a face
or uh yeah yeah
no no put stuff inside it
yeah
more like a joystick then
but it's like like a statue or something
yeah yeah i see what you mean yep
it's like you have uh four phones
yeah yeah but yeah but you also can put it somewhere near the window in
something like that
if you do that but i don't know if that's possible within the production cost of twelve and a half euros
that it's it's fashionable
i i don't
i in in the base we could like make uh a button and if you push it the remote control itself s makes noise
oh yeah
that's probably stupid but uh as i found here uh fifty percent was it fifty
but that's that's fun for the first time and then the second
uh fifty percent
fifty percent often loses remote control
yeah but but when you when it gets lost how can you press the button to make it
no uh of the base the the the the the the the thing you put it in
oh okay
on the television
oh like this
uh that's kind of nice
if an a button in in that uh
or you can
and then also you don't even need batteries because you can make it uh chargeable
a char chargeable
yeah you can ma make rechargeable one yeah
yeah
yeah
yeah that w yeah but yeah the pro no well i think that it might be t p well nee but we don't yeah
why not
why not
maybe you but we don't know much about production cost
but when you you can imagine that when you spend twenty five euros on a remote control and it's a basic remote control
with recharger
then the then the money there must be money to spend on that kind of st you know rechargeable units
it should only cost twelve and a half euros of course
aye
yeah but we would d ma we'd do it in taiwan and so it's not gonna be that expen
production
yeah okay
it should be possible
uh i i think it's a great idea
i think it's a good idea
yeah
s some kind of be i've never seen that before and you make it uh um be uh you see it with uh the mo the mouses nowadays
to make a base or something
yes
yes definitely
yeah
yes but is that handy
well i well it's really ch you can recharge it so you ha never have the battery problem
it's it's it's it's
that's one
and uh you can always find your remote control up
but but remote controls remote controls nowadays can can last uh two years three years with with t two batteries
it's not the purpose to be handy it's
uh okay
well maybe yeah you could when that's when it's too costly you could probably skip the recharger
and then you
but you will you do need uh also an uh also you would need a battery in the the base unit as well you know
does it makes it kinda
yes
well y you you could connect that to two hundred to twenty volts of course
or
mm
yeah yeah
i don't know
okay
yeah but that's not it's ugly i think
yeah
yeah but then it's very easy to make it also a rechargeab i don't think that is gonna cost much to make it also a recharge function in it
no
on the other hand if you don't do it we can also make a nice bay
i mean it looks trendy and still still put a bleep function in it but um i think the bay is definitely uh
yeah
i think it's a good idea
and make it you know we we um
well we uh it's it isn't a t a most uh costly uh remote control
we can save on the on the functions
we just put some simple button in make it big and sturdy nothing more and just make s sure there's some noise that it can make
or probably some kind of cheap light thing around it or that it uh that it lights up it's also nice
sure why not
yep
and if you put it away i think it's uh w we have to we uh that's uh it's not a easy market
yeah
yeah
we have to something special
yeah
and for twenty five euros people want something remote c special from your mote control
true
yeah
and we can't deliver that in r with uh regards to the functions because we aren't gonna put
definitely
with eye candy ear candy whatever
yeah
yeah definitely
and then uh when make it you know nice looking shape and this and then you also you got the stand up thing
yeah
i think i think it's a good idea
yeah
yeah it must be must be a gadget to have
yeah
definitely yeah
oh if it let's well we will see what's possible concerning the the costs and if it's possible we'll do that
yeah
and we even try to save up on other stuff to make sure we can do such a thing
and the first thing we the most likeable thing to to n to skip is then probably the recharge function or something
if that's too expensive we won't do that
yeah we c
but it would be nice
it would be nice yes
it's the idea
i know that batteries last long nowadays
and and what people just think about well i'll never have to buy any r batteries again
so y b because it's very annoying when your battery is empty
and you know then when you haven't batteries around and probably for two weeks your remo i've experienced that that
most televisions break down before the battery pack is empty so yes
yeah okay
so easy functions
well we will we will i think we'll work that out zapping numbers on it bi
or just give a beep when the battery's out or uh down
yeah why not
yeah
but it's also annoying
'cause as long as it stays as it ke keeps working you're not very motivated to do something about it
hmm
yeah
true
then it beeps all the time and
no that's true
you don't want to have ever have those problems and you won't have if if you have the rechargeable
and you don't have to use the unit you can also put it on the side if people don't like it
uh i i in the in the ma yeah but it w i mean
why not
but you pay for it
if if they pay for it because they think oh that's a great idea i'm gonna use it
and when it you know when time goes by and they think well i'll never put him in the recharger
i think last long enough then they put it on side and they can use it now and then
then when they look get m i i i know for sure that everybody who buys this remote control
within a couple of months of they will be in the situation that they they're seeking for the remote control
they wanna see something quick and uh just push the button and th uh i think it's brilliant
yeah
bleep bleep bleep oh there it is yeah
yeah i've never it's so simple but i've never seen it
yeah
yeah
no
and you can leave it just there
nearly
m maybe we should really do this
yeah
yeah
okay now well how much time have we got left
these clocks aren't uh synched
yes
oh now i've put uh well it is twenty p okay so we have ten minutes or something
yeah i'll
something like that yeah
yeah but we're uh we're done
uh fifteen minutes
i think
we've decided on the functions
well there is some oh
there is a closing sheet
we have lunch break and then we have thirty minutes of individual work
oh
oh okay i'll make sure i'll i had some problems with uh the digitising the the first minutes
the the s the next minutes won't be a problem
but i'll try to make sure the first one will be in the folder too but maybe it won't work but you'll see
we'll see
i think these are more important than the first ones so
can you make an uh uh
a part of f folder for the minutes maybe
that not not everything in one one uh folder
maarten five minutes
oh five minutes
yeah because uh i i d i did uh the first minutes i did were were were a bit scratchy you know
then i did a s second one with a nicer layout which i could uh know
use for the other ones well but uh i d think uh i forgot to do put done under the first one
and when you go write a second uh it's get it's not working when you try to write second uh paper or something
yeah
maybe
no that's true uh yeah
and then you you had to overwrite it or someth i don't know
becau i d uh it was not my uh pen
should we by the way draw um
this kind of looks you like
on our nice whiteboard um a little uh idea of yeah
of the shape
or the sh
yeah probably it would be nice
i dunno
has anyone got um a little bit detailed ideas about the shape
do you get an idea of the shape
i don't for one
maybe like this pen
a bit bigger i guess but
no bigger
a little bit bigger yeah but
the shape is nice it's um
something different and we want we want that
it has to feel nice in your hand
well i i i have to say i have this uh can opening remote control in my head most of all
yeah
or i think some maybe we should no that will be too costly
oh uh look uh look at the pictures
we shou we could also that was a would also be an idea but i don't think it i don't know if it exists already
you should like make alessi or something design it
okay yeah
that would also be nice
but that's gonna then you c then you don't
yeah but twelve and a half euros
uh
yeah but then you don't have t yeah it that's not something i that's in the production cost a one it's a one time
you know s was it's a single cost
yeah
yeah m but but then you can nah i don't thin i think that it would be more expensive
because i've bought the alessi stuff more often and even small pencil holders or something are more expensive
yeah that's true
would be a nice idea though
i don't know
i think it uh has to be a r it has to have round forms or something
like something like that or so or so
something like that is very ergonomic
and on th and then uh s a base unit underneath it
so
it's also round
put it in there uh wire on it
yeah
maybe uh i don't know some some lights a big but well
yeah flash lights at the side
volume and programme yeah
at the side or something like that
yes volume and programme should be there i guess because you hands wi uh y your hands will be in the smaller part
and some of the extra funct
some of the extra functions over here
yeah
yeah and the numbers on top i guess
numbers
yeah
and and lights
how we're g well maybe uh s a ring of no no you have to maybe on the side of it
maybe ro roun rounds uh uh l sorry
yeah side of it
along the side uh strip of yeah
just two leds or something on the side
maybe lights also around the volume and the p the plus minus programme buttons
yeah
yeah but i also meant the the blinking li w you know the ones that also blink when you try to uh uh locate your remote
oh
okay
yeah
yeah
well theys have to be
well uh probably at the side
you know look at the front but
yeah
yeah yeah
exactly
when you you see it from the side then it would look just like that
yeah exactly and then there is yeah
and then you have
a strip of uh lights or something
yeah something like that yeah
okay yeah
well uh i think it's nice for one thing
maybe put something on top of it or you know like that's looks funny
no
i don't know
no
or some bump
i think i think that'll be too big tha too big then
maybe some yeah
bumper or something
we'll have to think about it
i think we're we're done
yeah
yeah
yes we are
we can save this one
alright
lunch break
yes i guess it's lunch time
okay then
mm mm
i don't know
half and hour
i thought our next uh next individual round was half an hour
okay five uh
yeah that was what uh
i don't know about the lunch break
mm we'll hear about it
well
oh
okay all set
welcome to the conceptual design meeting
uh okay
yes
the agenda
the opening
i'll again be the secretary and make minutes take minutes uh and it will be three presentations just like the last meeting
so um who wants to start off
technical uh designer again
again
okay
hmm
uh yeah
uh before we begin it i want to say i've i've put the minutes of the uh second meeting in the shared folder
but they're still not uh quite okay
it uh it uh still some technical difficulties so the the first part of the minutes are very hard to read
mm-hmm
because there are two documents that uh were layered over each other
okay
so but uh from now on i won't use my pen anymore so will be p just ordinary keyboard
uh may be better yeah
keyboard work
i think it will
yeah
will be more uh easy for you to read the minutes
yeah
alright
okay when we talk about uh components design
um it's really about the material and the and uh uh really the stuff we build uh the remote controls of
um a remote control consist of uh components and the components of a remote control consist of uh properties and material
we have to choose th uh these uh wisely and it could affect uh uh a kind of grow of in uh in buying uh the remote controls
um the components of a remote control are of course uh the case
uh the properties of the case
um it has to be solid uh in hard material like uh hard plastic uh with soft rubber for uh falling and and uh uh yeah
it feels uh good in your hand
mm the buttons has to be uh solid too and the material is soft rubber
uh i've got a uh email from the possibilities of real reaction
um
uh they're telling me that um when we build uh a remote control of um of plastic or rubber the uh buttons have to be uh rubber too
mm
it's okay
yeah
i when we use a rubbled a doubled curved case
we must use a rubber push buttons to uh the the rubber double curved case is a is a t uh three dimensional uh curve in the in the design
which is uh necessary when we want to be trendy
uh
um
oh
the energy source uh i've got a lot of possibilities for that too
um
uh the basic battery which i thi prefer because of its uh its non uh non depending of of of uh um
uh here you have to have a hand uh yeah kinetic uh
energy
also in uh this one like in the watches but a remote control can lie on a table for a day
and then you push uh a button and so you don't have to uh walk with it all the all the time
mm solar cells are also uh a bit weird for uh remote controls
um
uh also the case material uh i think that plastic is the is the best with rubber because uh wood or titanium
would also be a bit weird
oh titanium is
probably trendy i think
that's true i guess
yeah
well maybe a little bit expensive
i don't know
huh
uh they don't tell anything about the cost of uh titanium
um
the chip uh the chip set uh and the board is uh all off the shelf
also the speaker in the remote control when we want to retrieve it
um the base station is also off the shelf all the materials and the
components are uh just available in uh
in our uh factory
mm
i've told about uh the three first points
mm the simple electronical chip uh is is available uh with the led transmitter uh transmitter
uh it's all uh off the shelf and even the speaker and the wireless retriever are all uh available in our company
um another possibility
i uh
yeah i looked up on was uh the l. c. d. displays
could be uh
something special to our uh remote control and it's possible but it only cost a bit more
but maybe it can be uh within the limits of twenty five euros
twelve and a half
ah yeah
actually
yeah
yeah production cost
i th i got an email with uh some examples and it these were were the most trendiest one
you see uh a covers which can be
what are those t tooth uh brushes or so
um i don't know
um
but it's actually kind of uh well it resembles the design i had in mind for this proj you know the the cartoonish alessi kind of design
i
yes
yep
yes maybe we can uh bri uh bring a couple of uh couple of types of uh maybe a kind of uh whole uh
and we can we can steal their ideas
um
a whole set of uh different uh remote controls
maybe we can bring a whole line uh with uh
huh
with a huge variety of uh
well it's a possibility too
uh house uh stuff
different colours also
like uh maybe radios and uh television also uh in this in this in the same style but
uh uh
yeah that'll be for the future i guess
okay
yeah
yes because we have to uh we have to we have to bring the logo and all the stuff uh back into it
next time we're here
yeah
oh okay
yeah
definitely
okay
okay
thank you
alright
uh
yeah
that's okay
ah
well i shall go to the next slide
um
um i still don't have any information about user requirements
i was thinking about just uh the basic functions and i got uh
oh we decided upon that in the last meeting
yeah but but then wh i don't know when there are new user requirements
didn't we
oh okay
i ha i ha i have the i have
well tha i didn't receive any new requirements or somethi just no but we decided to use only b basic functions only
nothing
well i have here a couple of basic functions i could think of
okay
i dunno if they're maybe a little bit more but
well we maybe we can think of that later
yeah
w just these are the ones you already summed up in the
yeah i i uh well i pointed them out here just to make it a little bit easier
okay
um
another function uh is of course we already discuss it on the side
um i don't know what costs of it
uh i've no idea about it
uh i was also looking for what you said for i got an email uh uh about uh l. c. d. in in in front of the remote control
i don't know if that's a good idea or maybe it's a little bit
too much for twelve and a half
production
yeah
uh-huh
if we got already uh something like a base
that might get redundant also maybe
i don't know what kind of information it would
yeah i don't know
i d i uh ju i was just thinking about it
mm yeah
then i got a pop ups to go to the meeting
yeah
yeah it's okay
maybe we can bring t uh uh teletext to the t to the remote control
but
the remote control
then you and then you've got a flag s very big r. c.
a little uh too a little bit
okay
that's not
yeah
a little bit too big i think
it was not a good idea
exactly
okay
um yeah
well the functions are are not more to discuss i think
no
it's it's just the base things we already discussed that the no v. c. r. or that kind of uh so that's very easy
no
no
um
but you do mention the next and previous uh button
mm-hmm
next channel previous channel
well that's next channel
oh okay o okay okay
i mean next channel
uh
um oh i i got an email with with an uh a remote control with a base
huh
so it's uh just an idea
and i um
uh thinked of the button sizes and i'm not sure uh if they have to be big or uh just small
but you're the expert
i think it depends on the function
well i'm not a e i'm the expert for user friendly but not for trendiness
mm-hmm
maybe it
well if you save uh perhaps uh s tiny buttons aren't user friendly then we wouldn't im implement that of course
well uh okay that's your point
um yeah
yeah okay
yeah i've nothing to s
well w when we only use basic functions we have the possibility to make the buttons larger
oh that's right
uh with a little bit larger yeah
yeah
i thought so but maybe with the
well i think we already agreed upon the fact that the the the skip buttons and the cha and the volume buttons
th th those two have yeah they have to be large
yeah that groups
uh i mean th th the the two two basic buttons you know the to skip channels and to uh
large
yeah
yep
i think yeah i don't know why but i think that is that's t trendy too because that's the mo it it you know
most the most used uh buttons
those are probably the the th
it's uh acc acc um accentu uh how do you say it
it puts an extra accent on the the on the simplicity of our remotes to j to make these two most basic functions extra big like t
yes
true
yeah
those are probably the b four most most used buttons on the th in the remote control
yeah
you did the research
and you want to acc accentuate that you know
yeah
it's from your research
sorry
yeah sure
so
okay
uh that was all y uh personal preference i didn't have
i didn't had any time left
okay
so yeah
no uh that's coo it's cool
you don't care
no sorry
yeah
oh
go away
come on
it's there
yeah click on it
couple time
oh great
well i've done some research again about trends on the internet
um i've done some investigation and uh well
i uh got some information from fashion watchers from paris and uh milan
some uh some findings the most important thing is fancy look and feel of the remote control
uh well we were going to imply that so that's nice
the second important thing is uh innovative technology in the r. c.
uh our market really likes really likes that
and uh the third point there in this uh order if of importance the third point is a high ease of use
and uh well for the idea i've put some trends uh for the market of elderly people
dark colours simple recognisable shapes
so we probably won't do that
the younger market likes uh well the themes of of this year are uh surprisingly fruits and vegetables and spongy material
i found this image which is uh well it symbolises the idea of fruits and vegetables
i don't see the spongy part in it
but with a little bit of fancy
well maybe c then we have to do something with sponge bob then
exactly
i got some ideas uh well yeah pictures isn't really good word but um
some symbols of fruits or vegetables maybe
uh catchy colours
fruit is uh yellow green red whatever
so remote controls in in catchy colours
it doesn't stroke with the with the dark colours
uh no we don't want dark colours
not the dark colours
okay
no i just put them there to uh yeah uh for general idea
okay
and uh the docking st uh i think the spongy material is is very irritating for the uh remote control itself
but to
yeah the to implement some spongy thing maybe we can do it in the in the docking station
at the bottom of the docking station or whatever
and uh we could bring one line with a dark colour uh to um uh p uh yeah uh uh v how do you say
for diversity or something
yeah also a bit for elderly people who are a little bit crazy and want maybe want a little younger design but still the dark colour
uh
well how uh
i mean it it it reaches a different market uh
but it it it doesn't cost really much effort to b to uh bring uh like a black r. c. on the market or whatever
yes
but how do we use uh fruits and vegetables in christ's sake with remote control
no but i i i think that uh our design already resembles so a piece of fruit
yeah there's there's always a
uh make it a banana
it's like a pear or something
well there there's always empty space of course on a remote control
i mean i think this part of the r. c. uh well the upper the upper part or whatever is uh is not not used with buttons i guess
no i don't think you have to do it like
so you you can put some fruity things
yeah but it that doesn't have to remind you you know like explicitly of s our f of a of a specific piece of fruit
no of course not
but just you know like the the the the round curves
and so y i i think this y it already sem resembles uh something like a pear to me or something
especially i
yeah but th yeah but that
yeah yeah
yeah exactly
yeah but that's
if we make it little bit greenish
yeah
you do get the idea eh
the fruity kind of round 'kay
yeah uh uh
a and we could use one of these for the uh w what is it
yeah uh yeah i don't know
grapes
uh
isn't
uh this is a b yeah
wha whatever
but d don't we need a creative artist or something like that to m make it to feel like a a a a vegetable or fruit
yeah yeah
of course we have uh
yeah sure
yeah
we have a very big uh the s
well w we can uh w we can we can produce multiple uh multiple things
for a big team of artists
of d design team yeah
this is then the uh pear
i don't know the english word so forget it
yeah but
it's pear i guess
and um maybe yeah a b a banana is uh is n not easy for a remote control but m yeah
but uh but i think we don't have to make
we can't make all uh ten designs
no
we have to make one design i th i i think
no but i think it's it's already what we were were up to
mayb maybe two or three
yeah
uh it's it doesn't have to resemble uh what i already said
yeah
a specific piece of fruit but just you know like a fruity thing going on
no sure but but
b but that's great and and and what i was what what i was saying the catchy colours
and it's it looks fruity to me
and uh but i do like the yeah i do like uh the f uh to the idea of making a a y uh
a catchy colour design and a d because i do i think a dark colour would be nice too
yeah
but pictures of fruit vegetables vegetables
maybe it's too much you know
but we we have to um there have to be the the the the firm colours our own uh colours has to be in it
yeah uh not really
pictures was a was a bad word but
okay but what are the this is yellow
well we c yeah
yellow a real reaction
yes you can put a logo on top of it
yeah sure
but i don't think our our company colours are this fashionable
uh yeah
maybe we can if if we got our docking station over here
we uh f
yes it's really fruity
i can't draw with this thing but i'll try
a yellow do
if this is our docking station we can make our logo over here
uh yeah
it doesn't work
and then
yeah and the button then
with a strawberry on top
yeah on uh n uh on the bottom of the remote you can do
well the button button over here or whatever i don't know
okay yeah
on the front of course because else you can't find it
okay
well that were my ideas a little bit
i'll close 'em down
okay
um go away
okay you can you open the conceptual design presentation
conceptual design yes
see what was on the agenda
lazy
the agenda
this is his own remote
because um maybe we can start with the technical uh functions
yeah
but i don't think it's there uh yeah um do we want to um use an l. c. d. display for example
well it's nice of course
only if we
but i don't i don't know what to display on it
me neither
maybe maybe we can make a t. v. guide on it for the channel you're on
i mean
yeah but it should be li like this big and i don't think
yeah but it's so
no no only the t. v. channel with the with uh with uh four programmes
i don't think we should do it
you can uh zap through them with the page up page down button
yes sure
but it it has to to show an entire title of a programme or at least a q a quite quite large part of it and then you get a very large l. c. d. screen
yes it can
on your
no on your mobile phone you can y you can read text also
because
so why not on your remote
yeah but no
yeah i don't know
i do i think it's a bit redundant actually
and it's also not i don't th even think it it looks s like sexy or something it's
well well what would you display on it then
uh programme uh information or or or or g or a guide
programme information
but is it isn't that a already on t. v. a lot of new t. v. s
but
on t on teletext yes
also on the internet
well a lot a lot of t. v. s indeed show uh when you uh zap to a
but
but you're already watching the t. v. you're not gonna watch your remote control
yeah
yes but you also want to know what's next
but then we also uh w need to bring out a line of t. v. s which we were planning to but whatever
yeah and we also have to yeah
because the t. v. has to send information back to the r. c. and i don't know if that's possible
yes that's uh really possible
yes yes o of course it's possible but you gotta uh implement it in the t. v. s
and i don't think everyone's gonna buy a real reaction t. v. within a month after the release of our uh remote control
and i also
i really understand you want to make your job more exciting by putting an l. c. d. in it
but i i really don't think it's a good n goo because it also doesn't stroke with we wanted uh c when we talk about the materials
uh it's a good idea to use these plastic materials with soft rubber stuff on it
it was our idea you know to give it a more sturdy look and that you ca like you can throw with it
yeah
but i don't think a l. c. d. display fits in that image
you know it's like more vulnerable and it adds nothing really you know
that's true that's true it breaks f yeah it it it's not very solid it's uh frag fragile
yeah yeah
you could make it but it's just it it doesn't i don't think it it's coherent with the design we're after
no
no
i don't think so ei either
but that's my opinion
well you you y okay we can vote for it
you want the l. c. d. display
no
i don't want to and he doesn't so it's up to him
ah
if we wanna
yeah i dunno
and i've read somewhere that i've got some kind of veto veto uh rights
oh okay
bastard
so i can also say
we can you away
but did we skip the yeah you could do m but what what i so what i but do you think we should
yeah i don't know
uh uh i i if it's it's a simple p
we're not even sure what what information we want to display on it
no that that's right and uh i also have to think about new functions maybe buttons or something like that to control it
no uh um
so
kind of l. c. d. or something or
y yes you can use uh buttons uh uh w that are already uh on the remote control for double functions
yeah i guess
but how does it display then
w when i go to the second channel what what does it show me
uh then you push a button
the title and the information about the programme
about that programme
but but uh yeah what he said was right about the televisions they have to be uh customised to the
nah that's not gonna work
but maybe in future it will be a giant hit and when you are the first
no
yeah
you have the biggest uh
oh well uh i've seen it done before
do you know th like the the bigger rem uh universal remotes they have d l. c. d. displays
yeah
but then it's very functional to indicate which what uh uh device you are controlling
so it's that that's what i've seen
yeah that's true if you uh yeah
yes you can put uh a little l. c. d. display on it with uh with lots of information
but it just it j it doesn't doesn't match with the our whole basic concept
but uh i haven't thought about it
but whe but when you put a a a transparent uh plastic uh
uh screen on top of it it i it isn't vulnerable
well yeah yeah okay
you can throw with it and
that's maybe not the most important but it's just
is it fashion
when when you put uh maybe a colour l. c. d. t uh screen on it it's very special and very trendy to have uh a remote control from
i don't think so
i don't know
that's not up to you
that's up to market if i if it's trendy
yeah well do you ha do you have to you haven't looked after the trendiness of l. c. d. displays have you
no
because our our motto is we put fashion
well i think it's uh i think it's pretty trendy to be honest
uh but um i don't know if if if well i'm coming back to the costs again
but i think uh we gotta build a b pretty cheap design to to stay within our limits
and i think uh especially colour l. c. d. which is indeed pretty trendy
but i don't think uh i think it will be too expensive
but uh i've got a the email with uh with the possibilities
and l. c. d. was a possibility for the remote control
yeah yeah yeah
so why don't we use it
uh did it say a price also uh for for uh monogramme uh l. c. d. or uh coloured l. c. d.
yeah but we're gonna if it
yeah if you want to be trendy you have to be coloured
coloured
yeah really if y if you c i
if you have black and white or something or grey that's
i in in two thousand and four you can't uh put something on the market which is a monogramme
then uh then you better don't yeah d
really
no but it doesn't sa say anything about a colour or but mm
i alf i also got a possibility to put uh a scroll button on it
but
uh uh i really don't feel the whole idea of an l. c. d. display
i didn't think that
i'm sorry
it can't co you cannot convince me
i don't know how well how to with you guys but
i don't really feel it
we already we're uh yeah we already have the the th th th base station gadgets
it's too much uh maybe uh with with the l. c. d. and the docking station and
yeah
and want and it uh uh do it has to be a simple design which sturdy which soft
yes but o on the
w we've we've gotta find a balance of course
with one thing special
and i think
not a whole package of specialty
i don't think
i j uh and really i don't see how the the l. c. d. display is gonna add anything you know on a design level
uh i think it's slicker to have no l. ceds
no when y
y we want to it's simplicity
but it look
w you have two big buttons and you can do whatever you want with these two buttons so you don't need an l. c. d.
yes but that remote controls are already on the market
it doesn't fit in our philosophy uh behind the whole remote
the simple
yes but but when you want to have something special
yeah but we already have the docking station which is
yes but you had a picture of it from another company
we have a pear
and uh the
it has to be developed but no but it that's that's our that's our killer feature
yeah
it's just an it's just an idea
that's our what makes it special
it's a it's
yes it was already made
tha the remote control on the docking station
yeah we're gonna develop our own r n docking station
true
is that so
was it it wasn't just a prototype
yes he have a picture of it
well uh i uh
yeah i dunno
exactly i've never seen it in a store
uh but re we really have to cut this off
i re i know you i i i i i get the idea you really like it you know
the the l. c. d. thing but i i think it's it's not a good idea and we have already mentioned all the arguments
i don't uh do you guys agre how do you guys think
i d
no it's too much
i think it's a little too much yeah
it's overdone
okay we s skip the l. c. d. display
okay
okay
i'm sorry maybe you can do something if we are at your own place or make it make it make it happen in your basement or something
democratically
no
mayb
i will rule the world with it
but
probably so
yeah yeah yeah yeah
okay
but for the technical part
the m material i think uh it was a good idea to use the plastic and uh the rubber
yes maybe a bit of a cushion is
uh
yeah yeah yeah p exactly
this is what it w yeah but it it was already what we're uh we're after
yeah for the spongy uh feel
yes
with a spongy bob feel
yeah
you know to give it uh you know the soft touch in your hands and also to
yeah
know like yeah that is y the b airbag kind of thing
like a b yes
you can st throw it at your little brother's head
yeah airbag
yeah you just can drop it
yeah
if you drop it if you drop it the airbag comes out yeah
yeah
yeah
no no no not that comfy
maybe it but then we have to look that it uh w uh will not um be too childish to see
yeah yeah
yeah
okay that's a that's a good point
and that's why i like the dark t col dark colour bit you know
yeah
because it may be the design uh it's uh maybe it is a bit of the
but not black i think
it's a bit nineties maybe what we're what we're up to rat fun to this point
no
well if if it's fruit and vegetables it have to be colourful
yeah that's that's true but but it has to be a little big solid
yeah b yeah that's what w i i was pointing at
but can we ge uh uh
it mustn't be too n you know th too overwhelming then when you put it on your just
can we combine it or something
uh with uh yellow and black
yeah
yeah maybe so
make it a bee
what
a bee
oh a bee
oh
no uh i don't like the yellow and black combination
but it is our company colours
yes real real good colours
apparently
yeah it's our yeah
yeah
we we have to use yellow
hmm
hmm
i don't like yellow and uh maybe i don't know
well we can as as i
but that's not really fruity
draw really nicely over there
we can put the logo on our uh on our base station
uh yeah
and maybe very very tiny on the remote control itself
but
but i
okay but what uh what are other tef technical things we have to discuss
uh fronts
of the
we can have uh different uh uh fronts of the
should we do that
telephone
i don't think you we should do that
maybe just bring it out in different colours but not af that you can switch fronts afterwards that's also too much
different fronts
yeah
i guess that's that's enough
people don't wanna spend more money on their remote control i guess
that's way too nokia
yeah
uh you can you can l uh let choose the customer which colour he wants yeah
are these designs
yeah yeah
yeah definitely
yeah three three or four uh four uh colours or something like that
just bring more designs on the market
but uh without gon uh okay
why not yeah
so are we through the technical part then
yes
okay
so we uh agreed upon uh n uh well not u unanimously or how you call it but yeah
it this a real uh young young and dynamic uh uh styles
well yeah the
three to one
that's
the materials you uh mentioned in your your personal preferences were all were quite okay
yes
o o only only the last point your no titanium's not not out of question i guess
and tita uh titanium is uh is is it a no
yes
is
but also w
it's just like that th this titanium
yes b bu but when we use s soft
but is it possible to use both the the plastic and so uh soft things and t p titanium as well
mm
sure
makes it in a homogeneous uh design
mm
no not all not all of them
but it it then it uh you can't throw it it
it will uh make a huge noise or break other stuff
when you throw with uh titanium with your remote control
it will it will break other stuff w when it's plastic as well
no uh
yeah
titanium is a bit uh it's a bit harder
yeah that's true
no but uh uh you should ma yeah
but also on the colours the young
okay think of the possibilities and make it in completely titanium
well would it be more trendy
more chic
yeah i think it i think it does
uh i think titanium nowadays is way more often used than plastic
yes but a titanium remote control when you're uh watching t. v. uh or your hands are a little bit sweaty and the
in trendy things
yeah o
on the other hand if you want to make fruit fruity stuff with uh
yeah
it's cold in the winter
yes
yeah but i i really like the idea of the the the plastic and the big kind of thing
yeah
but the question is i then it's you know
is is it fits in our s philosophy to make it uh sturdy and simple and uh know like uh
yeah that's true that's true
sports and gaming
when you make it titanium it becomes more like some kind of gadget you actually don't need
define
and when it's big and plastic it's like some fun stuff you can always have around
it's always fun to have something big and plastic around
yes
you have that uh m. p. three player of nike i saw
yeah
isn't that titanium with a little bit of rubber
yes it's w but it is uh plastic
isn't it
is plastic
well it's titanium looking
yes w we can do that on the on the
what
yeah he is
here he is
uh the i don't know if you know the m. p. three player of nike
'kay uh that that's very uh with rubber so it's very
oh yeah
okay yeah
yeah that's beautiful
yeah i see
we can make this as a style too
yeah but but but
rough
uh this is uh just a
oh maybe th maybe this is an
yeah i th i think that's difficult because uh that's different material and then you gotta have like uh uh uh two material lines of of of
no we c we can make it from the same kind of plastic
yeah if it's just a colour uh which you uh which you change then i guess it's it's nice to have one of these
uh
uh
no i do like the idea of maybe a t titanium kind type of body w and then with s plastic colouration around it
you know like the the soft stuff but i don't know if it's possible
yeah
i don't have the information
uh i i didn't got it
but you can't make the plastic give uh the ti titanium look
true
yes
but make it just like shiny
mm-hmm
yeah yeah true
maybe we should uh shou
like the m. p. three player
yeah maybe that's good idea yeah
but if you want to la uh yeah last longer than two weeks or something like that you can maybe
yeah
and uh and
maybe we sh should we t i don't know if we should talk about uh how how much time have we got left
uh in a lot of other uh
i don't know
what time does
forty minutes
in a lot of other product uh categories like uh even in b in bags industry
uh they began with uh t typical uh leather bags but then they became stylish
with all all si all sort of colours and w kind of fon of uh of fronts like we can use on the telephone and it
yeah
okay
like eastpack uh began a revolution with it with all this uh kind of bags and and colours and and
you putting in different colours
yes and and styles
okay
they have uh also uh a kind of uh um
uh roses on it a and uh
uh yeah yeah
okay
yeah but w yeah
well it is
it's a possibility
but let's think about the bas
then we can always uh use the same design for a greater resemblance but with new uh with new colours new yes
yes
new prints on it
mm-hmm mm-hmm
yep
but wha th our basic idea y i mean you gonna we're probably gonna have like two type of materials
like the d d b the plastic uh enclosure and then the the pads that surround it
and and pro and lights
we have to incorporate the lights too
but uh do w gonna gonna are we going to give it a two tone colour look
like the the plastic mould is in in one colour and the s the cushion pads around it are in another colour
is that the idea
is that a good idea
how do you mean
th th the uh base in a in another
the rubber
how many colours are we how many colours are we gonna we're uh uh f uh f only five minutes left by the way
yes
how many colours are we gonna give it
like two tone colour
there there are three uh components three components type
t
yeah
uh no not too much i think
you have the buttons the the case uh itself and the rubber and th
how the buttons yeah
i think maybe the case itself should be in one colour and then the rubber of the buttons and the cushions as well should be in another colour
yes
or you just make uh one colour uh maybe with a a z a kind of like a big wave or something like uh
yeah
okay but not more than well yeah it's no
in in another colour
not more than two colours i think
no definitely not
it's a g a little bit too flashy
maybe we should talk about it on a l in a later meeting
yes definitely
yeah or or when you use the buttons as black it you can use two colours as well uh
okay
but we have to uh think of some other uh important things
uh oh yeah the the functionalities of the the buttons
the funct yeah i was i was thinking about th the st do we still want a joystick idea
no
no i think that's too vulnerable
yeah
i think this is okay the so we have the basic
then we have the numbers
we have the power button
we have we have a teletext button
the volume teletext and
and maybe want to access a a menu or something
yeah but that's that's i was thinking that's gotta be on the television
most t. v. s have a menu
yeah but i think you ha i really need a menu button
yeah yeah yeah yeah b
that's just i the only button only
yeah but wha what kind of menu
you know i
is uh isn't that different from every television
no i think most t. v. s have an uh a menu nowadays to access the uh uh screen settings
mm
yeah if it's c if
and so
yeah i think it's okay to to add a menu button for uh and if the t. v. doesn't have a menu then
but that that covers all the all the other settings
it covers everything then
but then you have to put uh up and down and uh left and right
yeah
yeah you can put that on the two eight four and six or whatever
no you can use the
and you al can also use the normal skip buttons for that
okay
th in that way we have like only the numbers the power button skip and volume and then uh uh ten uh rem uh yeah mute
mm yeah
a mute and a teletext and a menu
mute
a teletext and a menu and then then i that's it
that's all
it's all we need
yeah
hmm
okay uh another stuf some stuff about the the the design of the docking station
great
yeah
okay that's not mu not much functions
so
something important about a s uh no uh which sh uh should remind us of the remote itself i guess
yeah definitely
uh in one colour
are we gonna do something with the uh spongy thing there
just use
i think the spongy thing already um comes forward in the in the in the cushions pads and things on the s uh side
uh
yeah that's true that's true
and we will make it spongy and and uh and uh well
the fruity thing is just the shape should be fru i did i think this is kind of fruity you know
just round shapes with uh
yeah it's kinda fruity and with th with catchy colours uh uh w
yeah but we're gonna have to we really have to think i think colours is very important because it has to be flashy
but and but it d it doesn't have to be annoying that when you uh know some things is just over the top
and when you have it on your table for more than two weeks you it just gets annoying because it's so big and flashy
yeah definitely
uh it has to be some level of subtlety but we have to still have to think of how we manage to uh
to get to that
yeah
okay
okay
guess we're through then
i guess so
okay
but we i think also we just so we have to do something with colour but also
i i think we have to keep the dark colour thing in mind
i think that's uh adds to the too much colour maybe m um
yes
yeah
too much colour i it uh when you got it in a living room it's too much maybe
but our des design experts will uh work that out
yea yeah
it has to be
okay well i think the meeting will be over within a minute
yep
yeah
so we will wrap up
something like that
or is there anything we'd like to discuss
i guess not
that's right
okay
do you guys
no
no
okay
well you will read the minutes uh in the you can find them in the pro probably
in the shared folder
oh okay yeah
yeah uh no for su for sure because i'm will now type them out
what are we going to do now
uh y yeah
you'll see in you email i guess
yeah
i think uh
yeah i don't know
i don't know
i hope so
and the other thing is that you don't have kind of prototype or something like that
you see a kinda prototype you can a little bit more uh
i will make one in the next uh twenty minutes
yeah
construct one yeah
but toilet paper roll and uh
with you laptop
yeah
okay
oh my god
alright shall we get back to work
yep
great
i was waiting for the l last message but
well you are
yeah
we're not
bastard
back to the pen
you lazy
mm yeah
okay welcome to the detailed design meeting
again i'm gonna take minutes
oh we're gonna have a prototype presentation first
uh who's gonna give the prototype presentation
you two guys
yes
okay
go ahead
coffee
'kay we've made a prototype
um we've got uh
uh our aspects from the last meeting
uh especially we looked at the form material and the colour
um we've uh drawn here the p prototype
the logo is uh
is uh
is pretty uh obvious to see on the on the remote control but
it is necessary when you want to build your uh company f to a level higher
um
our interface elements there are shown in the in the drawing
maybe you can uh point them uh
the functions
uh well the uh all the functions are discussed uh i think the most of the functions are uh uh obvious
uh it's a little bit
uh power button
uh then the the the nine uh channels
uh the volume uh
uh at the side and the other side is the programmes
and then we had uh just uh two buttons we place them in the middle uh the menu and for the teletext i thought that was th
oh no the the the mute button misses now
alright i
oh the mute button
do y do you did we want to have a m mute button
yeah
but uh that it's uh here then in the middle
yeah
alright and uh you gotta point out which is the volume um uh button and which is the programme button
huh
yes um
we've disc
well yeah mo uh mo yeah well most of them are right handed
yeah but you you gotta make it clear on the on
most of the users
yes y there there will be a p a little a little p. on that and a little uh yeah
yeah well i don't have time in uh anymore on the
yeah and a and a triangle on that
oh yeah just progr programme above i think
yes
next to that i kinda miss a zero actually
wait there's was one thing i wanted to ask
uh there are different ways for remote controls to uh do uh like
uh d i call it teens and twenties
uh y th th th the two numbers
yes
all n no that's um kinda dependent on the television
yeah true yeah
it's a television
yes
yeah but do we have do we need extra buttons for example some uh some have to
uh
i think
uh i think so
yes yes you have you have a lot of standard buttons that has to be uh on it
uh th with the one and a double uh uh yes
yeah i think you should add
zero
a cross or whatever
may maybe here
yeah but you don't you don't actually need them
yeah line
becau b l a lot of remote controls work that y when y that you when you fir you push the one first
yeah
then you have a couple of seconds no i don't think so
and then a second
no that's dependent on the television
yes you have televisions then you have to you know you have to uh press
i do know so
is it depending on television
nah i don't think so really because you have a i know some remote controls that don't have these buttons
yeah
but you still can know obviously you can still select the twenty uh a number in the twenty or in the ten
yes but but a lot uh
yes but uh uh no uh remote control nowadays are um they come with the television
or actually the other way around
but
no i think uh i really think it's n because you can when when you put a button on it with like one and uh then a dash
yeah
it's the same thing as when you just push the one
because it i it first gives you the functionality of that that uh separate button you also had to uh apply
yes but
yeah well but su if
some televisions don't accept uh that that
yeah because that's i it's for television
it's exact the same thing
no no but s
no no no
so some television respond differently
look if uh i i
no listen listen
when you push the button the remote control gives a signal
i in th in the first place it gives a signal which it would also send when you put a separate button on it
yes
yes that's true
the one with dash that signal gi and when y whe when you don't push another button on the remote control within five seconds
then the remote control gives a signal for channel one
yeah
true
no
i think it works that way really
no it it it works uh if you haven't got uh a special button for it uh if you push a one
then on your television there will appear a one and a a line which is an empty space
yeah but it's exact the same that w would appear when you put a separate button push a separate button
yes but some some old televisions uh you have to uh click on uh a special button
uh then you go to a a next level you can push two buttons
yeah but you don't underst uh you don't understand my point
yep
true
i think it's exact the same thing when y
you want
yes but some television don't support it
no but then they would a would also support that button because it's the same thing
but the ex
listen with that that's that special but button you're talking about eh
that's just a signal to recei ju they send a t signal to the v tv t. v. that they have to put a one in on your screen and a dash
which you can pu so you can uh still put another number on it
when you don't have that separate button and you push y one it's exactly the same thing
do y you the remote control gives that same signal as it would give when you only had
no s some some televisions need the input first uh and and you c
no a remote can
yeah
yes so they need no they need
but you give the input
you push the one
that's the same thing as the button with the one and it yes it it is
no that's not true
it's simply not true
think about it
it's simply not true
yeah
no but uh
you uh you can wai when you push the one you can show on the telly a one and just a dash
uh
and it's the same thing what happens and a g remote control gives another signal after five seconds that is just one
and then wait uh two uh seconds or something
no remote control doesn't give signal after five seconds
remote control is a stupid thing
if you push a button it sends it immediately to to the television
yeah that's true
yeah but i m uh but it's i i know for sure that some televisions that w th th the remote control supplied
yeah it
only ha has the c these buttons with a one and a dash and a two and a dash
but when you use a bu a n remote control that doesn't sport these buttons it still works
but okay we we'll impl
no definitely not
we'll discuss them in the usability lab
definitely not
no we'll apply them then for now
uh eva evaluation
i don't know uh i don't know if if it's it's necessary
yeah app just apply them next to the zero the one and the two
yeah
yeah i think so
yeah for now if we don't know for sure whether
okay
and the button for the scart uh audio video uh external input
yes
ach
yeah but okay
uh you can access that uh via zero and then minus i guess
what i said about uh the remote control sending another signal that that might not be true
yeah
yeah
but i still think i it it all t. v. s in some ways support it i don't know
no no
i think it's more c is m maybe we don't uh we both don't really understand how it i how it really works
but i think there's more to in than wha than what you just said
uh remote control sends one signal at one button uh press
i do think that uh m t. v. s support mur multiple kind of remote controls
uh some
n some televisions when when you want to go further than uh ten
m
th won't work wi with uh to have that special button
no you have to you have to uh give the television uh two or more signals
when you uh press one button you give one signal
and the older televisions need more signals to go a level higher
but
yep
okay well we'll see
when you make the technology that that it will uh give more signals
it could work but
just a basic idea of of of the most uh most y
most common uh and simple uh operations on the remote
okay
i kinda miss the docking station
yeah
yes
it's here on the
well it yeah uh there's nothing i think it's pretty basic
we came uh
the the there's no fu there's one there's one button that's wha there's there's there's one function and that's n the one button when you want to find it
yes
no nothing really trendy about it
but maybe we can maybe we can make the docking station uh uh a bit standard for for uh the other products we sell
the button
because real real reaction sells more products than only remote controls
yep
so maybe we can uh use the docking station for example uh m. p. three players or or uh
uh hearing devices
i think that's very difficult because of different shapes of uh uh devices
yes but when you put that same volt voltages on it
you can put uh when the when the when uh o the the the lowest part of it
yeah of course
when it's o the same as the other products you can put it all on the same uh
mm-hmm
well it it got it it has got to fit into the shape of course
yes but we can make
the technology and the voltage can be the same
that's uh that's true
but uh i if you all make the m having a bottom like this then they all fit
no we can make uh make the most lowest part all the same
yeah that's true but uh
when when the the recharger has a has a bit what points out we can place all on top of it
yes but uh i i g
just have to be big enough for the biggest
shouldn't it fall then
it isn't going to fall down
that's a bit uh yeah i think
no when you make it large enough no it it will not
but then it's a little bit
no but if if like this i'll i'll point it out
if you got uh a a a base a base like this i won't draw it really
but it's just an idea
if you got a base which is uh as big as this
but it's flat it's flat as as this so we can p make all the products as flat as this
you can
yeah sure but if you got if you got a tiny player it can
but i i i it's backwards
yes but when you make uh uh a bit of big
but it's it's backwards
it's leaning
it's leaning backwards i think in the in the docking station
yeah
uh wha what you could do if you uh from the bottom oh right help
that's text
but
uh you could make like a hole in it you know of uh in in the
yes little holer littler uh little products go deeper in it
yeah
that i that is possible yep
well let's ha let's talk about the docking station later because uh maybe we have we have to uh consider the docking station anyway
yeah sure you're right
because we have some uh cost issues still to come
yes
and uh uh
oh
but we have to look n i don't know
the f the look and feel would be great on this uh remote control
i don't like the colours
because uh you always uh will uh pick up the remote control in the in the smallest uh area
mm-hmm
yeah
then your uh left thumb of uh your right thumb is uh near the programme uh button
which is the most common used uh function and all the other buttons are available for your uh thumb
so it's it's it's really good design
okay
yeah
yes
alright
that's it
yes uh on the side uh there will be a strip of rubber
and in the middle uh there is uh a hard uh a hard material a bit hard plastic with a light uh behind it
the light
okay
and other lights
i think added lights are gonna be a problem too
yes we can make also n neon lights on it or or the buttons that can make uh light on it
no o on the on the front
yeah okay
maybe the uh the logo
yes
lights
but it will also uh uh use batteries and do we want to
yeah why not
of course
okay
mm
for now uh this is uh is good enough
okay
yeah what was uh on the
the all the aspects of the interface buttons were uh
okay but in the oh yeah the colour
because we're gonna use uh one colour for the the plastic enclosure and one colour for the rubber isn't it
yes
then we're gonna do the buttons in the i are we're gonna have rubber buttons
and they're be a they'll be in the same colour as the rubber on the side
yes
yeah
uh in the same colour as the side
yeah
yeah i think i think that'll be good
okay
yeah
and i think we should use a a darker colour for the um plastic and maybe some more m brighter and flashy stuff
yeah
yes maybe we can use on the on the lights on the side we can use uh uh multiple uh lights so it will uh
yes
yeah we'll talk about the lights later
yes
'cause i also don yeah it's depends on the costs and such
yep
yeah
but uh and we have to agree uh upon the exact colours but may i dunno if that's important but we'll talk about that later
okay for now this is this is okay
we will
um the next p y you gonna give a presentation too
uh i have to see the agenda
well uh yeah i i'm gonna do something right there yeah
no
detail design
we gotta do that on the right the most right most screen because the leftmost
evaluation criteria
yep that's me
okay
okay
alright
i will be needing that image so leave it please
um
go away
right we're gonna evaluate that design according to a few points
um we g the four of us are going to do that um together
i wanna have a colour over here come on
right the remote is not ugly a bit weird sentence but
the positive things has to be on the left so i said not ugly instead of ugly
uh what would you say we we gotta give points to uh to all of these to evaluate uh that design
and please forget the drawing skills of these guys
okay
the remote control is not ugly
how do you feel
yeah i think four maybe would be appropriate because it's
yeah maybe it really depends on taste
uh i mean it's kind of our design
it's so if maybe a lot of people find it really ugly you know o other people find it really cool
yes
yeah
background colour
i don't know or uh i don't know how you
how do you guys feel
i think i think the the fronts will give it a more uh uh uh less uglier uh side
casting
yeah
because you can uh make it in your own yes you can make it in your own uh
the different designs
yes
yeah
okay
more to your own personality or or house style
yeah but we d we didn't we're we're not planning to use fronts i believe
no not not fronts but different designs
with a colour a co a colours
no not fronts
different designs
yes
oh okay
and that's still uh uh yeah is is uh is a little personal touch i guess
different colours maybe yeah
okay but
oh maybe we should do three or something that w you know our
what
yeah wha wha what would you uh guys uh think
or forty
yeah
personally
personally
we can make it a one
yes but what is it
i think two or three
guido
mm yeah
i agree
two or three
um i uh i go for the positive
i was
so i go for two
i was thinking about three so i guess
uh i was thinking about four so i think three is uh
three is uh a bit uh oh what am i doing
okay three
i'll mark it
the remote control's uh uh that n makes uh zapping easy
yeah
yeah well let that let's make that a one
yes
two
yeah
one
one
antek you agree
yes
okay yeah i'll i'll agree
yes
yeah
that's one thing for sure
you're not antek
i'm the i'm the usability so
i totally agree
the remote control the remote control's relevant buttons are prominently visible
yes
yeah
yeah two or a one i guess
the
it's something we really put work into
yeah i yeah
i would say a one because uh every button is uh uh relevant
it's all about the buttons
and our oh yeah it's a b yeah
yeah
alright
that's a one
you agree
yeah
the remote control hasn't got too much redundant or unneeded buttons
i think we totally succeeded there
but
well
well maybe a two because of the menu button or something
oh
yeah well menu yeah maybe
yeah that's true
and telete
that's true
also the the the buttons of the one the two the the digits o they're used uh uh
yeah we don't know if the uh they're necessary
the the yeah m well you d you've got a point
i think a two
yeah true
can yes three two
yeah i agree
came a long way but not we didn't not uh
two or three
mm two
two
but you can't make a remote control without them because
antek
because we got
nay that that that's true that's true
they're definitely needed
no w w it can also always be more simplistic but two is yeah
so
we put it on a two
yes
the remote control has got a really trendy look
yes
a one
maarten
yeah uh a t i think a two
well
yeah yeah y i it's hard to say from this picture
yeah
we we've tried to make it uh the the best trendy look uh ever
yeah
ever yeah
guido
but i do think it's more
uh i will i will make it a three because uh yeah
i i th
but i do think that it's more trendy than beautiful
yeah uh i agree
yes
so so i think maybe it has to score higher uh on this than on the
i agree
yeah
true yeah
i was planning to give it a two uh where i give the not ugly uh oh yeah that's true
a th a three
you agree on the two
yeah
yes
i i uh when you compare to the
great
remote control hasn't got too much redundant or unneeded buttons
uh uh what's the difference with
uh i copied that one
well uh forget that
okay
um
go away
remote control has got innovative technology implanted
no
no
no
we're not well maybe the the the on the side
no not l. c. d. so
yeah but we uh you mean the rubber stuff
yeah and the light
yeah but we have t we have to talk about the lights uh
and the light maybe
but that that's not innovative
but
and i don't u also it's also really not innovative it's more
well i g
lights lights are
it's not seven
no six
well six
or seven maybe yeah
no six
six
or six
why uh why not a seven
six
yeah mine is seven
because we've tried to make it a little bit innovative but it but it
yeah
how
uh it's uh depends on the on the maybe
with the lights it it's it's kind of future
no i think i think actually it's a seven maybe but there's nothing innovative about it
yeah you think the lights are innovative
well it's n true
uh i agree m but
but still you can retrieve it when it's when it's gone with the with
innovative in generally or just f original for
i'll
yeah you you didn't draw the docking station
yes
n no no t
yeah it it's i think i think with its
the docking station is a is a little bit innovative
a docking station is innova
yeah i mean the dock station but but uh i think the the docking station it's gonna be a kind of a problem
it's a part of the remote
i think more m
okay
and with the speaker on the there's also a speaker
but
uh that that's n
well let's leave it open for uh for us later to see what because we have to reevaluate anyway
well i i yeah
okay
no
no uh well the agenda says evaluate now so i think we
okay for now it's a six or a seven uh sev six maybe because
it's it's a six
six
but the retrieval or the
that m f yeah for the retrieval function
yeah but i don't i don't know if it's very inno yeah
yeah
i think that's very innovative for a remote control
yes how would you innovate a remote control more
yeah v
yeah more through uh like function t. v. functionalities and no no you know what i mean
to put it on your head
you have must be innovative technology for remote controls but more in how you control stuff not in how you find your yeah
yeah sure but
yeah it's that's that's think about it la later on and uh
but i d i definitely don't think it's a five but
remote control is easy to use
yeah as a a one or a two ma uh at least
yes
yeah a two
yes
i think a two
yeah
yeah it's good
more two
come on
the remote control hasn't got uh
no i would have seen that one before
oh you skipped one uh
i've just filled uh
uh here
go away
you like the buttons
i found twelve questions so much but it still is ten
remote control will be bought by
it will be bought by people under the age of forty
yes
yeah
yes
definitely
in in and comparing with uh people of th of the age above
well
no no no
uh just in general
no just if they if they buy it
yeah a two
we don't know
but
yeah but i think i think two
yeah what do you think
yeah i think two yeah
i agree
antek
two
yes two but only in c when you compare it with with elderly
uh that is not the question
no that's no comparison
it's just w it will be bought by people under forty
yeah you can yeah you can be very picky about it
and i don't mean two people
this is just guessing
ah yeah just make it we'll make it a two
make it a two
w w
when it succeeds uh it can get a two mu
right the rem
the remote control has recognisable corporate image colour logo or slogan
oh no
yeah
yeah you have make an slogan is quite obvious
we don't have the slogan though
oh the slogan
oh the oh sorry no not not the slogan
can we see the slogan
the logo
yeah you can put that on the side if if we would like to
a logo
underneath it or something
yes uh encrypted uh with
yeah and i will i th still think it's gonna be a two or a three
are we gonna do that
a three
maybe a three this time
three
yeah a three
yes
three
i agree
because of the slogan remote control's got a basic design intended uh for novice users
and uh
uh it's a one or a two
yeah two
yes
two
yeah make it a two
two
two
alright
we gotta add up the scores now to see our total average
four five seven nine
forget that
fifteen seventeen twenty one twenty four twenty six
twenty six
it's a two point six
it's not that bad
alright we yeah
yeah and that's mostly the inno when we uh score higher on innovative technology we would score two
yeah
which is uh quite a great score
true
okay
uh this is was uh the evaluation
this was my evaluation
because i i still think that the most important part of this meeting still has
so
we did a pretty nice job until now
yeah
um is this your
is there something after this uh meeting
whatever
well i think we gotta fill out another questionnaire
or
no
okay
okay yeah
still opened or uh
yeah
yeah
okay finance
because um
shoot
i received uh a spreadsheet
a five
a five
yeah but i uh actually don't need this presentation i guess
oh
doesn't matter
i'm gonna open the spreadsheet and we're gonna work this out together because i didn't really fin uh i have a
didn't really finish it
well we uh we'll see
we'll stumble upon some problems
we probably will
i probably have already opened it here
try it again
first of all the mm all the docking station and costs and such are not included in this list
but let's let's st start with beginning
we include one battery
i i uh i'll explain its uh the the components are listed over here
uh price is given
we um yeah we we uh indicate the amount of components of the specif specific component how much we need of them
the amount yeah
and then uh we'll uh calcula don't watch the number yet
i don't know if it's filled in properly
okay we need one battery
one battery
i think one battery is enough
yes
we don't need kinetic solar cells hand dynamo
a s okay this this is a p first problem
uh i think
we should know how many
simple chips regular chips
uh it's it's one one chip but but you have to choose one from it
okay
but
the simple chip is e enough i i think but with the lights with the lights and the retrieval it can be uh
i don't know
where did we find this information
i haven't got an idea on on which we need to use really
was it
no uh i
i think it was uh your job in the first uh meet uh
no
f your first presentation to make this clear but then you had some t time problems
yes my my my uh
yeah
but do you th you do you know what chip we need
the the email i got said uh simple chip but when we put in the speaker and the retriever uh device
yeah
it will uh cost a a bit more like i think the advanced chip maybe
and how do you know
i mean you got that email
bec no the they didn't know about a retriever or a speaker uh in it
did it point out what to use them for
maybe you can uh look it up right now
okay but okay
when we don't when we leave the uh retriever and such aside what then it would be a simple chip
then it's a simple chip
and with the retriever it would be an advanced chip
yes i i i s i
alright well point out the advanced chip for now i guess
okay
that will be enough for future uh recommendations
yeah but it will it will it will be cause a lot of problems
the sample sensor sample speaker
what is it m is that the speaker we were t i don't know what it is
i don't know it uh either
i don't know
okay we went for the double curved case
yes
made out of plastic
and rubber
and with a special colour
i guess that's what we were
well special colour
yeah i don't know about the special colour but i think w uh
otherwise you get uh a standard uh plastic colour
i don't know if it's very special
i don't
yeah i think we uh we have special colours
mm okay
standard rubber
alright that's okay
okay then the push button i was just counting them
st
uh i think you have to indicate the amount of push buttons we want to use isn't it
whoa it's a little
yes
well that's bit of a problem because i re but i really don't understand that because i can imagine a remote control with far more push buttons
that's huge
and it wouldn't be possible according to this uh sheet
no
we have the simplest buttons
no
no it's only uh when you use push buttons it will cost that much
yeah
i don't think so because it says amount
if you use a scroll wheel
ah
yeah it wouldn't
the the the yellow row is the amount of
fill in the number of components you plan to use in the and the total cost i don't know
maybe it's the kind of push buttons
i
you can have f four kind of push buttons
rubber
uh one til nine
you can have uh
is that one or is that nine buttons
and i count them like this
one two three uh four five six seven eight nine ten eleven twelve and thirteen
yeah
because oh this is oh this is one okay
twelve okay then it would be eighteen because uh i uh rated them as uh um
to n that's total of four buttons
as uh uh uh separate buttons
different yes
yes
and plus these two f uh plus the mute button and it's will be uh eighteen
i think that
eighteen
one two three four five si
why is that so uh expensive
yeah i don't understand
y i do i don't get the point because it's would be
s relatively so expensive just these m small buttons
is it cents the the the fifty cents a button
fifty cents for one single stupid button
so whe when you so then it
no way
well okay well well let's make it just one
it's eighty percent of the price of the of the amount of
here now it's now it's already s shall we just
yeah exactly
yeah
give our own interpretation to because else we would really have a problem
it would be impossible to make it
i can't i i i couldn't understand it if it was fifty cents per uh uh per button
it's way
when you have the same amount of button you have to put in wi in your carton
really
board
and and less buttons than this isn't possible
yeah yeah
and then throw it
this is the most simple yeah it is possible but i've never seen one before
no no no
but whe
i've seen one uh one remote control with only the pu yeah only with uh page up page down and volume but but
no really
yeah without the numbers
that's possible
yeah uh
yeah we could skip the numbers
yeah but i d i wouldn't want to own that
really
that's still four
uh it's it's still for little children
they can handle that remote control but but it isn't fo
yeah
then uh teletext would also be im impossible
yes it's for it's li uh it's just for a little
yeah that's no option that's no option
okay we'll we'll just okay
but then still when we there's no room for a docking station or something
tha w le let's see th we have uh oh yeah button supplements
we'll give the buttons special colour
we'll give them a special form
uh i think we should mark the special form thing because it this will be some special forms incorporated in these big buttons i guess
a special colour why a special colour
because the buttons will be uh d will be matching colour between the buttons and the rubber surroundings
but wha what s what special
otherwise it
i think that's the what they mean by a special colour
okay yeah
otherwise it would be the
i don't think the special form is really true
uh yeah
i think all the special colour things have to be marked over here because that's what we were planning to do making it
special form also it says
yeah special material r also because i has rubber
is it
and the buttons have to be rubber
what is the normal material
yeah i dunno
plastic
sh yeah
plastic i think
classic
plastic
plastic
oh plastic
'kay but the problem now is that the
there's no such thing as a docking station in this list but we can all imagine that it would be impossible to make a docking station for thirty cents
yeah
but we can uh sell the remote control and uh sell the docking station yes
separately
se no no no
and and but we don't have to tell it
but what we can say of can um almost make it impossible to buy a remote control without the docking station
yeah yeah
yeah but i do like the idea but we yeah
it uh but it then the docking station isn't relevant for this project anymore
but we can but then you still have to use we have to find out what chip we u need
no
no but you otherwise you can't retrieve it
yeah i really don't get it
i mean if it's a simple chip then we suddenly got two euros and thirty cents
i think we can agree on this
i i think the special colour thing has to be uh marked
'cause i think we uh yeah i think that's what what what they uh mean
yeah yep
but for two euros and thirty cents we uh we don't get a docking station
i think so too
oh i don't know
but can we find out uh about uh this chips
because when we don't need a d a docking station then probably we also have only we also need a simple chip
and then we can get a docking station
and maybe then we can do something extra
for
oh n uh oh still oh it's gonna get more expensive with
two
then we have some money left
we can put then
for two euros
we can put a scroll wheel on it or something
uh why
yeah well who knows
i mean i i if you if it would cost two euros that had a total a total thing
or a little bit of tin titanium
it would be nice too i mean uh we're not gonna add uh a trip to hawaii to it
but what what can we do
yeah or we can ki do the kinetic cells
that's also maybe an idea
but uh what can we do with the simple chip and what's difference with a regular chip and a advanced chip
yeah that's what then what he has to find out
maybe you can uh find it in your email right now then we know then we exactly know what it will cost us
if if i
maybe is that that's nice to know
regular chip and because we don't have uh special functions to use uh in advanced chip for example
yeah bu bu but when we yeah but when we skip when we um when we don't use the do we're not gonna make the docking station
i like the hand dynamo part
then we still yeah we need something else maybe to make it kind of special because that was our our special feature
we can make a plain docking station for two euros
yeah
we'll go back uh tomorrow
i mean
yeah okay you can also do that but maybe
wi wi without recharge
it still is a special remote control cons uh you know wi its form is special and material
yeah but but we can make a docking station for two euros uh if you don't put the recharge function in it
i mean
it has a shape
yeah but for two euros then we have still maybe we have to use the advanced chip then two euros isn't even possible
of course it has a shape but i i
why should that not be possible
yeah then because then we'd thirty cents left
no for for the uh for the docking station if you do if you choose the simple chip
yeah but yeah i don't know because maybe d uh yeah we have to find out with the simple chip
that's the question
if we do i do we need an advanced chip or is it okay f
yes
yeah and w and and we uh need f and what is this
it isn't in my information so i don't know it uh either
sample sensor sample speaker
it isn't in my information i uh i i've got a
schematic view of the remote control but nothing about uh advanced chips or
you can look at it for s presentation
s technical functions
no
uh i've got here in uh i will put a i will put a page on it
no no they were uh mine yeah
oh
when my mouse works again
oh oh oh
hey
oh
my mouse is uh
dead
yes
reanimate it
oh
died
ah i've got it
i will put uh
my email on the
the network
what the hell are these
it's on it
oh whatever
yeah it's open
mm
i don't think here it's in here already
it's circuit board
it's only just basics for for
it's nothing about s yeah
yes
at the end circuit there is an infrared led
this isn't helpful
no
but i in the presentation of yours there was also something about different components
which one was it
components design
functional requirements
um
no that was my presentation
components design maybe
yes that was mine
n on top
ah
ah yes it was the second one
but that was my second
yeah it was your second your first presentation
it's already open
it's at the bottom
working design
sorry
it's uh at your task bar
yeah but it's the the other one
oh
mm
uh this is n this is not this n that's not the right one
was it working design or components design
sorry
i don't oh
okay sorry
no this is the other one
or maybe something is uh maybe there's something abo in in these
chip set
but this is the same uh
this is o only the possibilities
here
yeah
we can use a simple a regular or advanced chip
yeah nice
the display requires an advanced chip
i it doesn't say anything
you know that a push button requires a simple chip but a scroll wheel it it me requires okay so we only need a simple chip
ah okay
requires
with the light
little lights
yeah but that that's just the same as the the led
no no that's just a simple chip
that's not needed
a scroll wheel it s uh only states that a scroll wheel requires a regular chip and that a display requires an advanced chip
so we don't need any of them
a display uh is of course uh for showing letters
l. c. d.
for showing text
yeah
i don't think that uh just a l a little light
no
i think uh the uh normal uh simple chip will be okay
yeah i agree
and what's the sample sensor slash sample speaker
maybe you can say against the remote uh page uh f uh page up page down
yeah
yeah i guess so too
yeah true
next channel
well that's not too what we want
no
well we might want it but
okay
all in twelve euros
back to the costs
yeah
twelve euros and fifty cents
so we're gonna use the simple chip
so simple chip is okay
great
delete
yeah
and the lights
where uh are the lights
yeah lights yeah there's no
well there're three i guess
category
nah there is some money left to be spent
can we do it wi within two two euro
i think we can make a docking station
okay but what we have to think about now is that is is it still a special remote control
yeah
but i mean it isn't it hasn't got any innovative technology we aren't gonna apply any uh innovated innovative te technology anyway i think
mm-hmm
i don't i don't see any possibility to do so because it would wouldn't fit our defi design philosophy
but it's original
but what w is there some extra maybe i think maybe the kinetic thing is something
no that's true
instead of the rechargeable the rechargeable thing was something to um know so y so people wouldn't have to worry about their batteries anymore
m bu
maybe we if we put the kinetic thing in it
but but sometimes you put a
yeah you leave the p yeah i know but still i they will think about that
i mean if you u
kinetics aren't uh nowadays only used in watches and that's because you're always walking
the uh it's made for s people well the they don't if it was uh uh r useless technology they wouldn't put it uh as a possibility
uh solar cells are useless
and i it it th th the the target the target uh group are people who zap regularly and throw with their remote control as a matter of speaking
or the hand dynamo dynamo
yeah
because i think it when when there w was a remote control where it was useful to have a kinetic uh uh power source
then it would be this one
because it's one it gets thrown around thrown around a lot and it gets used a lot
hey that maybe that's cool that's a cool thing about it you know
yeah but but if we ca
you don't use batteries
i've never seen it before in a remote control
i don't know if
but then we could make a docking station
five minutes
no we we we can't make a docking station anyway
that's not true
yeah we can als or uh also m we we can make one we can still make
we can make a docking station for two thirty
wow w why no li look at now we got two
two thirty
fo for a docking station
two thirty left
we can make a docking station
ca can't we make a docking station of that
sure
with a cable with uh buttons on it with retrieval uh device in it
sure
i don't know
the power device is is i i is very cheap
that's just a regular uh power cable and whatever
yeah but be serious then uh the docking station will be a fifth of the price of the remote control
wi with a button to
well we we uh
so
wi with a button to retrieve it so it will beep
uh so it's uh wireless technology
yeah
yeah but we uh we don't inc we haven't looked at the these costs of the speaker and other stuff
i don't think it's realistic for you to do so
well then it's a useless project
look at the case the case the case of of uh of uh
oh because we
yeah then we don't have any innovation things
we well look at all the special stuff we have
colour a the colours are special the form is special
it th this is whole concept
can't we uh
uh maybe it with the kinetic thing i think we could do uh do a compromise uh with the kim kinetic thing
can't we say fifteen euros
uh no
no sta yeah i mean
no then we have to sell it for thirty euros
no
no we only make less profit of it
it's the
you can sell for twenty seven and a half
then you make as much profit as you would with twelve and a half production costs
no
yeah i don my suggestion is to just forget about the whole docking station thing and make it uh like a
uh uh i i i i still fee i also feel this concept of making it kinetic
because of the you know it g it gives something dynamic to the remote control
i don't think
maybe we can uh can do it both
maybe we can do it both uh in the in the in the remote
battery and kinetic
no
no that wouldn't n no
thirteen twenty
yeah and it is also not a good it's not you have to really do it only kinetic you don't want it to think about batteries anymore
and i think only
yes but when it's then when it then you have to shake it uh and all when it's when it's empty
yeah but only kinetic then you gotta
no no
yeah it's great
you you gotta throw uh throw it through the room like twenty times an hour really
no no no
no no this is very sophisticated technology technology
when you use it your remote like once a day or maybe even less i i it
you asked for three d
no that's n that's not true
uh a watch is uh kinetic because you walk all the time
no
it we can make it yeah no
becau be but a remote control gets why do they state that this technology can be used if it
yes solar cells are also stated
yeah m but a w uh uh n uh a calculator also works on r on solar cells
why don't we use solar cells then
because i think the d whole dynamic part do you know appeals to me qui uh thinking of our design philosophy you know
with the rubber parts and uh sturdiness of the thing and y when you move it around a lot
then people find the idea funny that when i move my remote control around and
that's true
yeah it's funny for a week
i guess something like that where you have to move it around very frequently is demotivating
yeah but you don't have to
trust me
the idea of this technology is that you don't think about it it just happens
no i i don't move my uh my remote control very much seriously
okay then we d okay well y we don't have to do it but what that would just have a lack of key features you know
oui
you m have to put something on your box
you have to make people buy it and uh
we can really can do the docking thing uh it's not yeah uh we can do it but it's would be a easy way out
you can do it for fifty cents
well we've got more than fifty cents
the c the case the case alone is is is uh
okay but we have to grou to agree upon something because uh we only have a minute left or so
the case alone for uh remote control is at least one euro
then we have one euro thirty for the whole docking station
no no it's not possible
okay w b we can s we can leave it on be well then then th it's this is then then our concept is ready
cheap remote control
yeah we make some extra profit of it
yeah
no we won't but that's um something else
but now
it w it won't tell but
no this not gonna sell
huh any ideas
no
of course not
no uh n no
great
it's great
yeah we just have to go all what we did today again
our remote control
you have to do it over
we come back tomorrow okay
yeah
no no uh there's still there's still someth concept and something special left
yes
the
seventy euros
i mean we're gonna it's gonna excel in in on in the the range in the field of design and and uh looks and feel
no but no
that's what it's makes it special
yeah and i would li i would have liked a kinetic part as well to give it some
just to give it some extra special feature and uh i know it will work
but uh it's it's an they're they're not putting technologies on this but if it if it was impossible to
to make it happen
why not a hand dynamo then
okay well we leave it like this
then it's c then we're yeah
yeah yeah
we can't do anything else
warning finish meeting now
we're done
okay project e uh well we were gonna what look take a look at the last sheet
is this it
yeah sure
okay
no we can't
yeah we have to yeah it's
no
yes yes
yes
celebration
i don't see why but
where's the champagne
i think we gotta fill out another questionnaire to be honest
yeah
i don't uh hear a bell
no not yet
alright i'll see you guys in a minute
we can do it here then
bye
i don't think so
can we can't we do it here
i don't know
i don't i don't think so
uh-huh
just fill that one in
yeah we're doing now
but it's
oh okay
uh i don't know
nice
i dunno
throwing away my toothpick
hi there
yo
ow
'kay
uh
nice user interface
yeah
what the
uh
yeah well ja well let's just start
'kay
i've uh made a presentation
right let's see it
uh but uh i'll open it on the smartboard so we can all see it
so it's in the project documents because that's what we can find here
well
very nice
well this is called the the the kick off meeting
so uh i'm the project manager so i had to fill it in and uh hmm
'kay
oh sorry
and an uh a nice agenda
uh we'll do the opening and then uh
we'll meet each other what uh we already do so that's not uh very much trouble
i'll i'll show you the
the tools we have here so that we can all use them
then uh we'll look at the project plan from uh real reaction
we'll discuss about our first ideas about the project and then uh we'll close the meeting
and then we can uh individually uh do our things and then uh we'll get back here
so this the opening we'll uh
we have to uh design a new television remote control
you have heard that uh already i think so
mm-hmm
um we want it to be original so a nice uh a nice new design
uh trendy it's also for young people and we have to just uh make it uh modern
and uh friendly so size does matter
and uh
well it has to be a have the the right uh the right buttons on the right place that kin those kind of things
mm-hmm
other uh
there happen to be uh three stages
functional conceptual and d detailed design
um so every time we we'll do some individual work get meeting talk about it uh and then go into the next phase
that's just it
um
we have uh these two smartboards
um well as i just showed there's a project management folder a project document folder on the desktop
it just works exactly the same as a computer
you just uh click on the on the folder and you open the everything you you put in it with your laptop
so you can uh make uh words excel everything
um and the w the r uh the rest uh also works the same so uh when you open a notepad you uh you just get your uh things
you can uh draw
this is a uh well a drawing board
you have a these
different uh functions on the board
you can see them there
so you have a a nice pen and it's works just like a bal ball pen
this is just a
i want to uh
oh yeah
maybe you should try to write on the on the big white uh does it
of course w doesn't work any more
yeah
yes i will eraser so
it works
wonderful
it's fantas fantastic
we can uh uh well you can save a file
so if uh we draw we have to save everything
don't throw anything away
mm-hmm
uh just we can start a new one
and we just go on and don't throw anything away
just uh let them all uh stand here
we can delete but we don't do that
um you can here select a pen you can draw anything you want
it's a bit uh childish you have to write
it's not as fast as you w you know it but it does work sometimes
well it's just like a normal uh
paint
so it's gone
alright yep
well we are designers so we have to have a a more uh a smartboard
so that's fantastic
um well this uh speaks for itself
we going to try it
so um we all uh are going to uh draw a nice animal on this board not my idea
alright your favourite animal
yes our your favourite
so um i'm to going to have to draw a kangaroo but i'm going d i'm not going to
i'm just uh going to uh well draw a nice uh
grizzly bear
beast w i dunno what i'm going to design
oh um doesn't oh
i hope this was part of the assignment and not uh your uh i hope this was part of the assignment and not uh your personal uh enjoyment
yeah 'kay
hmm
i just said it's not my idea but i am the project manager and officially this is my idea
yeah
i i i i understand
so what
we're kinda losing time though
alright
we're losing time but
ah the first the first meeting is just a bit uh loose loosen up a bit uh meeting each other well uh uh nice yeah
so start
alright
yep yes
sh
i hope our industrial designer does this better because uh this is uh
don't uh count on it
no so a a few legs
do we have to guess
yes yes guess
a hippo
well i should make it an hippo now
i think it's a mouse or a rat
yeah
no i don't think so
oh
oh i know it
well what is it huh
it's a hedgehog
i don't know how to call it
yeah difficult english word
a hedgehog
i didn't knew it myself
well i'm amazed uh about your uh drawing skills
our characteristics sum it up
well it's uh very uh painful those kind of thing
so we can uh just uh
yeah
we're going back and now uh our industrial designer can uh draw its uh most favourite animal
i am the industrial designer
alright
thank you
huh
chief i am the industrial designer
oh uh but this uh marketing designer
yeah
i think
it's pr it resembles the animal drawn by
what kind of animal is that then
it's
i think can i say it
yeah sure
uh it
it's a rabbit
well
looks very nice right
yeah
it looks amazing
no no no
what are you going to do
we want to erase it
no no
no no save it and start a new uh save it
yes
these are very impor
and start a new black uh doc a blank document
these are very important documents of course uh these drawings uh
yeah well we have to save everything so now um the next one uh
yes uh right
and then save it and start an blank document
you go man
thanks
yeah
there's also different colours and different uh
well pen widths uh the line the the thickness thickness
so um well you should uh try it but uh
alright
i should have made mine a white rabbit
well y y y you could have but uh
and he deliberately draws a animal we don't know the english word for
it speaks for itself
what the uh just a duck
it looks like an uh
it looks like that beast from sesame street
nice
yeah
big bird
is it a duck
you're standing in front of it i can't see it
it's it's uh
is it a plane
alright thank you
yeah it's a bird but what kind of bird
it doesn't draw uh circles uh that easy uh
do we have to uh
you have to push harder
yeah just a bit a bit childish a bit
mm
but we have uh do we have to name the specific species of the bird
release your anger
uh no i don't
no
it's just a bird
well wonderful
well uh save the document and then uh
and then a a new blank document for
uh will uh choose a new colour and a new pen width so w we can all see it
here you go
why do i have to do the difficult tasks
uh pen yeah that's
no well first yeah
and then you go to format i think and current colour you choose a new colour
uh current colour
and a new pen width uh also format
i like uh oh they don't have pink
mm
oh b oh think this is uh
it's not like in paint
uh
uh
line width
and you can choose a nice one
line width
width
width width
uh fifteen
with each other
and i can draw
hmm
yeah
so
just a wa that's the way we do it's quite easy
uh
hmm
mm-hmm
it's a pussy cat
it's a cat
oh pussy
oh the line width is too thick but oh well
well then you change it
and erase things
uh
what
it's a pig
it smiles nicely
super pig
now i have to change the line width
uh one
so
these are whiskers you know
yeah yeah yeah we know
right
uh well i think it's obvious right now
yes alright
it's a cat
no it looks great
miaow
well if this isn't obvious
well well um
just save it
i'll save it alright uh save
yeah save it and start a new blank document
uh yeah uh blank
yep
so that's uh what we're going to use when we uh need it
well i feel comfortable now
oh great
well it's terrific eh
thanks for this exercise
it's good for group spirit
i feel totally at ease
yeah that's it
it certainly is
we're one big happy family now
yeah something like that
well then uh the serious uh stuff
we're we want to sell it at twenty five euros internationally um so um but we dunno what exactly th i it is in dollars
but uh twenty five euros
our profit aim is worldwide fifty million euros
so
so i didn't uh exactly uh calculate how much we have to sell
we want to keep it our costs at twelve and a half euros so
keep uh that in mind when we uh talk about our uh materials an f and stuff and uh marketing uh research
right
alright
now then we all uh we can uh sit down and discuss uh what do we think about our current remote controls
first about design uh about uh aim in the market
etcetera
right
well uh we c we can sit down uh because uh presentation can wait
we can uh take notes and uh
well who has uh some uh remarks about the current uh remote controls
well i i didn't have to prepare anything about uh it's not
please
no uh i did
it's it's not my task to uh talk about uh experience with current remote controls but uh
well uh just w we're uh four uh if we if we would just have one then
i think it's im it's important to uh look at uh the remote controls of our competitors
yeah
get the good points uh try to merge them into one universal remote control
yeah yeah
on our corporate site i saw uh a new d. v. d. player uh we're gonna produce
yep
maybe it's important to make it compatible with the d. v. d. player
that's alright
that would be a nice idea yes
so you can uh use your television and your d. v. d. player with the same uh remote control
yep yep yep
furthermore it's important to make it uh acceptable for the whole world for different cultures maybe because we want to we want to well fifty million
yes fifty million is our aim to a profit so
mm-hmm
yeah yeah so a lot of people have to be able to use it
no but uh the b the buttons have to uh have to have uh international recognisable buttons and uh
so
easy to learn
yeah
yeah that's right
yeah
yes
and numbers and uh that every culture in uh yeah people in every country can recognise
yeah
i'll make uh notes and then uh maybe uh well i'll put it in the project uh folder when i'm done uh just now
mm-hmm
alright
i also think we should not add too many buttons
well yeah
right
modern day uh remotes have too much buttons i think
no that's right
y y you don't use uh the half of them that's that's culture uh international
precisely
maybe we could make one button to switch between d. v. d. player and t. v. and make the other buttons uh multi functional or something
yeah
yeah indeed
yes
yeah so it doesn't uh become too complicated with too much buttons and uh
yeah right
yep and maybe we do uh we even have uh more than just a d. v. d. player
don't we have uh other uh ou
yeah we should make it compatible perhaps with everything we use we uh we make
and stereo uh s uh audio installations
uh
we also uh just uh released a t. f. t. uh thing i saw
yeah so but th that's kind kind of standard t. television so it also works on that
yeah
yeah
yep
and i think the people who who will buy our uh remote already have some experience with remotes
so we can keep that in mind
most people do yeah
well yeah
it doesn't it doesn't have to be
it doesn't have to be but we can
w well it's a n it's a new remote and you don't buy a remote if you don't have anything to uh to control with it
well except if we deliver it together with our d. v. d.
yeah but
yeah
yeah alright but
we need to to keep it consistent with other d uh
yeah because we look at competitors and w if we pick up the good things about that and give it a nice design
well
hmm
yeah but it's it has to be useable
it has to be different and familiar at the same time
yes
yeah
yeah
yeah we could use another form or shape or colour that kind of things
yep
yeah the shape will will have to be recognised
i thought about uh like most uh remote controls uh are uh a long box shaped thing you can make it uh triangle shaped
yeah
no
but that's not uh very recognisable
well we we could make more more oval or something and and
oo
oval
n we can use uh it as a as a game pad
i
yeah or so
so one hand has the beer so the other hand uh
mm
well yeah it's new
not with two hands
yeah yeah yeah right
no
but young people want something different and it is
well i we already uh one of our aims is that it has to be original and trendy so
yeah but it's quite important that it fits
yeah
yeah
oh but it ha it has to be m yeah
but you still have to know it's a remote and not another
yeah alright
well there has been done a lot of researches about remotes uh we have to we can imagine uh because it's a long time uh on the market
so the the form will have been uh tested out so
yeah
yeah so the long box uh shaped thing must be uh yeah useful
yes
or else uh they would have been ano another shape
well for me personally i have a a lot of remotes uh at home but those ones that have a a round ending and uh well uh just an uh square uh middle i don't like to use them
i have uh have to it has to fit my hands
yeah
yeah
when it falls over it and i just have and then the button that i use most has to be here
it shouldn't be boxy
yeah
yeah a lo the long box shape yeah
you have to use one hand
it f it fits your hands and then you just push the button that you use most with thumb
nah
i don't agree with the long box uh shape it it has to be custom made for the hand
why not
yeah it doesn't fit
tho tho those new d. v. d. players on the market do have those
yeah
but it does fit in the hand if you hold it like this and you can make it another shape but then you have
yeah but if you shape it
no if y if you look at new phillips uh d. v. d. with their uh remotes pl players they they are the new remotes aren't box shaped
if
d. v. d. players
yes
w no w what else
they're all um
no that's ol old fashioned
i di
well
yeah
yeah well but uh what what what do you suggest then
i can imagine that us
yes uh
well most of of them are are somewhat thicker at the end and get um yeah thinner towards the uh the other end
well
yeah right
it fits in your palms
hmm
mm
well but it's still then uh the the long box
uh but then with some uh round uh round forms in it to fit your hand but it's it's still
yeah it
hmm
well
a it h it has it it has a that's tha th th shape that it fits your hand
um
yeah yeah al alright but but it's still it's still sort of box yeah
that's
it it has round forms but it in the end it's still the box so that's what i mean
well
yeah yea
yeah but it has it has to fit your hand
yeah yeah i understand but no no i don't mean an entire box like completely square but a also with round edges of course
it shouldn't be too boxy you know
it's
hmm
no no no
but in in in at the end it's still this long
yeah
yeah it should be
box shape with convenient uh round uh shapes uh
right maybe something like this or and then a button here to switch between different systems like d. v. d. player and so you can i've
to fit
yeah yes i thought about something like that
yeah
a big recognisable button on top or something
yeah right and i do think we have to keep this kind of idea
yeah
with the with the numbers and
we have five minutes left
so
the buttons should uh also be not too small not too big of course and uh n uh uh not too close uh together
right
yes uh that's yep
but it should be possible to to um make it
ap apparent that there are two functions for every button
yep
so there has to be some space between the buttons
uh-huh
yeah of course uh to uh to uh to have icons to explain the different functions
yeah
yeah right right and maybe we should use colours
yeah
colours yeah
yeah maybe we can um just like on cell phones those um well you can you can put on on them
yeah
ha
and so you can customise your uh your own remote with different colours or or special paint jobs i dunno but
that's kinda trendy
yeah right
sound nice
yes
i think we have to talk also about uh the the materials for um
well
well it's just uh about our first ideas now so i think individually we'll have to uh come up with ideas for the next meeting about these materials and markets etcetera
right
but
i think it's uh it's important to uh notate all the the decisions that we make so we
already thought about something tha
yes
yes
well thirty minutes we have
mm-hmm
so um
this is about uh what we are going to uh do uh
you'll get specific instructions when you're back in your room so uh it's uh logical uh
yeah
i think
no problem
oh and uh that's uh that's all
so we'll just get a notice that the the meeting is uh over
yeah now we can still talk about the material we have some some minutes left uh i w wrote down uh that the case should be plastic of course
yeah yes say
mm
hard plastic the buttons should be uh rubbery i think uh
yeah
yeah it shouldn't be too heavy
no n n
well i have had remotes that um they had uh the function of the buttons was about uh uh a layer over the buttons and when i've had use it much it was gone
yeah that's bad yeah
yeah yeah yeah
so it has to be made in the buttons i think
it has to uh not be loose
yeah that's important
mm
alright
and of course there are several electrical cables in it to uh to connect things uh to each other
yeah
is there an a universal uh universal way of um transmitting from the remote to the television so it's all about uh
yeah it's univ yeah yeah yeah
i think so
it's a a common stan standard way infrared beams an infrared beam i think
it's not that in china it's different
yep
yeah
but y you can have uh of course different between d. v. d. s and televisions and between
and you can use
it it's a we we make an a universal remote so it ha has to work with uh all kinds of brands and things
yeah
yeah
yeah
but our t. v. s are mostly made in china and that sort of country so
probably yes
china rules
and have well yeah i've wrote something down about how it works
the user presses a button and with an infrared beam it signals the television set accordingly but that's pretty obvious i think
but are
are we going w uh with the front uh fronts uh idea
well i think uh w we can look into that in the in the next uh thirty minutes
i think we should make it universal and you can always use a front front on it you know
yeah
you can use it just plain but you can
yes
well j just y you get a n a normal front with it but you can change them uh when you buy the
to make it more trendy
yeah
right
yes
right
yes
and we should uh dispatch those kind of fronts fronts a a around the world so uh
mm
yeah
well you can make profit with them and it's a way to make them trendy
well th those fifty million don't uh don't se sells itself so we have to uh make uh some extra effort like fronts uh
well but th but the standard front will be uh just grey or something uh b a simple colour not not very flashy
yeah right
yeah alright
yeah normal
yes
yeah well it has to it h it has to fit the the te television and d. v. d. set we are going to sell
no a colour everyone accepts
so if they are uh black and black black and silver we'll make them black and silver so
mm
pink television sets pink remote
mm
yeah yeah yeah
yeah
standard
but people of often don't like bright colours or something
we have to make it grey or s or black
well young people s li
yeah but then you can use a a front
yeah yeah yeah
alright
yeah
i must not forget my pen the next time
well if if you yeah
if you have a a a television room for little children and you make a if if you buy a a pink front they'll they'll love it
yeah
yeah that's right
i think
yeah or a t teletubby front
but that's uh marketing uh research you can uh you can ask uh
yeah yeah yeah
i will investigate
yes
well our user interface you can uh maybe uh i don't know what your specific instructions will be
but uh probably about uh the precision of the buttons and and those kind of things and what buttons will have to be on the
uh remote
and you will look into the technical design and um form i think
mm yeah also the the look and feel uh of the the remote's also my task yeah
or something like that
yeah
yeah
right
what's the uh url or the website 'cause i didn't
yeah i uh w was wondering that too
y you went to the company website
euro
get
it's
well it it it's if you uh
yeah yeah yeah just if you start up your internet explorer
yeah
it's the the the start uh starting page uh
oh oh right oh well i didn't uh use it
yeah
finish meeting now
oh alright
well uh we're going to back uh back into our rooms so
yes
well that's great
next meeting is in
in thirty minutes but uh i think it will be you will be warned uh through your laptop uh to get over here
thirty minutes
thirty minutes
yeah alright it's it's handy to know
i'll have to restore my uh my desktop uh because uh it's it's the half of the normal size
very handy to know
it's totally broken
right see you in half an hour then
oh right oh
oh
goodbye
w
ma
oh
s
w that was a nice meeting
right uh see you in thirty minutes then
yeah see you
great man
who starts
well i'll uh start just with another presentation so then we can uh look at th at the agenda uh for this meeting
alright great
alright
okay
i've put some uh new things in the in the map
mm-hmm
uh oh
this is it
i don't know the shortcut so ah f. five
well our functional design meeting that's the stage we're in
mm
and you also ha all three of you have uh prepared something about it
yes
well um in we'll uh just have a look at the at the notes from the previous meeting what we uh thought we had dec decided
but uh
uh then we'll uh look at uh the three uh presentations uh from you
'kay
i think you have prepared uh all three uh
well yeah
yeah
um we'll look at th the new project requirements we uh i dunno
y you also have uh received that mail the new project requirements from our bosses
no
no
oh i've received a mail with uh some additional requirements
you're the only one
oh
alright
and i'll have a look if well i think we should show them before your presentations because it's not really uh
smart uh to uh to include some things uh we can't because of the new requirements
'kay
well um then we can make some decisions about our remote control functions
we have to deb we have to decide it in this meeting what our function will be
and then uh we can discuss uh some more closely
we have forty minutes for this uh discussion
uh
uh yeah i think so
alright
well uh the closing uh we'll not uh look at it yet
alright
um now i'll look at show this board
um
well uh notes first meeting
now
i gave a disc a a presentation
uh we familiarised ourself with the boards and then we discussed some first ideas
so
we said that uh
we have to merge the strong points from our uh competitors and uh look at their uh remote controls
right
we should make it uh compatible with our new d. v. d. and other releases we have our technical releases
huh
uh not too many one buttons
one recognisable button in the middle where you do the most important functions with
and um well they can have two functions because uh you have a d. v. d. and a television
yeah
um the design has to fit the hand be original but also be familiar
it's uh one of our ideas
yeah well that wa it's just thirty minutes ago so it's not quite uh but well i have to do it
yeah
mm-hmm now it's right
the materials uh well should be hard plastic with rubber from and uh well the labelling of the buttons should be indestructible
it should be uh recognisable at all times
it's meant to be easily wiped out yeah
mm
yes
okay
well fronts were to be just like mobile telephones
and uh the technical aspects um and also labelling of the buttons the functions should be universal standards
well that's just uh some ideas from the first meeting
mm-hmm
it's quite logical al all of it
um now the new project requirements i'll just show them
i got this mail
from uh our bosses
well teletext goes out
oh
we will not use teletext
okay
maybe a new sort of thing but n but not teletext
i i disagree but uh it's not uh t it's not my place to disagree i guess
well
the second is a bit
sh pity because we just said we wanted to d include the d. v. d. and they don't want it because of our time we have for this project
oh
alright
oh alright
oh that's a shame
so that's a shame because uh especially for the third requirement we want to reach people under the thirty years
because uh we don't have those customers a lot at th at this point
um well it's a bit pity because it's just those people want to have uh one remote control for all those technical devices they can uh reach it
yeah
but let's forget about it
it's just time consuming so we uh have to go on
yeah
well and uh our corporate image should stay rec recognisable in our products
so uh we have to uh use uh maybe a slogan maybe a colour
and um yeah well uh on our remote controls the design has to be uh well as we already said a actually uh familiar
yes
uh not only just uh the shape but also our company
yeah we are a real fashionable company
i read uh i read it on the i didn't know what company we were but we we design uh especially trendy uh trendy trendy stuff
yeah
yeah
yeah
mm
yeah
so it has to be uh a modern design
okay
that's important to know uh when you design a thing of course
yes
i i uh noted uh our uh slogan that we have our company
it's uh we mm put the fashion in electronics
yeah
right
so maybe that's a slogan we can put uh somewhere on our remote control or something
yeah
alright then um we're going to uh have three presentations
yeah
you want to start
yeah
i think i have to start
oh you have to start
i didn't see anything about uh who had to start
oh no no problem
the order
no
well s then start
mm
i i just have to uh to think which file's mine 'cause i was uh bit in a hurry
okay
well uh
i think it's this one
but i'm not sure
you already uh opened uh powerpoint
hmm
yeah
s
right
yes
this is it
yeah
well i'm going to tell you something about functional requirements
mm-hmm
um to start with these points
uh next sheet
um at first i tell you something about what people dislike about the current uh controls because it's uh a smart thing to exclude those things
uh furthermore it's very important what they do like and what they do use
um then i tell something about um the most important issues
so we have to focus on those three thing three things
and in the end i'll um show you our target audience or our target product users customers
well um the first findings are that people um
think most controls are very kind of ug ugly
that's seventy five per cent of the current users
they don't like it so we might think about fronts in that section
um
they also say that's about uh i thought it was fifty per cent uh that more money will be spent on uh better looking controls
so it's very important that you design a a nice looking control
um the current user uses his machine just about
well all of the time for a few functions
uh almost every user uses it d the the control for just ten per cent of its capacity
so it's really important to make the the buttons for the common uh tasks kind of big or kind of uh flashy
furthermore it's uh seventy five per cent of the users uh zaps a lot
thus it might be uh might be smart to make a a big uh zapping button or something in the middle so you can reach it with your thumb
you can zap away
yeah yeah right
yeah
yeah
right
a lot of losers um users lose their controls in their in their living room
so it might be sensible to make some kind of a button on your television
that's your um your control beeps or something that you can find this very easily
yeah
well
i dunno maybe that's an idea
'cause it's uh a big i think fifty per cent of the users loses his its control within the same room
oh
oh
yeah
it should actually uh it should actually be loose from the television because it can also be used for other televisions
so
so if you deliver a small uh click on device that you can put on your television that bleeps to your remote control everyone can use it
yeah but what if you lose your click on device
no you can click it on your television
yeah but if someone d somebody else uses it in ano other room or something
yeah in another room yeah
nee but it it specifically says it's uh the the control is lost in the same room
well yes
mm-hmm
yeah
so
well a beeping device would be uh furthermore the learning time is a problem
well we'll have a look at it yeah
uh thirty four thirty four per cent um thinks it's it's too uh too difficult to learn
so the the learning curve should be very short uh for the dumbest people should be able to use it
i think our uh user uh expert should also consider manual a manual for the remote of course
yeah but people don't read manuals
uh
i didn't read it
oh alright
no
no
users to uh add one
do you think
i don't think
i think you should put more time in the in the design of uh pick up and use than a manual
yeah
mm-hmm
yes you should you should could take a look at it and and and know how it how it's supposed to work
yeah alright
yep
because they don't use it
alright
yeah
right
well there sh should always be a menu but it c can be very short
and it should be consistent with consistent with older remotes
yeah but nobody reads a manual about a remote control i think
yes okay
well maybe for the if you don't recognise a button who d who d who do i call uh wh when i don't know it
alright
yeah right
it sh it should be there the manual
but but not to explain how the remote works
only
and we don't have much time
so it's better to uh put our attention to the the design
so you can pick up and use it than i think
well we are a design team we can say to some uh writer uh make a manual point
hmm
yeah right right
isn't it part of the of the u no
so
no
well we'll have a look
never mind
next point
um yes
um r. s. i.
well that's about twenty per cent i thought
but uh the designer should uh take it uh should uh wie zeg ik dat
consider the m
yeah consider the consequences of using your remote
it should be a good in your hand
yeah
mm-hmm
yep
right this is the most important part
um we're like the requirements said we're gonna specify of we're gonna target a younger audience
um that's about sixty per cent of the market so it's uh quite important
um research shows that they like to have a little l. c. d. screen on their on their uh zapping uh device
uh
i thought it was the age between sixteen and twenty ninety nine per cent of uh the people like that
well
so it's very important we should definitely have that in our uh designs
well with twelve euro fifty as production cost we can't uh afford an l. c. d. uh
it's going to be expensive
no
yeah
yeah but they think it's really important
so if we want to s if we have a big
yeah
if we make lots of uh of the stuff maybe we can uh buy it very cheap i dunno
we have to uh
well we'll uh consider it uh
well yeah well uh it's your your task to uh look into the costs uh of those uh nigh i know
we'll think abo we'll think
yeah i don't know
i don't have any information on that
so
no we'll look we'll look into that later
right
alright
and uh another thing is uh speech uh recognition
they also like that but research is very uh costly
i think that's uh difficult to realise also
so
yeah but
it it might be important for the sale
we have very demanding clients
it's not yet a standard uh development uh those so
no and we have customers in multiple uh countries i think
well i do think l. c. d. is more reachable than the speech recognition
we sh
yeah absolutely
yeah
so we might consider l. c. d. screens
no
yeah yeah alright
well we'll consider both and and see what uh what what we can find i think
alright
yep
we don't rule them out uh yet
'kay
alright
um i think that's it
um
alright
i think
it is sensible
to u uh to take this take these points into the notes
so you can right
yes
well you i c i can uh still see your presentation
yeah
right
it's in the well uh next um i dunno who is next
you uh got uh
shall i give a technical talk
oh you go
yes
alright
well go ahead
well uh it is my task to uh explain uh or to point out a working design
yip
we have that here
okay how do you enlarge it so that you can have the f. f. five
f. five
f. five
yep
alright
well the working design that's my uh
next button
well alright uh you know who i am and what i do
so uh we have this
it's a bit uh unclear because i wanted to copy paste something
it was originally in black and white but it became black and purple
oh right
purple
but i think you can read it
yeah yeah yeah
um well um i think it's important uh for you to realise the basic function of a remote control
a bit
uh well you can see uh
maybe you can select it
so it uh inverts
and i then can select i can select on the dings it goes to the next page
the p the whole picture
nah uh never mind
click
well you can read it it's not too difficult
yeah go ahead
meanwhile this is a schematic uh um view of uh how a basic remote control works
you have uh basically uh the energy the power of the of the remote control uh and the sender
w which is the led the the the the the the the the the bulb that sends the the infrared beam to the no to the set
yeah
alright
and uh the source is of course the user
uh the user interface is um uh the the the buttons of course
and the the user interface sends uh the the different signals of the different buttons to the chip
and the chip uh sends it to the led and the led sends it to the receiver
that's the that's the basic idea
yep
very basic
um well i have uh uh put it in a in in in a a couple of basic steps
uh the remote uh is basically just waiting for a user to press a key
it does nothing until uh of course uh the key is pressed
the key a signal to a chip uh the chip senses the connection
uh and recognise the key
so well you understand
the chip uh produces morse code um a specific code to indicate that specific button that is pressed of course
and it uses transistors in the in the remote control to amplify and to send uh that signal again to the to the led
which is the bulb of course
now the led produces an infrared beam and signals the well it's uh very simple and signals the uh signals to the sensor on the t. v. set
yeah
and the t. v. set uh also recognises the the the signal and performs the assigned task
so it is also why we have to have a button that says uh i'm now busy with a d. v. d. uh if we had done that
and a button for t. v.
ah bu yeah but we don't
uh we no no but yeah
so
exactly
uh well this is uh the basic uh function of a remote
i've some couple of pictures here
it's a very basic one
and uh if we if we're going to add an uh an uh l. c. d. screen to it it uh won't look anything like this but
this is very basic uh basically the the shape of um of a remote control
it has uh very little buttons and but it it uh it's it's quite um yeah you can easily recognise the buttons
they're uh far enough apart and an anything
it's not very um
high tech
uh not very high tech uh indeed and it's not very user friendly
uh if you look at the shape it's uh just a simple long box uh shape
so we have to uh change a little bit uh to that uh so that uh it becomes more user friendly
and that uh problems like uh r. s. i. and uh those kinds of thing don't don't oc don't occur
right
can i say something
yeah
um i have a table here about uh the l the relevance of the buttons
uh the power button is used very much channel selection volume and teletext
well teletext is not an option so that uh but i think it's very important to make um the power
mm-hmm
channel and volume buttons uh near to the thumb so you can't have r. s. i. uh consequences
yeah because they are the the most important buttons and you can immediately
right
make them big make them easy to uh to press
well but but if you have um the most used buttons all in one place and you keep making the same um well moves
you don't have to look and and search for them
you can also like
right
yeah right
yeah i was thinking you can
but if y if you would put it at a different place then you have to move your hands and that's on of the things about r. s. i.
right
yeah that's right
are some of the the the um
that's right
that's right
well you you can't have any uh every button under the thumb of course
we
no but the most important buttons m maybe you can just put them a bit apart so you would
but
yeah
that's very important
and
reject r. r. s. i. r. s. i.
maybe you can make for for channel changing two little buttons on the side of the remote so you can just do like this
like some uh little uh gameboy things or some hmm
yes i've saw that on m on mi mobile telephones they also have uh those buttons
but is that is that useable
do people uh when they pick up a remote know that they have to do that
it's a f it's a new feature you can make make a double feature l like a button on the top and under it
well
well it it's
yeah
yeah alright but
yeah but if you s say them up and down they they'll understand it i think
well also i if someone puts picks up his uh remote
yeah
eighty per cent would
well
if someone puts up i uh picks up his remote and he picks up it he he touches the side then he's a already on the next channel
yeah he feels it immediately
yeah that's true
that's very irritating i think
yeah that's right
yeah
yeah but
well
right continue
sorry
but in e in any case the the basic function should be uh indeed and as you say at the thumb
no
i think that's a good idea and uh and that the less important uh buttons like the the the different channels
uh the numbers one two three four five as well should be uh yeah well not in reach because uh they don't use it uh all the time
well it's uh pretty pretty basically uh as you said
yep
and i have some pictures of the inside workings but uh i don't want to get too technical because uh that's not uh very uh useful for you
mm-hmm
yeah that's right
that's your part of the job
so yeah exactly this is uh how it uh looks from the inside
yep
and uh well that's about it i think
oh yeah i still have this
oh i had to delete this but i had to make a schematic uh of the of the new but i had too too little time
alright
okay
but uh don't uh
well we understand
don't look at it please
alright
i i think it's it's clear uh how it works
we understand
yeah it's clear
alright
oh right no
that's the most important thing
nice
alright
then uh mike can uh give the third presentation
uh
how late is did we start his presentation uh
right
i dunno
i think uh w
about twenty minutes ago
wha yeah
well then we have still the time so but we do have to come to a decision right later on
losing time losing time
yeah right
so
so
mm
well i thought um everybody on the website uh would see the same thing but
i don't think so
obviously that's not the case
yeah uh there are different uh we have all have different home pages with different links
oh yeah
yeah
yeah
yeah right
uh
for instance you couldn't see this
okay yeah well
um
yeah
well i'm mike user interface designer
mm-hmm
the the method
well
i used my own experience with remotes took a good l look uh at the remotes on the corporate website which are these two
yeah
um
these are already in use
yes these are from from another uh manufacturer
alright okay
um
this one is engineering centred so this one has the most functions and um things
this one is user centred
yeah
mm-hmm
um
well yeah me too
i like user centred
i like user centr centred uh uh also the best
yeah
we also do that
um
well i thought uh that we uh reduce the the option to control the d. v. d. also and teletext and that kind of stuff
mm
uh so i thought we we we would use more or need more buttons than this one
but we have to reject that because of the requirements
but
yes
yeah
th that's why this mm is not relevant any more i feel
alright
um
i think this is about the maximum number of buttons uh we'll need
i um i kinda like the shape
yeah right
i think this is what we talked about
but
yeah
you can't really see uh the differ from different sides
but i think uh
no i've well i showed it somewhere
um
uh you can draw it if you yeah
oh yeah
i think we should go further with the idea of a removable front
so we can can uh yeah customise the
mm-hmm
well absolutely but i th they all have to have something about um the recognition from our company
so we cannot just uh
mm
yeah
make someone w
it's a front
it's not the the whole remote that changes of course
no but that's th the side they look uh look at is the front
but it
you can
so if y if you make a a front with just a a tiger on it then uh our recognition is totally gone
mm
yeah that's right
or you can you can can put the same symbol on on every remote
yeah that's a must
so l like ericsson does every uh
we must have that
yeah we must
we can put it on the on the back side
yeah well and and
s something like this
yes
it's recognisable
'kay
we can make a symbol of the company right here
um
and if you put a front on it there's a hole on the front
yeah
so the symbol's always on yeah
yeah so that you don't replace the symbol yeah
yeah yeah
yeah yeah yeah
something like that in the yeah
or the th the the lowest part of the remote isn't changed by the front
yeah yeah
mm-hmm
but let's not focus on the front
yeah
those kind of things
yes
okay
um well so uh uh like i said i thought we'd we'd use more function
if we we had to include more functions
but we don't
so um
mm-hmm
yeah
alright
i think this is about the maximum number of buttons we need
maybe some less
like eject we don't need and some other buttons we don't need
i think uh
mike uh can you put uh that picture from me on the in the word documents file
yeah i will
in map
i think uh for the remote um uh less is more
the less buttons the better the design
um
yeah
yeah i agree
we should go with that concept i think
i know
alright
i've i've got another point
yeah
um there are two target audi audiences and we've uh chose for the younger one
um research has shown that um it's a high interested uh in features
mm
they are high high interested in feature
but they are more critical
fo yeah critical
the younger uh
so the younger audience
mm-hmm
so we must um must design uh a control that really speaks to the people
well what if we um i at i at home have a remote that has um the most familiar uh buttons on the top
mm-hmm
and the bottom side of the front has a little clip
a f a little uh you can click away and then you have f much more functions that most people don't use but s some do do
mm-hmm
i think uh the most functions uh underneath that uh uh no um mm usually
clip aren't used much
well but because you say they their features are important they want m um a lot but not
yeah right
but
yeah but what kind of features
yeah i think m most
like l. c. d. screens and voice recognition
yeah but yeah
but i've
most uh
here look at these numbers
the newest features are like i said are uh l. c. d. and uh speech uh control
our audience these people are very like these uh features
yeah
mm-hmm
you see
so we must build in something or they will to uh go to the concurrent
uh
competitors
yeah
the concurrent
our competitor
yeah
competitors right
so i do think we have to uh have some features
yeah
even though they cost a little more
well maybe w we could uh s on um some uh calculators you have lo those little little l. c. d. th that you can click on or something
right
right
or that you can click uh out uh of the remote
and if if that's gives you a little bit of sta status information
like a ticker tape
yeah
which programme you are l watching or something
yeah that's nice
those kind of things uh because you also have those uh those program recognition for your v. v. c. r. s
and uh well if y if your remote picks that up also you they can display which programme you're currently watching
yeah right
yeah
yeah right
yeah
so it it just signals the the different uh sig uh the different symbols on the screen you have
yeah
uh because if you change to s channel two you have two on the screen and two on your on your um on your l. c. d. screen
for example
it it could be such a little uh th that you can click in and out and you and you have it
yeah we should keep that simple too
but should it uh really be uh clickable uh or or just integrate inside to try to make it d more trendy
it will
yeah
no not clickable
well maybe
no it should be uh integrated
nah no no no
i think
yeah just at at the top
so when you s you sit like this you can can watch
i think it should be at the top
yeah
yeah something like on um some radios in car
yeah
you where it's yeah walking to yeah
yeah right
it's a ticker tape idea
r. d. s. s or something
but that's of course uh a bit more uh expensive than uh the basic uh calculator design with the scrolling text and that kind of thing
wa yeah
well it's just one script
well i think it's you got it just means it's a script that's uh keeps it uh rolling
and it's not uh that's five minutes off uh implementing time i think uh
yeah five minutes of ja ja for programming
yeah
so i don't think that's the issue
no
alright
alright we go with the l. c. d. screen
uh well i think so yes
yeah well we we we still need to know how much that will cost
'kay
um
right i don't know if i can find that but
we're g no but we're we'll have to look into that
or maybe you will get that information uh yeah
next time
um we can use this board again i think
yeah right
uh we can put some um decisions about um the controls we want th the issue
where is my presentation
uh
yeah i understand what you're saying
uh
we should have a general idea of how it's gonna look
well
i mean we're all here now i think
these i've already given you
so we have to decide on the different remote control functions
right
so we want to have a small l. c. d. screen that's special
at the top
shouldn't we start with the most important parts
at the top or at the bottom
yes
the l. c. d. screen alright but we should start with the power button
i think the top is more uh
uh
yeah
when you s how do you zap
yeah but
you just sit in your chair
huh
with the remote
yeah but with with the l. c. d. screen on the top it gets a bit unnatural
that thing is terrible
'cause most remotes have some space left at the bottom
yeah but that's where your hand ball might be
uh
yeah i dunno
yeah no mm
and then uh
we'll draw two and then we'll see uh
maybe we should uh centralise the discussion here
i dunno what uh you were talking about but
no um he thinks yeah right
we are busy with something
he thinks it's better to put the l. c. d. at the bottom and i think it's better at the top
uh-huh
why do you think it's better at the bottom
well
uh well because most uh remotes have um some space left at the bottom and that way you can keep the shape recognisable for everybody
but your
but you just can put uh the the the the the whole interface a bit down so that there's room for the for the interface
i c
yeah
well i d i think that's that's ugly but
the the ticker the l. c. d. is like like small
it's it's wide
it's not not high
uh-huh
but
i th
well i th i think mike mike has a point
and and we can
because um when when uh when i use a remote i l i hate the buttons but buttons at the at the bottom
yeah
power button always yeah
bottom
yeah
so and and i i like to use the ones
yeah y you gotta zap like this or you want to yeah
on the top
so when i u when i have to have an l. c. d. s scr window
yeah right
but
well that's a bit exaggerated
we're making a remote with with a few functions you know
well i agree with you
it's it's also more recognisable
we
it looks more like a calculator to people if you have the l the the
yes but we we we we don't want that
the thing on top
yeah you don't want you want uh yeah it it it must be a remote
we don't want them to look like a calculator
we want to look it like our original but familiar
yeah w well but uh you don't have to throw uh um important aspe important aspect like familiarity uh completely away uh because i think it's uh
yeah
high tech
yea
maybe a bic uh better uh white uh we white
i think it's still important to have it at the top because it's uh
width
width
uh format yeah format
line width
th that's not a problem
width
it's more familiar that way
yeah
when i draw here it oh
huh
it's a bit off
yeah it's off
a little a little bit
well
it it needs to be calibrated again
well uh let's uh talk about that later uh
well
maybe you should another pen
maybe that's uh better
you e you only have one pen for that screen
where
alright we have to make a decision now because we don't have much time
it's special pen
yeah
yeah
no
um
i think we have uh a few functions and we can put uh the l. c. d. above it
and still have lots of room at the bottom where you can put your hand
yeah
i i agree
i think it should be at the button bottom
well i'm the i i'm the designer so um
at the bottom
bottom
the l. c. d.
in a few minutes oh yeah oh yeah i totally agree
at the bot
yeah
so
yeah
we are two uh v. s. two
well but uh what what if we we first decide the different functions and then look at the design
he's the boss
yeah
right
great
uh we uh we were busy with that
because we have to decide this
uh yeah we should uh summon the the different uh aspects of the thing
yeah
so we have the power button
and moreover i think that you two should be uh come to consensus about the l. c. d. s
yes
it's uh your it's your job
yeah of course
well we have a power button
uh it's uh
no it's our job
yeah
w wh
guys
while you have to agree i can say it's like this and you must agree
for all of us i think
yeah right
guys
alright let's keep it central
yeah
we have a power button setting buttons l. c. d. window the number buttons
the ten numbers
yeah
channel yeah
uh
volume
volume control
yes
um
mm
uh the mute button
well let's look at your uh design
uh
i h love that one
uh-huh
i think we we should use something like this um to um
the the channel up and channel down button
yes
yeah in circle you know
yeah
yeah yeah yeah
well that's that's also design
and and a volume control also in it
yes
right
um
yeah
well h ho
but th th on this remote th these controls are for something else a d. v. d. player or something
yes
yes
yes as i already said we could drop some of these buttons
they are for some uh video uh
so
you should put that uh power button channel and volume should have the most uh importance
yeah
i think these should be in one big circle in the middle
yeah but what he said about r. s. i.
was t kinda true
when when you uh put them all in the same place
the most used buttons you're doing the same thing all the time and that's just what r. s. i. 's all about
so it might be smarter to put them a little more away from each other
apart
so people have to move their hand
and they get less uh complaints of r. s. i.
yeah it's it's also not good to completely stay in one position constantly with one hand
y yeah
that's what i always do because all my i important buttons are the same place
it's good to move uh from time to time
yeah
yeah but people don't like it when their buttons are all over the place
um
yes
they they need to be centred
no but now y w would we have to choose a
well not
frequency of uh button use
way in middle
yes
um channels are uh most uh is most used within the hour
volume hardly
uh-huh
you can see
so the the channel uh channel buttons should be far far apart i think up and down
mm-hmm
no i don't think
oh
up and down far apart from each other
far apart
you thinking uh about r. s. i.
yeah but
yeah but no
well not too much
y look at uh look at the frequency
nei not too much but
the other the other two uh frustrations are far more important
so
i think you can have the two buttons of up and down close together
but you don't have uh have to have volume control and and zapping button close together
well for example the power button you can if someone is constantly z zapping
well they are used four times an hour so
it's not going to miss that it that the power button is not right beside it
because i have someone but the buttons is way
nei nei nei n i i totally agree
so that one can be put away
but just
yeah
right
yeah
i agree
the power button can uh be uh uh
power bu button should be left at the top
yes
and should and should be red
yeah
oh man five minutes
yeah well five minutes left
right just make some decisions
yep
the most important things we have to uh
um how are we going to do it with those numbers
c c can you make you make we can use uh the drawing board now i think
uh it it doesn't work well but but it it would be pretty pretty uh nice if we could just draw a simple thing
well i have it here
i do think you have to keep you have to keep it central now
yeah well that's going to take too too much time
just uh you decide that you decide that and ready
mm
yes
yeah
mm
yes
alright
well the l. c. d.
um you are industrial you are user interface
so i think it's going to go to mike
yeah
but you will have to make consensus with
well
well consensus um we we can put it in the middle so
well it's a bit hard because we are going to be uh individually
nei
we're no we're deciding now so
that's a bit uh
yes
top or bottom
well uh yeah i i still think it's it's quite important though to uh to have it at the top so yeah
yes it is
you say familiarity isn't important but
well what if we're going to now decide about the functions and the design comes into the next round
okay
plus the d th the design round is still to come huh
yeah d
yeah right
yeah
okay
alright
alright these functions
as we we we we agreed we do have a l. c. d.
the number f well yes that's alright
so that's
yeah okay
w the number function
that's enough
yeah
are we going to uh do it like uh on mike's screen with uh one button that says i'm going to do a t two number digital
no
how do you want it to do then
there's one two three four five six six seven eight nine zero
well just when you push a one one and
it it has to r recognise one as there could still come more
no if you on most t. v. s if you uh press two numbers shortly after each other d it yeah
oh like that
um
yes
they'd recognise it
th that's the most that that's very easy
alright so no button for that
yeah
yeah
no
yeah
okay uh anyone any uh oth other functionalities of our uh remote
i think these are the the most important functions
do you still have the pictures over there
yeah
so
yeah that's about it
you do need the uh multi or did uh no like this one
you do need them
no we'd uh just said we didn't uh
yeah i know
but are we
alright alright uh now okay
well uh
um well because we can't integrate it with any other uh remotes all those buttons on those pictures are uh irrelevant
right
so just for a television is that all we need
yeah it's most useable this way
basic function
yeah
teletext is gone
so all those buttons that ar are to do with teletext oh screen placing
we'll have uh those uh buttons about uh
and uh the two important ones we're l f forgetting
uh there's um screen
you can make it wider and less wide
yeah
and the button that you can go to a. v. for your video
right
i do think we have to put that underneath a clip
oh yeah
those two
but it's just two and we make a clip
uh just two just two under uh under uh
th that's a bit uh waste
we we can make make uh a little row of like four buttons down here
yes
yeah
okay right
i i think uh
or at the top
your l. c. d. screen is going to go
or at yeah alright then
but you you can put uh two or three buttons under uh another section
uh that's that's too complicated
you can just put it somewhere they they aren't used much not as much as those other so you can put it somewhere
yes
yeah
oh they can be small or round like buttons
yeah s bit smaller and s well uh and and i think more at the bottom
yeah
yeah or at the top yeah
what do you think uh those those buttons
above or down
well i think they should in an in an isolated part of the remote
and w where
well we design it later
we have it and we design later where everything goes
yes
yes
yeah
yes
well any other uh
well if you you take those th if you
why go to video
go to video that's always on your remote control
yeah but you can z you can zap t you can you can zap to the video channel from zero to uh
to a. v. uh to a. v. a. v. a. v.
the the video channel uh
that's just zero
yeah
well l n no not at not at my remote
no no not always
ze yeah zero is a different channel than uh the the video channel
yeah
yeah but you can can zap down
yeah but when you zap down zero you get to a. v.
yes
yes i think th
i don't
i go to ninety nine
no then you press ninety nine
ah uh well whatever
i think go to video is
an irrelevant button but
th that's the button uh no
but it's easy to go if you are at uh at channel uh fifty five and you want to uh go immediately to the video channel
you do you have to push a to to get below zero
no you can ch push zero
it's more easy to get to uh where the specific uh video channel button
yeah
yeah i i think that one button is uh i use it uh
yeah but if we're choosing to uh incorporate these buttons you have to have uh channel setting if you wa if you have a new t. v.
you have to set the channels
yeah
right all th these uh different buttons you have to
these buttons i don't have buttons for channel setting uh especially on my remote
ah i do
yeah well uh d different screen settings a yeah sk yeah y you you you you have screen width
it's it's incorporated with p m plus and down uh those
yeah well y you must have
yeah you yeah you have one one button from s set frequency o or something and then with plus and min minus you can uh adjust the uh
right
that's the only one we put uh in there
so we still have one uh four
for a screen uh fu uh channel setting
ch ch
yeah to uh oh yeah of course to configure the programme the yeah
programme right
okay
oh the okay button
uh
oh you always have in the centre an okay button for your menu
yeah
yeah alright
menu button
you should yeah
i think that's important
uh and and the settings to change the brightness the settings to change the brightness and the contrast
channel setting menu
we have to go
okay
channel yeah
so um save
chief
chief
yes see
th the menu menu button is also important
then you can uh
yes i have put it in
where
i don't see it
here
oh menu alright
i think things like uh contrast and brightness should be um in the menu yeah
in the menu
and you can uh then adjust it with the zapping buttons or something
yeah the
because uh the zapping buttons aren't used then if you are in the menu
alright
or the volume or something like that
guys
yeah
or the volume yeah
we're going to uh go to our uh rooms and uh we'll have to decide s things on our own i think
your pen
ah
great
so
yes chief
alright
i thought we'd uh lunch uh right now or not
well see you uh w w we have lunchtime by the way now uh so uh
yeah this is this is your thing
ah
yeah lunch break
okay
i am hungry
lunch
get into my belly
ah
we didn't exactly do everything but so
see you later mate
okay
uh door is closed
well let's begin
because if we have as much time as the last uh meeting we'll have to hurry up
i'm listening
right
um well i'll start with the presentation again the agenda
great
yo
so
uh this one i think
uh yeah
well alright
um well i'll show you the notes
it's not as uh interesting as it should be because we just uh had the meeting but i'll show them
we'll get your presentations again on the conceptual design
um
then we'll have to dec decide about the control the remote control concepts
mm-hmm
i've put a f uh a file in the project management folder which says exactly uh what kind of decisions we should take
so this time we exactly know what to decide about
alright great
and then we'll close again
alright
uh
well these are some examples but we'll talk about them later
we'll first look at your uh presentations
mm-hmm
alright
walter will uh start again this time
yeah great
yo
alright trendwatch
'kay
right
i will speak about uh latest trends trends latest fashion updates and uh things we must not do
'kay
uh the trends
it's very important that uh the control is fancy looking and good uh feeling
uh this because of our last model was very functional but it uh people didn't like that so our new mo model must be very good looking
that's uh something you uh have to take a look at
mm-hmm
alright
and uh the feeling has to be very great
also the menus and things like that they have to they have to feel great
alright
um there's a minus uh two times here because this is the most important point
this is uh two times as less important and uh same for this one
less
um technological technological innovations that's uh regarded very highly too
uh such as an uh l. c. d. screen uh speech uh acknowledgement as we uh talked about earlier
well yeah
so we have to have uh something like that like we uh
l. c. d. and our uh our fronts
right
uh the last point is easy to use
well i think that uh speaks for s for itself
i don't know who's uh who's going to look at that
easy to use
well easy to use uh s is a bit uh contradictionary with the first uh functional is not an issue and then easy to use
yeah
i think that's your ta
yeah i know
well we have to choose one of them
i think we have to go for the first one
yeah
it's the most important one
mm
so we have to uh take that one
okay
so it it it isn't very important that that it works easy
well something fancy looking can be can be easy to use
but it has to look great
yeah
we'll we'll look at uh
we'll see
you yeah
yeah yeah you can make a very complicated uh uh remote anyway so ease of use it's not a very comp complicated device
yeah right
but the most important thing is that it looks great and people say wow that's real great uh great concept
alright
'kay
alright
uh these are the new colours of this year
so it must be very bright very colourful
people like this
so we we have to think uh in this direction
so i set your mind to it
so
well
findings
fashion update
fruit and vegetables are cool
i am told
uh you think
the group we are targeting is uh very pleased with fruit and vegetables
so we we we might cons consider in front of uh in in that sort of uh way
yeah well
bananas
uh furthermore uh material that's your part should be very strong
i was thinking of something like uh well uh iron plate over it
maybe in a colour or something that looks so f really flashy but it it is also strong
mm
yeah
and that's uh also for the younger public
b
well the the handy thing about our fronts is that we can follow these trends e ev every year
th this year it's fruits but next year it's it's something totally different
yeah that's great
yeah
but i think we can all make the the fronts of titanium or something uh really thin
yes
so it looks very heavy but you can still uh use it very easily
mm
yep alright
well the don'ts
older people like dark colours and simple shapes
well we don't want uh older people we want young people
so uh we're gonna turn that around
we're gonna have real uh cool shapes and lots of colours
alright
right
wood is popular
okay
aha
we don't want wood
yeah yeah yeah
yeah among the old people yeah
old people
so that's it for me
alright
nice uh well show us
right i am going to tell you something about the components design
uh again i have uh put up the specification properties
this uh so um uh the different uh components of the of of the device
and the materials
um i have heard several things so i uh i'll have to change that on the way
but uh the case
uh i suggested uh in the previous meeting hard plastic
but uh as you indicated uh it should be strong
yeah we should change that
it should feel strong
so maybe plastic is not uh sufficient
we should move to uh something
well maybe it it it is but it doesn't look strong
so maybe
well yeah
y hard plastic i is of course uh pretty pretty tough but it doesn't have a really really tough look
no no no
but we still have to look at our price of course
so
because uh if we want an l. c. d. uh window etcetera uh
yeah
also yeah
mm-hmm
but we'll return to that
yeah
uh the buttons of course rubber i think everyone agrees
and electrical cables copper is all pretty basic stuff
the chips made of silicon i guess
i think that's the best uh way to do it
and infra infrared l led is uh just a simple bulb
then i've uh had a few findings made a few findings
uh the target audience product style
um it's uh um generally the case that uh senior and wealthy people above uh forty five years old uh like
as you said uh particularly the traditional materials as such as wood and materials such as that
they also like straightforward shapes and luxurious style
but of course that's not our uh things this
so this is things we must not do
yes
and then we have uh young uh and dynamic uh people which is of course our uh group the people we aim at
um under forty five years old
uh they like soft materials uh with primary colours
soft materials is of course uh agai again a bit a contradiction with uh our uh material choice of what you said
that uh it should be hard an and and and and strong looking
mm
yeah
but they like soft materials uh so we might uh we have to consider that
yeah
and
also they like curved round shapes
so not uh too formal like like uh the older people want
and if uh also a finding but not very ap applicable here that sports and gaming devices such as uh
discmans for jogging and that those kind of devices gaming devices should define the characteristics of the device
but uh since we don't have a really a sports or gaming device so we don't really have to consider that
sports uh they're uh that uh are accessible on on your l. c. d. uh window uh-huh
soccer fronts
mm
mm
that's nice
hmm
well i also have um
all the results
we keep coming back to the fronts
yeah
several examples of uh styles so you can get a clear picture of uh what i mean
yeah
uh these are the basic uh older older peoples' stuff
yeah
yeah
it was not very uh interesting uh very classical looking but that's n that's not what we want
mm-hmm
we have these kind of things
hmm
fruity
i don't know what exactly they are
it looks like well you know uh you recognise the shapes it's very primary colours uh bright colours and uh round shapes
nai
uh no
you also uh see uh this device it's not very round and fruity of course
fruity
yeah it uh that's true
it's t terrible
alright
and uh well round shapes primary colours
you can see it all here
and of course uh this famous device
hmm
i think as you know something uh some devices like this
yeah alright
so to give you an idea of uh
well it's got a strong look this
this has a strong look
although it's plastic it's it's grey to to to give it iron look
yeah
yeah it still has a strong look
yeah
and it's round
that's uh
but then you are losing your fruity colours
yeah
well we have to make a
well you can make th th th that middle ring can you you can make another colour
that's true
so uh those kind of things you can you can combine
well we can't really make a round uh a round remote control
i don't think that's very practical but but uh it's important to to uh to think about the colour
no it isn't
okay
because if we make it grey or or silvery looking it it does make it a lot more uh does make it looking a lot more stronger
yeah but the
yes
'cause if you look at this it it doesn't look very very strong becau but this is plastic and and this too but
but it doesn't have to look strong
the the results are the feel of the material is expected to be strongy
the feel
the feel
uh alright
well
so if you ti
and it it doesn't have to be strong also
well
nah yeah the feel
you you maybe you should have uh some some coloured titanium or something
only the feel
so it it looks pretty but it feels strong
right
mm-hmm
oh
i agree
and i then i have some more findings
um uh about the energy energy source of the of the device uh i uh suggest uh the basic battery
i uh got some other um uh uh energy sources of course
but solar energy is not very practical inside a house because you don't have a have a lot of uh sun
and uh kinetic and and and dynamos are are not very practical i think
for uh for a simple remote that's a bit oh that's a bit uh
no titanium
that's a bit uh much
and i also suggest uh as a shape uh a double curved case
uh the disadvantage of that that you can use no titanium
that that's the information i received
if you use the curved case uh a curved case double curved then you
what do you exactly mean with double curved
can't use titanium
now uh this uh to give it a more modern look
and uh now the the shape yeah a curved case
um yeah i think uh sort of triangle shaped bottom or something
uh a more modern look not plain long box style but
i dunno
double curved
i'll draw it but maybe later
yeah
it it mean yeah well okay
yeah
and it makes uh it gives it a more u user friendly shape than if you have uh
um anyway
um f as uh for the buttons simple push buttons
no uh otherwi uh no um difficult scroll things or some uh things like that because it makes more complex and expensive
and uh as we agreed we don't use a speaker or a sensor or um uh speak uh speech uh controlled device
yeah right
because it makes it also more complex and expensive
but we do use an l. c. d. screen so we uh we do have to consider uh of we have to use a more advanced chip
which is more complex and expensive
but
well
it's worth the trouble i think because
the buttons can be made of an uh a soft material
because people like that
this soft material thing from uh yeah
uh rubber is a soft material i guess
yeah
uh soft enough
yeah
right
right
yeah
so that's uh basically what i want to talk about
alright
okay
we will take that
and then uh mike
okay
yeah
well um nah the method um we will um include the buttons as we discussed uh earlier
um an l. c. d. s screen will be implemented
um we must decide where this meeting
um there are new developments in speech recognition um systems um and they are already being uh used on uh coffee machines
and um well they're cheap so we could use them now
oh
um it's not really speech recognition it's more um like you can um talk to the chip
that's interesting
uh record the message and record an answer and then once you uh talk to the remote then um he will a answer with the
the prerecorded message that you left
so if i say hi mike and you have recorded uh hi mike back then you will get that
oh yeah i understand
oh okay
yeah
okay
right
but you can also say that when you say something it does some function
no it doesn't does not do anything
no
oh
but i it's just a yeah it's it's cheap
that's a bit uh
but that that makes it cheap
it's it's just a an extra function and it's cheap
yeah
yes
i understand
but it has no functionality for our remote at all
no but
no but that's the gadget they want or the gimmicks
yeah right
but it it's n nice for young people
young people love them
yes we we should really uh include that one i think
they like gadgets
yeah ple
yeah
right
if it's cheap
hmm
um
yeah
well as i said uh earlier i think the uh l. c. d. screen should be uh positioned at the lower end of the remote
um the buttons for screen width and general settings and uh and that kind of stuff
um we can also do let that kind of functions um be shown in the l. c. d. screen uh instead of uh extra buttons
so you put a menu in the l. c. d.
i think young people and yeah w well every user would like that
um the buttons um should be positioned uh positioned the same way as they are on a well conventional remote i think
for the learnability and uh well to keep it recognisable
a voice recognition can be uh implemented
and uh i drew an example but it did not work quite the well uh the way i wanted it to do
alright
can you draw it now of uh can you draw it now
how how
hmm
ah
well i have the i can draw it again and i know what i did wrong
i didn't tick the note bo box in the
mm
alright
um
how do you uh uh give input to the menu on the l. c. d. screen
um with the uh the up and down and and well buttons and the
alright
so you have a menu button and then you can go up and down
well i will draw what i had drawn on the screen
but then we should also have an uh an okay button
yeah right
yes
um i shall draw this
button yeah
if it uh works
just uh there is already a blank
yes
so yeah
yeah
mm so have i
nah
you have to push hard
i suggest a banana shape
because of the fruity uh fashion
yeah
yeah
no m next year that's out
yellow and
yeah alright yeah
just a hunch
well these little buttons are a bit difficult to uh draw uh
yeah
those are the the cha the channel buttons of course
correct
yeah just uh the numbers
and then below is the l. c. d. screen
these these will be bigger in the the real design
alright yeah
this must be the okay button used to uh interact with the l. c. d. screen
mm-hmm
and with this you can uh yes go to through the menus and that can
yeah
um the video button should be uh an apart button because you want it to uh t yeah to use it fast within one uh click
you've
yes
right
and what's the menu button
and you you need a you need a speaker
um it's
for the
hmm
this button can also be the menu button we use in the menus well we we can add another button here but
but how did how do you get out of the menu then
yeah
maybe i you could j just do an an exit with okay
uh by pe pressing the menu button again
by pressing the menu button again you go uh out
uh
yeah
yeah
yeah
it's usual the the the d kind of the way it works
yes well but bec because when you push menu you get in and then you have to push okay when you get to a choice
yeah
yeah
ah right
yeah
well you you
and
but you can men you can press menu again to get out
well that's also the okay button
that's you you should have uh
no no we we we should uh add uh a extra menu button and this the okay button
no
or you can put in the l. c. d. 's uh window an option get out
exit
exit
ah once you have an extra menu button you don't need that that extra option
well it's just a choice
you have uh redundancy
but we need a we need a a recording recording button for the speech uh part
or don't
yeah if we decide to uh to implement that maybe we should
why would you put it uh then and where is the recording uh the microphone
where would you put it
well they that could be anywhere
that's very small
it could be uh down here
uh-huh
um
well not here
i yeah i suggest here
but that's just a little gap
right and spea speaker at the back or something
microphone yeah
yeah
well the speaker and the microphone i think are the same uh little hole thingy
yeah i understand
alright
yeah
uh but uh we could uh d do but it's perhaps more expensive uh the speaker on the back or something
well i
um there are a all already being implemented in in coffee machines so they won't be uh very expensive
but
huh
alright
alright
yeah
okay
this is my suggested design
well okay alright
um yes
um then let's have a look at the decisions we are going to have to make
and oh i think as you can see so the l. c. d. screen does look better uh at the lower end or at the bottom
i'd i agree
yeah fine
but
fine
move on
well yeah yeah yeah
yeah
oh um i had some uh examples
i can live with it
you can uh
yes
but
i did not like it very much but
well these are
too big
quite obvious very ugly remote
yeah
they do they don't look fruity enough
um
nei they're n they're not trendy
no well th
they're all black
yeah
well not all
hey that one i like
uh this is for children but th
tho yeah those
it doesn't look strong
no
no
but it doesn't uh the
w but with the colours i it's a bit the way we're going to
the remote
yeah right
yeah ok yeah
well this is a terrible
terrible
this is just crazy
but it it must not look too childish of course huh
it's it's all too much buttons
um this looks yeah
too many buttons
that's
this uh these are the l. c. d. screens
i think we should if it's um possible uh one with colours but
nah th it's too expensive
i don't know uh too expensive
well that's too expensive i think
yeah
alright
well nah
but it yeah
alright
yeah
okay
ha even more
huh
n
mm no
but are we going for a strange uh form
'kay
no not very strange
'cause people like that
not not too strange
not too strange
no
you can make the the underside you can make it more round where the l. c. d. is
it still has t
yes
th a a kind of bridge
so it f falls over the hand
i dunno if you know the no nokia telephone with uh the round uh thing at at the bottoms s something like that
well
yeah
yeah
yeah
you know
well i have at home a remote with a bridge
it's just a half round half half circle at and then it falls exactly over the hand and that's very nice
that's it feels comfortable
yeah but people like something uh new you know
exotic yeah
yeah different
we have t yeah yeah
yeah
i will design it we design it later
y yis
so we'll get to that later i guess
alright
great
yeah alright
um where did i put it
the specific shape
um conceptual phase i think this is it
the
i got this from our friends
so uh yeah the conceptual design
our sources
these are a few examples which we have to decide about
all the the materials from the case uh the electric cable that's all your uh your side of the story
um
your bag
yeah
um now from the user interface your uh package
um where no well that's more like the buttons where they have to come
and um
b a bit of yeah well a bit of uh design
yeah this is what we've just done
but uh we should decide now
yes but we have to decide about these now
right
ah right
yeah
materials are the most most impor
and uh the trend watching
so as you said fruity is in well sells good
wow
yeah
uh these things
so we have to uh put it in one uh document
uh yes
um so if we uh go through them
copy paste uh this story into a into a word document and then uh put the answers after the subjects
yeah
not everything
well we have to decide all these things
yeah but all these examples are uh of a coffee machine
yeah well uh
w we can uh override them
why should i uh
yeah
so
well a case
uh that's me
uh i suggest well what do i suggest actually
what what kind of properties should it have
uh s solid yeah
well we just listened
i think we why don't we um use uh titanium or or a hard
yeah
yeah some kind of metal for the uh the the whole remote except the front
do you know the new uh
that
just like um most cell phones are
yeah i understand
no no
yeah
so we have titanium
the front is the most important
yeah but the non removable elements of the of the remote so not the front could be titanium to give that uh strong look
yeah
you know what
and then the front is made of plastic
and you can put that on and off and switch it
yeah
but the feel of plastic isn't strong
no but you have titanium of course
no but you you have this yeah
uh you have the best of both worlds
yeah alright alright
'kay
yeah you have the re remote in your hand like this
so you feel titanium
and of course yeah you have the the the plastic front end
but you also have the titanium
yeah
fronts are are cheaper than when they're from plas
yeah
yeah of course but yeah you have to make a
and i don't know if you can make steel just any way you want it to
decision
yeah but it it's expensive
i guess so
uh titanium i sh i think uh
yeah
bendable
huh
bendable
well well the
well any colour
according to my sources uh it's it's totally possible to make an entire uh uh uh titanium is available
and uh we can uh make uh an entire remote out of it if we want
yeah then you you paint it in the colour you want it
yeah
mm
the plastic is is the colour you want it
paint spray
mm
yeah alright
so yeah
so we're going for a titanium back and a plastic front
alright
i've uh
yeah i think that's a nice trade off
mm
titanium back plastic front
okay
um well i am going to put it in here uh because we can uh look
yeah great
yeah
i um solid feel and trendy look
alright
so material um hard plastic for the front
yeah for the front and then titanium for the back
yeah
for the non removable uh part
but then you have the problem when you have a titanium back you can't switch it
when you want an other colour on the front it doesn't match
well but
you know
well titanium is neutral
the titan titanium isn't isn't v very yeah i it doesn't uh curves
i understand
no uh i nei
titanium is very no no no but you know b titanium is very basic colour
yeah yeah yeah
and it doesn't really matter if we have a purple front on it or a orange front
yeah
hmm
yeah
alright
i dunno if if you disagree but i think it's doesn't matter very much
well
yeah
alright
our customers will use those uh funky uh trendy colours and they don't use uh wood
funky customers
and even if it does uh doesn't match it will uh people like mm colours that don't match
mm
yeah
alright
okay
and well the the electrical cable is just normal uh
cop copper uh material
yeah
excuse me
the electrical cable uh does
it's uh from uh our coffee uh
yeah copper i just a ba basic uh
no we don't use an electrical cable
yeah inside but this is for the coffee uh machine
yeah in
yeah well inside the remote control we use a couple of uh
of course
yeah but that's not what's meant here i think
nei
so external
oh external
yeah
yeah
well a coffee grind doesn't have na ja
never mind the coffee grind
well uh all the all the inside work of our remote is uh standard
work
so
right
the chip is normal silicon
uh the buttons are normal etcetera
okay
alright
so that's just easy
mm-hmm
uh we decide about that just by looking at our competitors and our earlier uh remotes
the conceptual specification of the user interface
um well we have our beautiful drawing
alright
well i got a better one here and i will um
well you can put that in uh into the shared folder and then i'll put it in our end report
the shared folder
i will work this out uh for the uh next meeting
yes you can
mm yeah
you can uh put some uh which button is what
yeah yeah yeah
okay
um the trend watching
included these days
and what do we
we thing that fruit and bright colours are
yeah the the the front w
i think we can launch a couple of packages
you can buy a different kind of of of machine but it's the same thing but with another front
yeah
yes
mm-hmm
so
we can also uh implement um we can also implement fronts from um movies that are very hot
yeah that's the whole idea of the front
and you can you can
yeah
yeah
uh those kind of things
yes
yeah right
but that's for later on
the fronts y you can do anything with them
yeah
yeah but if you if you launch uh five different packages like ipod mini
yeah right for the uh initiative uh launch
yeah
for the for the launch yeah
it's good marketing
mm
launch different lines at once
so e th then a c couple of basic colours
not not very uh sim not
yeah n not too heavy
you can always take another pick
yeah
we should not give them the m the most lovely front
they have to buy it later on
when they buy it for the first time
yeah
oh yeah
yeah
yeah right
yeah
come on
more basic
we still have to make those fifty million yeah
yeah
yeah
very boring yeah
well you can you can give them uh s s three or so so that they can uh experiment with it and that they want more
the most boring fronts possible
the most ugly
yeah right
two
yeah but you you can have some basic colours and then we come with the special patterns on them and and uh and uh
yeah
red red blue and green you give them or something and then you can give them uh other ones
yeah
yeah
yeah
alright
um well the buttons etcetera we get from mike
uh this fruit and bright colours yeah well i think we'll have to in the next uh half an hour
we'll have to uh s s specify the different uh types we want to launch when we uh well introduce our remote
uh we still have to make we have still have to make the es the the real basic design
because yeah we have the sketch but
yeah
but we we must remember that fancy look and feel is the most important thing
yes
else it w won't sell
so
yes
alright yeah
well i'll have to before i get another warning for five minutes i'm going to get
where is my mouse
uh where is my mouse
lost my mouse
oh yeah
um this is it
unbelievable
well um this we have
yeah
uh basic stuff
interface we have
supplements l. c. d.
maybe a a cheap voice recording
well yes
yeah we should do that
the price
alright
individual actions
we all agree on that
yeah
mm
industry designer
user interface mike
you're going to work together
on a prototype drawing on the smartboard
yeah we can do that
together or uh yeah together
yeah togeth
that's what i got uh to hear
how yeah yeah but how do i
but bu we stay we stay here or something
yes well we'll get it to hear that i think
but i think so
you can take the smartboard
th they're saying smartboard and that's it
ah right
this is the smartboard so
and take it to our rooms and uh
um so you can uh you you are going to make a prototype and y well that's includes uh specifying the buttons etcetera
ah specific instructions will be sent to you by your personal coach
yeah
so you'll get it on your em on your laptop
um well you will go and do something else uh on the project yeah project evaluation
have fun
some
some non functional tasks
so um
'kay
what are you going to do
uh i don't know what product evaluation exactly means but uh you'll get uh the specifications
we don't have produ product yet so kind of difficult
yeah
that's why i uh
but uh
you're fired
no but
how long do we still have
well can we talk about something else
uh
yeah
uh no i don't know anything but maybe uh anyone else uh yeah
ajax
yeah
um
nah
will we use uh round buttons or square ones for the for the numbers
um round
round i think
yeah
yeah i i i also uh thought yeah
round
to make it as uh as round as possible
and these uh these s these buttons uh are more uh triangle ish shaped with a square one in the middle
why does
curvy
yeah
so you can see you have to up or down
ah f fuck you
yeah
yeah
but now i see the
and this must be uh volume i think and this programme
heh
mm
we can't get
well most of the time uh up and down is programme and left and right are volume i think
well th th th th th that depends uh
yeah
yeah it depends but
well we uh
if you turn up the volume you always see this thingy go up
we we j we'll just give them an uh we'll design it and then they can give comments on it
yeah that's right
yeah
yeah alright
yeah
ts it doesn't work any more
okay
we can't save them
so we'll just have them uh standing there
yeah i noticed
you can't uh click the corners
no
it's a bit uh bit a pity
it's a real real great thing
well we still have uh more than five minutes
um
so what are we going to do
i as project manager ha don't have a clue
let's start the design
oh we can uh decide how we implement the feeling from our company into the remote
well yeah
mm
um i think um a logo our company logo and the slogan should be or could be yeah why not
also the slogan
on the
if there's enough space you can put uh we'll we'll
uh i i'd say only the logo
o
yeah
me too
too much text and it gets too too busy
well our slogan is not very long
it's just a simple what is it
well it's quite a long phrase
we put the fashion in electronics
we put the fashion in electronics
but we kree we keep adjusting to the fashion
you c
with our fronts
so
but you can put it on the back on the titanium part
the logo and the and the
yeah right
ah the logo should be on the top i think
the logo
on the top
yeah
well in in in the right top corner
yeah they do
well yeah
yeah
right corner yes
and well you c on the back you can put uh h at the bottom you can put the logo with the
right corner or maybe here in the middle
uh the text
yeah
yeah
but the logo the logo shouldn't be exchangeable when you get off the front
just just small
uh yeah at the back
yeah it it should be hard on the on the on the board and you can remove the front
well you c well uh yes
yeah well
yeah
you can the logo can be on on every uh front
yeah
yeah but you can scratch it off or something
it's better if you have it uh
yeah but then you must uh really uh yeah push it in or something
carved into the material
no you you can carve it into the titanium at the back
i l i like the idea of the of the slogan on the on the on the thing
but am i the only one or uh
yeah on the backside
well management would like it
well n n not not on the front side i think
the front side no no l no slogan
no not on the front but on the backside
on the back yes you you can yeah push that in so that it is always be there
uh
sorry
i think it's a nice idea to make it more recognisable that the next to the logo you have the slogan
yeah
yeah
i agree
to make more uh of an impression
but not too big
just uh yeah
not too big
no very small
not on the entire back but uh just very small
but readable enough of course
okay
yes slogan from
but we'll uh we'll take that uh with us into the design
company
yeah i think over here the logo
lo uh yeah
on the back
or maybe here in the middle but we'll decide later
with logo and
logo also on
the front but not exchange uh
uh
hmm
uh when
changing fronts
alright that's decided
do you do you see a bit of the of the um
five minutes left
of the uh titanium
o on the front
uh maybe if we make this this this lower part titanium the front is the the upper part and the the bit with the with the l. c. d. screen
yes we could
so
so a bit of titanium between
yeah
yeah
no no betwe of between we can do but but then you have two parts of front two fronts that
that's a bit oh that that's that's pretty cool
no they have two fronts that
no no no no
you have to make this titanium too
you you can yeah
no
yeah
this enti entire bottom
else you you get problems with the l. c. d.
yeah
yeah
yes
like dust in it and so things like that
yeah
when you exchange all the fronts and it's open
i already have uh all kinds of uh
no you can you can just and then not a straight line but uh some sort of wave or something
filth between the mobile
and then the lower part is titanium
this is titanium
i think that's nice yeah
yeah
and this is uh
some some kind of wei weight in it
yeah
yeah
round forms
f front
yeah
i like that bit of uh titanium also on the uh
yeah
yeah
with the with the curved edge
yep
a bit like uh a bit like your mobile phone
maybe you can show it
yeah
it also has the those two distinct uh
yeah
tada
mm bit like this
yeah
yeah
yeah you can make it go
uh it's uh
round this corner too where the logo is
because it has to be uh there all the time you know
what
yeah yeah
ah
that uh yeah
so round where
so uh a little corner of titanium
maybe a nice touch yeah
yeah that's nice finishing touch you need
oh yeah
yes that also sounds uh pretty uh neat
so this this is the exchangeable part
i think i'm going to buy it
we want it
yeah this is the front
and it's only f twenty five euros
come on
this is the
that's a bit too much but no no no no but i think uh this looks uh pretty nice actually
no that's nothing
the phillips remote uh costs more
of course because it's my design but no our d our design alright
right
my design
taking all the credit
well uh you two are going to work together
you'll get your uh specifications on your uh laptop and then uh you uh
yeah
we'll stay here i guess
but there's a problem
we can't uh take a blank one
or can we
well i think we can i just it's
well we can uh erase an animal i guess
yeah
uh the fourth one
nah that's alright that's alright
but don't erase my cat
yeah o
uh the fourth one is empty isn't it
yeah
oh
i want to preserve it
this one is empty
yeah
you have to empty one huh
oh we have a one
what are you doing chief
so you can uh draw a yeah
alright
yeah i think we have to wait
well i'll get a i'll get the message
yeah until the until the beep goes
no
but i don't uh do we have to stay here or i think we have to return first
no i think uh well you'll maybe you can uh keep your uh laptop here
yeah
maybe
or get your mouse
because it's little bit uh hard to work with these uh plates
the high powers from above will have to tell us yeah
yeah
it's not relaxing
i always have a mouse next to my laptop
i hate these
i i don't have a laptop
yeah touch pads yeah
ugh
we can uh do a touch pad on our remote
yeah right
no just kidding
yeah
dream on
well we have uh b you have to have a bit of humour in the in the discussions too because it becomes too too too too stressy
and in your remote control
so we put a touch pad on it and say ha ha
aha
half
this has no function
yeah
we know you'll you'll you'll hate it but
but uh th youth doesn't care about functio functionality so
no
but they do want some gadgets
it's all about cool things
so that's wha what we're doing
yeah
and it will sell
we will be rich
bless you
well we won't
our bosses will be rich
mm
we've done too much in the previous meetings
too much
yes we've got nothing to do now
well they uh
well that's not bad is it
no
i think that's good
we all had uh our talk and
we agree i guess on uh several thing on most uh on things
mm
its the best remote ever
so
pinball
oh
oh he's totally off again
well
no man
you just have to push harder
yeah you have to push harder
but when i start here
mm
yeah
it's here
so is it
yes but you you get really close to the screen with your hand and i don't think that's
mm
hmm
recalibrate it
nope
where's the good old chalk board with the
yeah
the green board with the how do you call it chalk yeah
we can better uh draw a design on this
yeah maybe
yeah but we can't
maybe if i if that thing is recalibrated we can draw a thing quick and then before it uh
yeah
goes off again
let's go
well
finish meeting now
finish the meeting now
alright now we know what to do so
we'll stay here
um
yeah
oh
or we'll get the email
message
maybe w maybe we maybe w m can we get email here
no get away
huh
yeah
yeah
guess so
um i i'm not sure
maybe you yeah
well you'll have to work on this one
well we'll wait a few seconds and then we'll get an email
yeah
that's a good idea
alright
have fun lads
well
yeah
a happy hol happy holidays
good luck
uh fourth meeting
we have to do what
w what
some extra deciding
well
alri alright
oh
we'll see
i'll show you the notes again
very interesting
well you'll you two will uh present us your prototype
yeah
then um i guess that's your bit
yeah
i i didn't s see anything about it so i already uh thought you uh you were to do that
so the you're uh
i'll show you how we're going to do with financing this uh design
mm
yeah that's important too
bit late
yeah
and then we'll evaluate after after we have redesigned it
because uh well we'll see about the costs
um we'll uh evaluate our p our uh production
and then uh we can close
alright
well the finance uh we'll do later so um firstly uh i'll show you the notes
i don't think it's very interesting
i think it is
oh nei
uh no
alright
this is copy paste
so
from me of course yeah
of course
you had some very strange layout
well from us all yeah from all of us
yeah
it's a nice chorus yeah
well um
we ge we went through the agenda and well we had some uh some presentations from you three
and uh i summarised what you said to us
so uh i don't think it's very interesting and go through it again
repeat it yeah
so uh
alright
this is what we decided
it's also copy paste from what we made together
so we still know that
okay
and then uh we can we can uh use the time better
well uh next you two will uh present uh the pot prototype for us
alright we both uh will
yeah
or one of us will
alright
uh
no you go and i'll uh
alright
if i make mistakes uh you'll uh
supplement you
yeah
correct
right
uh well this is our design
uh it's pretty uh much uh like uh mike draw uh drew uh the in the during the last meeting
with uh the different uh perspectives of it
uh we'll begin uh with the front
we have of course uh the the round shape uh the round uh basic shape
um with uh the upper part being the front
th so there's this part um which is made of hard plastic the front
and uh we're we're using different colours
of course for the launch we use the basic ugly colours and later we'll put out uh more interesting covers with different patterns and pictures and everything
yeah
mm-hmm
but basically different colours bright colours not black too dark
fancy colours
um then we have uh the lower part
of the of the device
uh which is of course um part of the back actually because it's also titanium
you can see it also on the on the on the side view that only this part is the front
and the rest of it the under uh the under side uh of it
yeah the back side and the lower part of the front is of course titanium made of titanium and has the titanium colour of course the look
um then we have uh on back on the front uh the logo in the upper corner
mm
uh which is uh made uh which is also part of the back part of the titanium uh titanium part
yeah it's a double r. but
yeah
it's a double r.
it's a double r.
yeah the logo uh uh it's difficult to draw so small but it's our double r. uh logo is in there
but it's very difficult to to draw that in yeah
yeah alright
okay
yeah
um so that's the logo in the upper lef uh right corner
then we have the buttons
uh it's difficult to draw again the little oval or round i think oval will be better for the for the d for the different uh channel buttons
oval yeah
alright
so uh oval n those are here
and then we have the m
the m
channel up and volume
yeah the the con the the the yeah the t volume and the channel controls uh in the middle here
um um with kind of arrow shapes which makes it also a bit more exciting than basic round or um uh
uh square buttons
and also here are the two uh buttons we agreed on
we have the okay button
oh nei we uh the okay button's here in the middle of the of the operators of the channel and uh volume um changers
yeah
mm-hmm
and then we've here the menu button and the
alright
menu for the l. c. d. screen
and the video button
the yeah
mm right
so
and of course this low part this is the l. c. d. screen
'kay
uh this is what we made of it
you can make uh suggestions uh if you want
well if i look at it the side the side view
well at the back
maybe we maybe we should finish first uh our talk and then you can add suggestions
yeah
oh yeah alright
maybe i i don't want to i don't want to suppress you but n i'll uh finish this uh quick
yeah
um okay i've had everything i guess on the front
no the back
with the logo and our uh l uh
yeah the back
yeah
we thought about yeah uh the back is of course totally titanium
and we thought about the logo big in the middle
mm-hmm
just so again the double r.
we have then the logo on front and on the back
mm-hmm
maybe that's too much but you have to say uh say that if you think that way
okay
no i don't think
and the company slogan we thought in a kind of arc shape uh above the logo
and the
yeah
yeah
that's basically what we were thinking about and
okay
and about the side view um
w
this the front won't be as thick but again th the the drawing technique makes it very difficult to to really uh
well i see but
oh and uh before i forget
well
yeah the the voice of course the voice recorder is uh at the bottom
yeah i see it
yes
and you can record it uh using yeah the the the back of the f w device
when i look at uh when i look at this side view i think w when i have that in my hand it's terrible
well it won't be visible
mm
if if you look if if this this is thick and this is thin th th then it that it lies over your hands
why
well it fits uh it it it it fits the hand mean uh the the the the
but
yeah
yeah i agree
well what what what i what i agree is that when uh when um you have such of uh an arc in the middle
so that the the a the ends and the
fronts is a bit thicker so th then it falls over your hands
if y
if you handle a remote you you usually don't have your hand straight like this
in the middle in the
you you have it a bit uh yeah
it depends on the size
if it's kinda small this is is great
but if it's it's larger then you want to grab it
and how large is it
yeah
yeah that's the question
that's the question
uh well yeah
h what do you suggest i mean we do
this was mike's prototype and y you seemed to agreed on it
well uh
but now you have a totally different
well the sides i haven't seen yet uh
well they lay there all the time
the size
yeah well the size doesn't really matter w i mean side
they the the the the the side view we didn't uh
uh oh the side
w we we he drew the s the side but you d you weren't paying attention as usual
yeah yeah
well any case we'll discuss it now
uh i think uh this is a pretty good uh good idea
yeah i agree with the l. c. d. screen
you have it in your palm like this and you can watch uh watch the screen
and if you have it li in the middle your hand might be over it
yeah
but you you hold it like this
yeah you you don't you don't grab it you you
you're not holding it like this or something
you yeah y how do you call it
yeah
well y y y you don't have it like this
you have it more like this
no no no
you you you're using buttons this way or if you're right handed this way
like you're holding your telephone
yep
yeah
so you yeah
because if you have a screen on it you wanna look at your screen
so
hmm
yeah well
that way it it falls into your hand
i think
okay
yeah i agree on this
and maybe you can you can grab it a bit higher so well
no i don't think so
that's not uh the point
no but but
well the the well that's a reason to to to put the l. c. d. screen uh of course on the upper side but
well f for as far as i can see three of us agree and only nils
yeah well uh i think uh if you t if you three uh agree then then that's it
but you're the project manager you can make the hard decisions
yes
so uh i c i c well we'll we we'll do it like this
if necessary
but uh are d can you live with it
uh
yeah
alright if you think that that's the way it should
y yeah y y y y you said it was totally uh unusable
no no when i i my personal taste is that i want it to fall over my hands with a thick but
but do you
but d you don't think this is completely unusable i guess
in the market uh
i think
no not totally
not totally well
for me i i wouldn't buy it
let's say it like that
yeah but of course y you are also human
we have to take uh every everyone into account
no
and you might be uh you might be target customer
so
yeah
well uh who who else thinks like you
yes but
mm
we don't know
maybe a thousand people or a million people
yeah we don't know but that's uh that's that's that's more market research
so let it be like this at uh at this moment
let it be
alright
okay
so that's that
uh any other suggestions
no i think it's great
yeah
but what about the redesigning
comes to that later
okay
um you
uh c you can uh walter
you're very personal again
alright
you can do the evaluation uh criteria on this
great
that's more useful
than just speaking
well this is just a short intro
i'm going to do uh the ev evaluation
yes
that's gonna be done at the end of seven point skill criteria
so i made a i made a few questions on the hand of uh uh the impor most important requirements and trends
mm-hmm
and we have to look if our uh if our device uh is working correctly
well i put some questions in a word file
see if i can find them
uh uh uh uh mm
'kay
well
hmm
i uh think you have all seen uh this kind of evaluation so uh i don't have to explain it
uh the first question is uh is the device good looking
because normal p uh most people thought that um earlier devices were ugly ugly
seventy five percent of them
so what do we think
well d we designed it so of course we are very
mm
yeah we're we're not quite uh objective about this
yeah
yeah
no i know but i have to uh evaluate it
well we designed it to be good looking
so i have to take this questionnaire
so and we ha we have answer now
to the customers
to potential customers who have to take this questionnaire
yeah
yeah
yeah but i can't can s
nei
oh no
hmm
i know i know i know
but um well we can go uh because of the time uh pretty quick through this
uh do we find it good looking
well we think so
i yeah i think it
uh
yeah
yeah but uh you know
we designed it to be good looking so
yeah
we dis we di we designed it to be perfect
so but we have to be critic critical about it
and i have to uh take all these points and get a average at the end
so we we know where we stand
well one
'cause th there are some things we might have uh bi might have forgotten
well so it's point four
right so
easy to find t
well l well let's start with the beginning just one by one
right
uh is it good looking
well i guess uh i think uh it's uh it's it's um pointed towards the youth of course
two
uh if you look at the design and and the colours and everything
that was our target audience of course
but it's also not completely um
uh u unacceptable for older people i guess
uh it's it's not f a device that
the titanium might be uh f
yeah that's that's uh for older people it's it's more that classical look
for older people
it you put uh put a black front on it or something
so
hmm
uh no
i think yeah they like black of course
but i think they'll uh they they think uh the the titanium look of it is also uh i think it's also good for them
so i think we both uh have uh consider considered uh the youth and also a bit older people
so i think it's very good looking and not only for youth uh young people
right
i think we shouldn't discuss any points points that long because i don't know how how many points there are but uh yeah
right
no
i totally agree
yeah the fourteen yeah
we we have to get get on go through this
right a number please
yeah
is it easy to t change channels
yeah well i think so
so the last one is seven
easy to change channels
um no it's uh
no not false
it's one
oh sorry
yeah right
well uh two
change channels
y well we have to go through it
i think it's uh as easy as uh can be made
uh
right
so i yeah
you how can you make it any easier
the power channel and volume buttons are easy accessible
with two huge buttons
yeah huge is a yeah
yep
two
two
alright
the uh device is easy to find if you lose it
well no
d we d we don't we don't have uh that s
we didn't implement anything about that
well it's easier to find than a a normal black one or something because of the colour
well six then
but
yeah
yeah
six
right
well we don't have the device that beeps uh when you lost it or so but um um
are the functions easy to learn
well w i we do want we have a l f f less of an
we have so few functions so yeah
yeah i agree
and the device r. s. i. sensitive
well i should i think two because the voice recorder is n not self learning
yeah
ah
yeah
yeah
yeah
alright
mm
two
yeah but just do some we we
yeah yeah i agree
i th i th i think this is too time consuming
are we take too much time
uh not not towards you but towards this all
no
th this is
yeah
right r. r. s. i. sensitive
we you have to put it to the customers
r. s. i. sensitive
uh well well a bit so four
four
um
yes
yeah very much
one
one
and features included also one
and one
yeah
uh those uh nine uh is the fancy looking
uh we still think so
yeah
device fancy feeling
and i think fancy feeling too because of the titanium back
yeah cool man
yeah
yeah
right
are there enough technology
yeah well also we have two
yeah
yeah that's great
is the device easy to use
the
yes we have not many buttons
so well maybe two because of the voice recorder
well with the uh three
two two
two three
t
are the trends about fruit and vegetables implemented
f
well in our covers in our fronts
yeah
so yes one
yeah
one or two
is the material attractive
one or two another two
yeah
nah f four i think
four
if you look at this
well it doesn't really resemble any fruit uh that's true
no
but but we have the the the the the sparkly fruity colours of course
oh okay
well three
three alright
okay
and you can also have front with uh with fruit on it
yeah that's true
is the material attractive
but
mm
well the titanium is strong and uh the rest f uh the buttons feel soft
yeah
so i would say at least two
right
okay
well yeah
this is the last meeting
yes but we we have to design much more because there was some irritating account manager coming to me
the average will uh come later
yeah
um
i knew things uh were going uh too smoothly
oh
there had to be some kind of trouble along the way
uh
yeah
yes
well look at the costs at this point
my god
i had to fit it in
it has to go to twelve right
i twelve and a half
twelve and a half
so
well what costs a lot
the sample spea costs four
the what
the
the sample speaker the s sensor
out
that's easy
kick it out
kick it out
the what
yeah
we have to go to twelve and a half
the speaker
the speaker costs far by far the most
oh
yeah w tha that's uh that's a bit an optional option
that's some wrong info man
it it isn't worth it
no
no
no d th no
we could make two different versions one with and one without
it's uh
but for this
it's just extra
kick it out
so zero
yeah
then we go to fourteen point six
what more
well the titanium i don't want to lose actually
batteries are uh quite
no
l. c. three
yeah hand dynamo
y t come on w a remote control has a battery
uh no no no no
um
n
uh well we have a bit of a problem i think
because uh
well well why why why should we use a advanced chip
well be for the l. c. d. uh you had said
the l. c. d. screen
yeah
yeah
hmm
can't we do that with a regular chip
no
why not
because uh that uh y because my information says it
well what what's the difference between simple and regular
huh
what's the difference between a simple and a regular chip
yeah
regular is normal
yeah
and simple
uh well yeah i i read something about it but
simple
nothing
elementary
yeah i i read something about it but it wasn't very clear
well
your part
i d i didn't in include it in my report
what happens if we do
single
well you have to use
a chip
so
well you have to use the advanced chip if you have the l. c. d. screen
how much do we win
we we we why
one
we have very little options furthermore for the
but if you have a regular chip you can't have the l. c. d. screen
yeah
uh well we have to put that in
yeah we need to have the the l. c. d. screen
that that's a fact
well we could say well this special colour that isn't that that isn't there because the the fronts they will buy it
uh
no
the special colour
yeah but no that's n it's not relevant
yeah but it's only one half
nah
uh it d it doesn't
yeah then you s then you only have one half left
yeah you must change the chip uh back
you must change the chip back nils
yeah
uh yeah
but we d then we have to lose the l. c. d. screen
no then the whole concept is uh
yeah i know but that's what my information says
i di i didn't uh put uh the advanced chip in there for fun
hmm
you
no we oh
you can make you can make it cheaper
you have to use it
but if you don't sell
you you we have an advanced chip on print and we have an l. c. display
yeah
i think that's a bit double
yeah
y we don't need both
no the advanced chip is needed to have an l. c. d. display
for the l. c. d. screen
yeah
yeah
says
says his uh that was in the second meeting i think
well uh and what do they mean with curves uh again
because we you have uncurved
well i i did single curve to well you said s double curved uh he because uh i thought it's a b a bit cheaper already
i
yeah
no no no no
we can also make it flat
well
but what what did what do n sorry but what do they mean with the curves
but
is th is this a curve
curved
yes that's curved
one curve
yeah this is actually two curves yeah
yes
it's how you it's how you look at it
no it's one curve
one curve
one curve simple
well then we have a huge problem i think
w t we can never get uh below the twelve and a half
we have a big financial problem
well we make it more expensive to buy
well then we have two dollars less profit
come on if we if we if we make this fifty million they won't hesitate to uh congratulate us so uh
if if you make people brand aware they are willing to pay more
but
but uh i
because we we use a brand at the front and uh i dun at the back
if you have uh lots of uh marketing
people might buy
yeah or we could replace it
if you if you make it cool to have
by the way we also have this one
oh that's just great
oh costs nothing
oh alright
that's nice
hey but uh i think you'll agree that uh that we that now we have this uh screen
plastic is
it's it's very uh not practical to ha to consider this after we have designed the entire thing
yes but i just got it
well that's pretty uh l
why why don't we replace the titanium with uh
that is pretty stupid
n not very practical
plastic coloured titanium uh titanium coloured plastic
well
who
you want to dump the titanium
yeah well if we uh we we have to get cheaper
and make all plastic then we ha then we're there
but i'm n i don't agree
but then we we've got to uh run through the eval evaluation process again
i think
th then you have a ugly stupid l ugly looking dumb remote that that no one would buy
ah no no
it's not ugly looking
the looks remain the same
no i don't think so
y
well i do think so
i think the titanium just uh provided the the tough look and the and the
yes
and the feel and th that it is strong and
feel
and also the the older people will like it because of that
and because i alright it's not our target audience but it's it's useful if it's uh important for old people
yeah i agree
we still we had to focus to get more people from the younger group but not lose the one
yeah
i think the titanium is very important
yeah alright but then we we won't get there
yeah we have a problem yeah
w but you can better yeah dump the l. c. d. screen then
we can dump the special colour
we l we use plastic
and plastic is already in colour i think
i don't think you should dump the l. c. d. screen
well what else
w i mean uh
no nothing
or you shou it's or change the titanium or dump the l. c. d. screen
amen
but i think you could better change uh titanium to hard a hard kind of plastic looking like titanium than lose the l. c. d. screen
yeah
yeah
because you have lots of functions in it too
yeah well yeah
yeah
alright
why can't i
i agree with that
but
so we u we use uh
unfortunately
um
i'll put in the report we that we think that fourteen point one is the l m lowest price you can make a remote for that's trendy d these days
titanium coloured plastic
yeah i agree
so titanium coloured plastic for the back
i i'll talk to the managers
no no no no
w titanium stays there
titanium i thi i think this this is this is e really good re remote
yeah this is good but it it's not good enough
osl
but
so we have to use the ditch the titanium i'm afraid
ah those those account managers what do th d what do they know
well
come on
what do we well what do we know
riot
all we want is a is a fancy design but we don't really consider the costs
yes yes
so
no because we did not know anything about it
if you don't have the money you can't make it
yeah al alright yeah
one and a half euros
but we have to deal with it now
hmm
so s if you don't have the money you can't make it
so
so this is too expensive
so
so
so we have to make it cheaper
titanium gone and add plastic
right
yeah but then we've got money left
and on plastic times two and then we uh are there
well no it's just uh all plastic
no
well alright
no yeah well oh six
huh
it's just free man
a lot of plastic yeah
four
so
no two for the to make it clear
but then we can add the special colour
yeah
as we have money over uh left
yeah
and we still have money left
w
what do we want guys
i want gold plating
yeah right
no no um
i want chrome
well i think uh the case is double curved then
yes
we have we have to uh fill
because you y have that curve and you have that curve
well th that that is the problem
y oh no
w we ha no no no but th that's not f um
yeah well uh
alright
safe
well y we have curves in all directions
well you can you can double curve if you don't have titanium
and that we dropped so it it can be done
so alright
but it's pretty funny
we we do want to reach
twelve point five
but it isn't bad to to to stay at eleven
finance
i mean this this ain't titanium but it looks like it
we get more salary if we make if cheaper than twelve uh twelve and a half
well guys
yeah
guys
we have to dump our titanium and we'll hate the managers for that but now we're going to evaluate our project of uh project project
shoot
objection
pro project
well satisfaction on for example are we satisfactory about our creativity
well i can't get no satisfaction but uh i think it's uh well in in if we consider the costs then this is the best yeah
yeah
i think it's terrible that we got uh those costs at the last moment
yeah
yeah
yeah me too
that's really bad
its it's uh ridiculous actually but
but that that that's that yeah that's a reason but also for our creativity
and uh unrealistic
we had um nice design and then you get the cost and you had to dump all your creativity
well we we we used our creativity but we just had to adapt it to the costs
right
which isn't very practical but that's the way
nei
yeah
uh no
well alright
uh-huh
uh leadership next
terrible
uh teamwork
leadership
leadership
well it's it was very democratic
well
uh yeah well i think so also
yeah
yeah
i al i i've uh filled that in in a the questionnaires uh each time so well the managers were terrible
yeah yeah
so with their all their
useless requirements
but o alright the teamwork
well uh they they didn't think of the requirements
it's the requirements of the user uh i guess
no they said oh we won't d uh we won't uh use teletext uh we won't use the d. v. d.
yeah
yeah but they base that on on the user specifications
alright teamwork
well
well great i think
right yeah
yeah think so too
uh well what do you what did you think about the smartboard
it was a complete disaster
yeah i don't like it
no uh it it it uh it is uh
well
no that's a smartboard and that's a digital pen
yeah
it's also a it's both the smartboards
or not
no it's other way around
that's the smartboard
that's the digital panel
i liked this smartboard but i hated that one
this this this isn't a smartboard right
well it's both a smartboard
that's that's the smart
yeah right
b but you this is just a large t large television
oh they're both smartboards
no
you u you use the
a televi yeah
it's both a smartboard but this one is used for a desktop and that one is used to to draw
yeah but you ca this is just a beamer function
and here on this one you can uh draw the pictures and things like that
well wi w which one did you like
but
yeah
that one
left or right
that one
that one isn't accurate
yeah
it just doesn't work
yeah
you can
but i i think this is meant by the digital pen
yes
th that is so
yeah but i think there's a big distinction between the these th i don't need a smartboard
well i didn't use uh
yeah
we're now talking about the smartboards
nei it it's much m
well we we used that one and we needed it
yeah but give me a beamer
i think
that's uh that's much uh much cheaper
yeah alright but
or install a laptop to a beamer or have this one standing here in an i i like it
right
yeah i like that one but that one is terrible
okay alright
but uh you can uh i i sent it about three times now
uh a green uh board with uh chalk is much more useful than that thing
yeah
yeah
yeah it is
the simple uh sch school board
so
i agree
and uh the digi the digital pen
did uh did you like that one
no
i i didn't use it
i wrote things down but i didn't import it into my laptop
i used it uh just to check it out but uh
yeah
that's the
you you can't send that to anyone because you you've scrabbled something on a page for yourself and then you're going to send it yeah
yeah
it isn't practical
right
well no
w but also y you write things down
and i you can also bring your your your note block
your notepad
so what's the what's the th what's the point of importing it into
yeah
it's no it it's useless
well i i drew this
mm
and i made a mistake
but it it would have been uh useful if i i could show this on the screen
yes
yeah alright
for drawings yes
for drawings but not for personal notes
yeah for drawings
i think that's not very
n notes mm
uh i mean you can bring your paperwork along and p well of course if you have a lot of paper if you've if you've
but
yeah it might be useful for drawings
i i agree on that
mm
but for notes it i you you have to put that in a strict uh you have to put a name standard date and all those things
and notes uh for a meeting are very strict
so if you uh were to write them down for yourself and then put that in your computer you still have to type it over to word
yeah right
so it doesn't d doesn't have any
that stefan use
yeah i understand
but i think uh d this option is only useful if you've got a lot of paperwork
you can't it's not very uh ni yeah well a lot of documents are yeah
no i don't think so
it's it's only useful if you have to draw something
yeah
but then uh it's really useful i think
yeah
yep
alright
mu yeah right
um etcetera
well uh the laptops
yeah great
of course great
yeah
yeah
hmm
can we keep them
yeah
uh
you can
b by my
wireless uh wireless things
thanks project manager
yeah
other uh things we used here
i hated the cameras i hated the microphones
well these chairs man
but no
well did you really uh
really great
did you really take uh take those in account
i half of time i didn't notice they were there
no
no
i haven't looked w one time directly at the camera
so
i don't care about it
but we shouldn't talk about that
well i did
because this is a realistic environment
well w why not
uh etcetera we n new ideas found
right
okay
what kind of ideas for n a future schedule what
for future um meetings you have got
well i missed uh the option to uh
communicate in between
to email yeah
email or chat or something
yeah right
but yeah
chatting and emailing
w well th that's just the the environment they set us up f with
yeah
so
yeah alright but that's one n new idea
yeah i agree
well new ideas found by this
not
nothing
well more more information in the beginning
we don't want this
we hate this
yeah
that's
digital pen is useless
no it isn't
so yeah for drawings
well for drawing for drawings
yeah
yeah
so it isn't useless
but uh two t but uh th then you have to have a lot of drawings
because if i had a company and i'm going to uh buy those expensive huge expensive uh things i and i have to w
well
pay those uh papers uh that are expensive i'm not going to uh
for people who uh sketch th the whole day i can imagine that it's useful
no
yeah
well th then still they they they should have a a nice graphics programme on the laptop
but it's still an expensive uh expensive
because this is huge uh this v very very uh expensive paper
well
well you you can't you can't draw on a laptop like you like you paint of or draw with your hand
yeah i agree
with the mouse it is no
but if w yeah
yeah
well and if
mouse is ju just isn't working if you're sketching
uh indeed
and but what if uh maybe this this board uh smartboard is malfunctioning or someone
but suppose it was working correctly what uh would it be useful then if it wasn't off all the time
well no
i hated to draw like that
a
you you can't draw anything uh neat
really
yeah but he's saying if it is correct and you can draw very yeah very precise
anything you want
any b b yeah
i if it if it would be perfect following
l li li
yeah
well th th then still it's it's it's very expensive uh towards a a just a green uh school board
well it isn't but maybe that thing is uh is
yeah mu
yeah board a school board yeah
yeah but but then you can uh save it in instantly and and and re use it and uh
yeah
yep
i it has it is useful
it saves time
yeah
yeah yeah
this uh if it works correct maybe this thing this thing is just malfunctioning
so uh if we get in uh if we get another one and you make sure it does work i think then it's pretty useful
yep
yeah
because uh yeah you can draw t things quickly and uh clearly for anyone uh in the discussion room
and then you can save it immediately
well they are now
hmm
celebration
it is
so congratulations crew
did you type that
hmm
celebration
se
well
yeah we can go to the bar and uh with our newly earned money
finally my beer
well that's it i think
yeah
um i don't know how long we still have
i dunno how long uh we had for this last meeting
but uh
maybe till four o'clock or something
well dunno
yeah
well yeah it is a bit uh well we still have to make the end report and uh all those things
i have to do that
yeah
you better get started
i di did you um save this one in the folder
oh
no
can you do that
no no no no
no we must save this thing yeah
in the shared map map
but nils you've got some work left
i don't know what you have to do
map is it a good word
the folder yeah
huh
i have to go to a physiotherapy
yeah
oh it worked
two times quick
wow
oh alright
cool
so it is useful yeah
yeah
it is handy
oh great man
no but uh
this is nice
i'm gonna buy one buy one for my bedroom
radical
uh
yeah
d design
do you believe it yourself
s oh
he saved them all ten
well alright
um
well they they wanted everything we produced so
they also want to see my cat and his rabbit and uh
yeah
my big bird
well
your big beautiful bird
where is this
maybe the pen is just uh uh broken and the board isn't
of or the other way around uh
maybe you are broken
yeah i think so too
you know
i think you have we have to make clear to her that we are ready
i think she's listening
i also think so
who is she you're talking about
she already knows
oh you mean our uh coach our f personal coach
she
big brother
our manager
is she also our accountant
yeah
is she responsible for sending that information so late
i don't think so
oh
close your laptop
because then we have to confront her with our
so she can see we're ready
i feel watched
alright
yeah
we put the fashion in electronics but we couldn't because of the costs
let's take this remote into uh production
yeah
yeah
that that's the title of our uh end document
that that's our new slogan
yeah i like that
we couldn't put the fashion into the electronics
blame our accountants
do that
yeah that's a nice title
yeah
but we couldn't yeah
very catching
oh
well i th yeah
i'm sure management would like that
well
she's on the move
i'm going to resign after this project anyway so
oh that's just great
so welcome
the first kick off meeting
what shall we do
first the opening then the rest
what are we going to do
we m have to make a new remote control
it has to be original trendy and user friendly
so we will get back th on that
first we have to make a functional design
after that we have to make a conceptual design and then after that a detailed design
so we'll discuss that later
first we have a look at
so first to we have to make a small painting
what have do we have to do
first you can save the documents
we have to do that every time we make something
you can print it
no
and we have to use the pen and the eraser
so now
we all have to use this one
you have to make your own favourite animal
so i'll make an example
yep
first don't touch that things
you can use the pen
and then you can make um
nice
something
um you can change some things
um format
line and
change it
and you can change the
colour
an elephant
so that's it
so
so and after it you have to save it
okay
now we can make a new one
you have to paint now
oh
so you're next
'kay
well we will try
where it going
hmm
that's uh strange
what is going on
pop ups
what are you what
hmm
what is this pictionary
uh
um
uh a bird
is a it is a it is a
bird
a duck
mm
so
now save
yeah
yes
hmm
now uh blank
blank yes
yeah
yeah
okay next one
okay
whoo
let's try this
uh
yeah yeah
um
mm-hmm
mm
oh
oh not
oh
okay
okay
yeah
no problem
shit happens
i'm not getting anything uh on my screen now
okay
a parrot
wow
ish
oh
he did it before
uh
no no
yeah
okay
nice
oh
very good
uh blank
thank you
okay
very good
so um you can always go back
so
that's it
so that was two
now next
the budget
the b uh we will sell the t at twenty five euros
and we have only twenty of twelve and a half euro to make it
so now we have to think about what we will make
first i wanna hear from you
uh what are your experiences with remote controls
so
uh i will start
f first
uh big one they are uh not easy to use
um i have one set and uh a remote control when i dropped it uh it broke
so that won't be uh our goal i think
no
and uh g big buttons m uh that's easier to use than uh i think
not all the small buttons you don't know
is this positive or negative that uh big buttons
big buttons positive
positive
all all small buttons like when you have uh like a hundred buttons on your remote control you won't know what they're working for
okay
what are your experiences
uh well i think the the the goal of a remote control is that it's it it has an influence on the t. v. set
and that it controls the channels and the the volume
mm
and uh i i i think it's positive if there's a a led uh uh a led on the corner of the of the remote
so that you know it s it still has batteries on it in it
and that if you push the button the led uh gives a light and uh and you see that it's working
and uh yeah
uh
so and do they always have that
yeah but
no no no
but i my my experience is that it it it's convenient to have that
it's easy to you
yeah
okay
yeah
'kay
uh at home we have a t. v. a video uh recorder a d. v. d. player and a satellite receiver
we have uh four distinctive remote controls for that
thank you
that's not really ea easy
help also
so it would be nice if we have one for all
thank you
and we also had a remote control for our radio set
but um i it it had a lot of buttons on it and you didn't know which one was what
and it was uh uh v not easy to use
so we n barely used it
okay so they have too much
so next
hmm
for our own remote control we have to think how do we make it
so what ideas do you have for it for the new remote control
what what does it have to have
the weight
not not too heavy
not too heavy
not much buttons
yes
yeah
bust free
that when you drop it it won't break
like uh some kind of rubber on it
or hard uh hard plastic
uh buttons not too small
uh something like when you uh lose your uh remote control sometimes it happen
yes
uh it between the couch and you can't find it
when you push a but a button on the t. v. then you hear some uh some sort of bleep
like a phone
and then you uh hey there there's remote control
yeah
okay
yeah
so that's
next
yeah well that's that are good ideas
uh
yeah well the led on the corner that that indicates that it's working
if you push a button
um
yeah
and looking on the budget not too expensive uh material
so probably plastic or something
uh
okay
yeah i think it uh from a marketing point of view it also has to look nice
or you won't sell it
yes
and um yeah uh on our website we can see what products we already have
and it should work with as many uh as possible of them
okay
this is it has to be compatible with other things
yes
okay
i have one more idea
just popped up
yes
uh it it won't take a lot of batteries
so you don't won't have to change the batteries uh once a week or uh once every two weeks
no battery use
so more ideas
mm no
no okay
it's only the first ideas
so uh what are we going to do now is next meeting is in half an h hour
uh
okay
next meeting half an hour
um what you have to do
well look on your
and
next instructions you'll get in your email
so
this is the first meeting
see you later in half an hour
yes
okay
okay
thank you
okay
so welcome back
what do do we have to do
so first
i want to say i'm the secretary so i make the minutes
you find them in your in the map in the
from the group
there's the minutes from the first meeting
you'll find the next minutes also there
then
i wanna hear from you what you've done
and after that i have some new product requirements
so and after that we have to make decisions what we will do
and then we're ready
we have forty minutes for this meeting
after that we'll have lunch
so first i wanna ask the
industrial designer to tell what he did
that's my task
so
okay
uh i've
where have i put it
my documents or not
hmm
i've save it on my computer my presentation
yeah on your computer or the
but where
what's the name
uh uh uh
what's the name of it
it was about the working of the remote control
it's the technical function or the functional requirements
nope
not a of
wait
the working design
but i've saved it
working design
but now i don't know where it is
hmm
working design
what is this
product documents
yeah
and i import this until
on the desktop
up
up
one more
up
up
up
yes
my documents
nope
what the fuck is this
gone
well you um nah
nah nah nah
powerpoint
working design
yeah that's the empty one
and
i had one
presentation
of working design
uh-huh
open it
okay here it is
save as
uh it's
desktop
project
project
yeah
save
okay
okay
very good
well
a little later but here it is
okay
so
so okay
it's a little difficult what i'm gonna tell you
it's about the working of the remote control
i just had an half an hour j to study it and i don't get it
make it
now have ten minutes to tell it
ten minutes to tell it
okay
i think it will be a few minutes and first uh i will tell you something about the findings what i discovered about the remote control
okay
the working bout it uh of it
uh then i'll have uh some kind of map and it's the top of the remote control
with a little bit of science uh you i will show that uh in in a few minutes
and then uh what i'll think about it
first the findings
the remote control is a very difficult uh thing to uh to explain to just all of you wh who haven't seen a remote control uh inside
uh there's a lot of uh plastic on it um because its uh not so expensive
and there are uh a lot of uh wires uh which um connect the components in it
the battery and there are um switches and things like that
there's a lot of small uh electronics
so it won't be um uh too expensive to build it
only twelve euro fifty i think uh we will make it
now and here i have the top of the remote control
uh here's some kind of chip
uh on top of this there are uh the numbers
uh you have all on your remote control
and uh the teletext uh button
and uh here's the battery
and when you push the button it will uh will be sent to the chip
and the chip will um send it to all kind of sub components
that's what i said it's very difficult
and after that it will be sent to the infrared
and that will send it to your television
that's a short h uh how it works
uh i think i can uh make it uh difficult but we all
we all don't get it
my preferences
it's uh it won't be uh we shouldn't make it too big
uh also for the cost uh we should only put one battery on it
a long lasting battery
uh also for the cost uh use only plastic
not other materials
also because of the cost uh not too much buttons on it
we can also make uh a button uh with a menu uh button
and then um that that you will see it on the t. v.
and on the t. v. you can uh switch into the menu
that's i think it's easier
mm-hmm
and the bleep signal y uh you told us
uh but we can also use it uh a bleep like something when the battery's empty then there is a bleep
then you'll have to change it in a in a week or something
and also the bleep when what i told you about uh when you lost it
and you push a button and then you hear bleep bleep and we will find it
this is uh just uh yeah
oh oh
two questions
yeah
the battery
you say one battery is cheaper
why
if we w if we use only just one uh small pen light then it will be cheaper than when we use two
yeah but when you use two you can use it two times longer
yeah but then we'll have to make the um remote control uh long lasting
okay so it's the size of the remote control
just
yeah
okay and the buttons
when you use it on the television you've you need the television wh which can use it
yeah
but uh i think this our remote control is for the televisions we uh we sell in our company
s
okay
or is it also for other company uh for other televisions
i think we have to use it also on other televisions though
then this is an option
so
maybe just a menu button to use it on our televisions
and then we make it easier uh for our televisions
and on the other tele televisions you can also use it but then we won't use the
yeah but i don't i think it they are two different things though
we have to choose one
it has to work on o uh all televisions
mm
yeah
okay
then i think uh the menu button uh will only work on the newer televisions
and we will uh look forward and don't make a remote control which for the older televisions
hmm
okay
and i just uh have one more idea
uh maybe it's one of your tasks
but uh to have a trendy remote control we can also um make something like the nokia um mobile phones
to change covers
so if you have uh a trendy half with all red uh yellow and something
and then you can put a red cover on it
hmm
and also different things
yeah
good idea
will this will this add to the cost
yes
uh then it won't be uh will have just one cover on the uh original one
and then you can buy the covers
yes but you have to m uh be able to change it
d does it make it more difficult to design
i think it will be a little more difficult but not too much
mm-hmm
not much
'kay
just like with the nokia uh mobile phones
yeah but there are much more nokia telephones than um these ones
just one
yeah but then we'll have to to just um put five covers on it and see if it works
if it won't works then we'll get something else
then we uh won't g uh go further with it
yeah but are their
profits bigger than their cost
uh a p a a cover made in uh in china it it won't be i guess so expensive i think
yeah but there are also design cost
i don't think when you have a remote control do you change the cover
maybe
would you change the cover
i wi i won't
but maybe i think trendy people or like children where you can paint on it
no
and uh the the children think oh this is my remote control uh i made a picture on it
n yeah but
i think that too less people would change it for good profit
uh
yeah
so
okay
and the other people
um
what do you think about it
yeah it's a good idea
but
if if it yeah i don't i'm not sure if it will make profit enough to uh but it's uh yeah it's uh original idea
okay
yes it is but i don't think we have to do it
no
okay
mm
you're the project manager
okay
yes
that's it
that's clear
okay thank you
so now the user interface designer
oh
that's me
uh
come on
ah
yeah
yes well uh uh i shall give a short talk about the the technical function design
um i thought the the the technical function design was uh to uh for a remote control to to to have some influence on the t. v. set
uh both audio and vide video uh in a cordless way
no cords attached
and uh well it all by pushing a button on the remote
that was from my own experience and uh and uh the previous meeting
uh i find some uh some interesting quotes on the web
uh well the same idea here
uh message to the television
and uh and and and well basic uh operations like on and off and uh switching channels and uh and maybe uh teletext or something like that
uh well these are two uh remotes and that's our uh our dilemma i think
uh
we just heard from the industrial designer how uh difficult it is
but uh shall we make a basic remote control uh just uh swapping channels and volume and uh power button and well nothing much more
or uh uh more functions on the remote
uh maybe more devices you can influence
uh a radio or a v a video recorder uh v. c. r.
yeah well that's our dilemma
um any ideas about that
basic or multifunctional
we'll got back on that later
okay yeah
yeah well the that was just on my mind
yes
so uh i didn't know what uh
what way we would go
mm yeah well that was my uh functional uh talk
'kay
'kay thank you
then it's your turn the marketing expert
okay
uh um m
yeah
um yeah okay
this bit too far
so
so i'm uh gonna have a presentation about um the market about um yeah what people think
uh we did a usability lab test with a hundred persons
and we looked at uh several um things
uh among them design uh d d how d did they like the use of it uh what frustrations they had while using remote controls
uh well what what will be our market
and uh we asked them if we had some new featu features
if um that would be a good idea or not
well our findings
uh our users they disliked the look and feel of current remote controls
um uh they especially found found them very ugly
and um th they also found them hard to to learn how to use it
uh well they also zap a lot
so uh zapping uh should be very easy
and uh fifty percent of the users only use ten percent of the buttons
so a lot of unused buttons
there is more findings
uh on the buttons
which uh buttons find users uh very important and which which not
and how much would they use them
well uh the most used button is the channel selection
and uh we asked them how uh relevant they think uh the buttons are
the power volume and channel selections are very relevant
uh teletext is uh less relevant but also important
uh not important they found the audio uh that's not the volume but uh specific the the pitch or the left or right
uh the screen and the brightness
and uh channel settings
uh th and they also are not used very often
then we have a few um graphs about the market
uh here we can see what the market share is of uh several groups
um as you can see most users are uh between thirty six and forty five
um the the the younger group between sixteen and twenty five is not very big
and to come back on the the swapping uh things uh i don't think uh i i think the younger will be most interest in it
but uh they are not a very big group
um in the we asked them uh how would you like a s a new feature
if you have an l. c. d. on the remote control what would you think of it
now you can clearly see young users say
i will that would very nice
and older user think uh they will be scared of change i think
and they won't like it
and another thing how would you like to have a speech recognition on it
well here we see the same
young users uh think that's an interesting idea
and old users not
uh well we uh found out that there are two several markets at which we can aim
uh the first are the younger the age between sixteen and forty five
uh they are highly interested in the features as you can see uh here
and um they are more critical on their money spending
uh the second group is the older group
aged between forty six and sixty five
they are less interested in uh new features
but uh they spend their money more easily
now if we look back at this graph we can see that among the first group is about um sixty percent
and the second group about forty percent
so the the first group is bigger
well then i come to my uh personal preferences
uh yeah the first question is uh also we have to ask is at the which market do we aim at
uh of course n uh saying we aim at the young group doesn't say that old people won't buy it
but less of them will buy it
um well i uh okay
what i thought um even young people say it's hard to use
remote control
so if you make a remote control that is uh very easy to use
that's especially aimed at this group even uh the young group will also be more interested
and um we can make special features
but uh i think it looks nice in the first time
but when use it uh i don't know what's uh good thing of speech recognition
mm-hmm
um well th uh that's my second point
uh less important functions should be discarded from the remote control
it's about discussion we had earlier
um
you can find most functions on a t. v. set
so uh you don't have to have a lot of audio options or screen options to change the brightness
and such things
um well the design is very important
one thing i did not say i think
is that a lot of users also said then i would uh buy a good looking uh remote control if there will be one
but they found most remote controls very ugly
so the design of our remote control is very important
and uh yeah it should be very zap friendly as most users use it for that
that were my findings
okay thank you
yeah
i have uh one question
if we aim for the younger people um and there will be uh a lot of features like l. c. d. or the the the speech uh f recognising
yes
uh the cost will be a lot of h uh a lot higher
yes
mm-hmm
uh i think we don't have that in our budget
no
do you think
no
and i don't uh i don't think twenty five euros for a remote is really cheap or something
like
no
no
so it's
yeah it's hard to uh
get the younger
uh-huh
group
i think uh the l. c. d. is cheaper than speech recognition
so i think that can be an d good option
mm-hmm
l. c. d.
just the l. c. d.
yes
only the l. c. d.
mm-hmm
so but we'll come back on that
okay
now
oh go on
what d d d um
um
uh we go back on the decisions later
now we have a few new product requirements
first teletext
we have internet now so we don't need the teletext anymore
so
not necessary
next
only for the television
so we don't look at the other things like the radio or something
only the television
third
we look at the age group of forty plus
uh no younger than forty
is a g big group and like you showed n not very much people buy our stuff
fourth point
our corporate colour and slogan must be used
very important for the design
so you can see it on our site
next
um no
we have to make our decisions what we want to do
so like
you said we need the
maybe it's good to put it in a document
now we have to decide what controls do we need
so maybe you can tell us
yeah maybe we can first have a discussion uh on the the product requirements you just uh said
sorry
the the requirements you just said maybe we should first have a discussion about that
yes
yes it's okay
i uh personally think uh teletext is a good option
uh not everyone um who is looking t. v. can go to internet when they want to see the latest news
yeah but we don't use it
it's a new requirement
so it's not my requirement
'kay we'll just have to do that
we have to do this
okay
okay
no discussion about it
okay sorry
then uh
no
okay
unfortunately
so
what controls do we need
who first
well a power button
okay
uh power
uh the well um i think separate channels
so
uh mm channel
but then both the the separate channels
so so uh zero to nine or something
channel
zero to nine
uh volume
volume
maybe it's easy to pick
what was w your one
techno
mine
it's the functional requirements
okay
we had w uh no no no no
where was that example of the
oh mine
johan
that was the the the the the technical
technical
hallo
okay
what do we need
on off
zero to nine
to change to the next channel just one button
to move up move down
yeah that's the channel
d yeah
do we make a menu
menu
uh yes the n newer televisions ha do have menus
uh
uh
m menu
i think um
the
only one or
two numbers
mm yes
and
hello
that's ch
i think it will be um q quite easy to use to have uh uh four arrows
up down for channel selection and left right uh for volume
yes
and uh a menu uh button
and if you press the menu button you get into the menu and you can use the same buttons
but the then to scroll through the menu and to change the options
on the l. c. d. screen
you mean
uh well yeah that depends on if you have uh the menu on the t. v.
or you get the menu on the l. c. d. screen on the remote control
think it's better to have it on the remote control 'cause it it has to work on all televisions
so
yes
but then we come to the costs
we need
n yes
but if we
have this
'kay
but well if you aim at the younger market um a as they as uh s uh as we seen in the usability uh lab
uh they will buy a nice looking um
remote control
and also to find the easy to use uh part very important
so if we have a l. c. d. sh uh screen and uh not too many buttons
i think that will incre uh uh even when it's a bit more cost it will still sell
so now we don't have a lot of buttons
is this enough
mute
mute
maybe in the menu
um
mm
yeah but then it's always uh more than one uh
mute
thing to do
mm-hmm
yeah
okay
maybe more
no
well
then that's all
this will be the buttons
and
i think that's enough for the next phase
so we can go on to
but now we have only the buttons
and uh we don't yet have to decide what the remote control would look like
yes
or
no that's for the next phase
okay
um
phase two is the conceptual design
so then we'll have the concepts
okay
okay
that's for the so uh next point
now we have lunch break
after that we have t thirty minutes for work
and you can find the minutes in the project documents folder inclusive the uh buttons
no
your individual action you can find them in the email
so now it's time for lunch
okay
okay
good idea
thanks for coming
okay
well let's start
what are we doing
oops
hmm
ah pinball
okay
okay
not doing
mm
uh
ah
oh
hey
ah
now i have my screen back too
very good
okay
yeah
we have presentations
so first it's your turn
mine
oh great
yeah
huh
isn't it amazing
yeah
very interesting
uh
industrial designer
interface concept
yes well uh let's uh talk about the interface uh concept
uh first i'll uh i'll uh discuss the buttons we just chose uh show you some samples uh
uh discuss some colours and design maybe already
and uh my personal preferences
well we chose the power button to switch the television on and off
the bu uh the mute button to switch the volume on and o on and off
the channels buttons one to nine and uh off uh uh zero to nine and the uh button to choose uh higher channels than nine
uh the volume and channel quadrants uh left and right up and down arrows to uh do the volume and channel
and the menu menu button to man manipulate the l. c. d. uh display
um i found some uh interesting uh uh samples
examples
um well uh what's pretty standard is uh that it's that they're all pretty uh uh high uh
large
yeah
a lot a lot of buttons buttons
yeah
large and and and pretty thin and uh and long
um power buttons are mostly at the top
uh left or right
um well we see the the the same uh
arrows
like there
and uh
yeah well arrow b buttons can be blue
and what's interesting is the the the icons on the buttons
some buttons have icons like the play and stop but we don't use that
but uh these we we have to choose the right icons or or letters
uh this is the v. for volume but they're both uh a v.
so it's it's not really very uh clear what's the function of that
yeah
um
yeah
so that's
can you go back one page
for the uh menu what do we use for that
uh well
we don't have buttons for the menu
or we may have to use channel of the volume and channel
yeah
i thought that was our uh idea
okay
so uh how
but uh
you have to put it on the
like this
yeah
or or this
and that the menu button is okay
yeah but has to be clear that you can use the arrows
yeah okay
yes
uh so the
the icons on the arrows as well you mean
mm-hmm
yes
the second one
yeah
uh well that's something to uh think about
okay
uh maybe i'll have something in my uh presentation
and you will see it
okay
okay
um well i don't i don't know if we have to discuss this already or in the next uh meeting
but uh
as we have to uh to to design the the case and the whole uh remote control in our uh our our corporate uh company uh uh colours and the logo
i would uh recommend a yellow case
uh round edges
the logo at the bottom
and uh well maybe each each uh set of buttons uh has uh has his own colour
so it's good
uh recognisable
k so i think
not too much colours
uh no
not too much
but uh no no no
no it's not flower power
but this has to be has to be trendy and uh and
s okay
uh yeah so good uh good icons on the buttons and uh and big buttons is my uh personal uh
opinion
okay
that was that
thank you
so you're next
i'm next okay
yes
no
here we go
uh at first we will uh i will f uh say something about what younger people want
okay
mm-hmm
our uh group w uh w uh we want to uh sell our remote controls to
and then i'll discuss what my opinion is about the costs about uh what battery is in it what kind of buttons also
first uh the younger people they want like soft mat uh materials and primary colours
like totally yellow totally red
uh so it's visible
uh the shapes are curved and round like uh you also said
maybe it's nice to uh get a remote control not like all the other ones straight and uh flat and long
but to give him the shape of your hand so you it's easier to use or something like that
but that's just an idea
and then
i'll have to discuss about the costs uh of all the things for the remote control
the battery there are few options
uh i think the best option is to use uh the basic battery
so everybody can buy it uh at the at the supermarket
or use uh a k uh kinetic battery like uh within a watch
when you uh shake it a few times it it's loaded
uh the the form of the remote control i think it's also nice have it curved
and maybe like it's hand shaped
uh so uh you take it here in your hand and here are the buttons
uh material you use plastic
hard plastic uh because uh it won't have to burst uh like in the in one time
and also rubber because the younger people like that what we see in the research
uh the push buttons
we have one new thing uh discovered
it's a scroll push uh thing like a mouse
maybe it's uh easy to use uh for the channels
when you want to go m move up you just scroll up and click on the button
if you wanna see the next uh if you wanna see that channel
and also for the mouse uh for the volume it's also uh easy to use
just scroll a bit up scroll a bit down
and that's also easy just w when you have a thing like this and you get it here
you can do it with your thumb
and with your l left hand you can uh push the buttons uh if you push uh channel one you can see channel one
hmm
the electrics um with a scroll push uh button we must use regular uh chips
there are also uh simple chips
they are uh cheaper
um but then we have just a basic uh uh remote control
and i think there are a lot of those uh things and people won't buy it any more
they have seen enough of it
and you have also advanced um chips
but that's with the l. c. d. uh screen
and the costs will increase a lot more
and i think our budget is too low to use and an l. c. d. and the chip who is more expensive
and maybe it's also then uh thoughtful if we u uh use uh as um different kind of uh shapes for the for remote control
that we then use the primary colours
like you get a yellow uh remote control red one blue one et cetera
you have any more questions about this
i think the main thing is we look at the costs
yep
hmm
and not too basic not a basic remote control who everybody already has
yeah
but thi i uh this is with an l. c. d.
no not
not with an l. c. d.
no isn't
no
but the l. c. d. is easy when you use the scroll uh buttons
then you can scroll you see what number and then you push
yeah
but then what i say the costs will uh get a lot higher
but then it's not easy to use scroll uh
wheel
th then you'll see it on the television
if you don't
hmm yes
but then
yeah then you go one down one up
when you scroll
yeah but l when you see a menu uh on the television
it's like you see uh one to twenty you go uh uh s scroll up and push number tw twenty
yeah but like we said before it has to be used on every television
so you may not be uh
no
the television must do that
mm-hmm
so
yeah i think the younger people will have newer televisions which
can provide our uh remote control
yeah but young people have to have all their uh room
and mostly they are smaller
yes
so
but that won't be a problem
i think
most the times that are not advanced televisions
no but then we'll get to the regular uh remote controls
and i think what i said everybody has them uh has them already
and they go to a uh supermarket and buy them uh for two euros
uh and ge and get the most cheapest uh thing
and i think we must look further to uh to devel d develop something news
okay
uh can you give an indication in b uh in the cost difference between uh the chip with l. c. d. or without
i got it on my screen and it was uh higher
but i don't know uh how much higher
'cause it i think if we have an l. c. d. it will also sell a lot better
that's important
that's true
and that might uh bring back the costs uh
but then we'll i think we must discuss who uh what will be better
if we have a better shape of the um remote control or better options on it
with a scroll menu a w scroll thing and a l. c. d.
and then a flat um remote control
or a more hand shaped remote control with scroll without l. c. d.
yeah
maybe you can look how how much it is for the l. c. d.
i can uh look on my uh
it's very important
uh
note that the push button requires a simple chip chip
a scroll wheel requires minimally a regular chip which is a higher price range
the display requires a advanced chip which is which in turn is more expensive than the regular chip
yeah more expensive
but how much
doesn't say
oh
huh
hmm
okay
that's from my manufacturing division
okay
'kay
well thank you
my turn
yes
next
mm
so
so
yeah
so my uh presentation is about trend watching
uh i did some trend watching
it's very important to uh keep up with latest trends
'cause if you don't you won't sell
so well how we did do that
uh well we made an investigation of the market by trendwatchers
they uh watch in uh cities like uh paris and milan
of course well known for their uh trend uh trends
and well uh what did you find
uh we have two groups young and trendy and the old and rich
well th and the young and trendy they uh they starting to like uh fruit and vegetables uh as a theme for n uh clothes
shoes and also uh products
and um material
that should feel have uh a spongy feeling
and to get a feeling for what it is uh here is an image of it
then the old and rich
they like uh dark colours and simple recognisable shapes
and um they also like uh familiar material uh especially wood
now another picture
to get a feeling for this
well uh then already come to my personal preferences
we uh aim at the younger market
so we should also be uh look at their uh trends
however with trends it's always if there's it's now
it it it might last one year and next year it be uh can be totally different
and i think we want to sell our product for longer than one year
so we m must not just only look at what the trend is now as it might be totally different next year
so that's uh one thing to keep in mind
changing covers
yeah
any questions
nope
no
no
it's clear
so now
it's uh ah let's see
now w we have to decide
well we have to decide on the concept
so we have to look at
's next
components and user interface concept
so
now we have to make some concept
maybe one of you can paint it on the board
first uh user interface
uh uh uh
how w how we how we make it
uh
yes a concept on uh just
shouldn't we first discuss about like what w we all
yeah
yeah but maybe we can paint it
uh what do we want
yeah but if i paint with
i'll paint
okay
well
mm
something like this
or
mm yes
shapes or what do we need
can make several uh concepts
what
yes okay
we have this and we had the idea of an um a more uh uh uh like sh in the shape of your hand
okay
more like something
yeah i i i uh yes
m like yeah i can't dr i can't draw it
uh i have to
and you have to
yeah
i'm not a designer
it's more three d.
like um when you have
a part here
this is the remote control
and then you have something like
th this under it
so it's easier to get it like this
mm
yeah
yeah
it's like a gun
a g mm
so it has to be soft
and it has to be soft yeah
okay
so you can squeeze in it and sorry
and uh the buttons
buttons
buttons on top of it
and here
the scrolling
you can do it with your thumb
no it won't
but but i that's the only scroll uh button on it then
but now we use one scroll button and the other one is here
one till uh uh zero till nine
but well there one for the sound and one for the channels
yeah okay
but but how
yeah
and the b
yeah
yeah
how
or two buttons
okay
and i if we go to uh
uh two scroll uh wheels
if uh 'kay c if we do if we use one then we'll have just a switch on it
and you'll just switch it and now it's the sound to switch back
mm
that's th that's more difficult
but if we have uh a me yeah
it's better in
if we have a menu uh how do we uh choose other options
with the menu uh button
and then you also can scroll uh scroll in it
just not like all the other ones with uh this thing and uh here an arrow here an arrow here an arrow here an arrow
yeah
because uh from h hundred uh remote controls ninety nine have it
but if we don't have a l. c. d. we don't have a menu
yeah
uh then we have it on the t. v. the menu
uh uh
yeah but again maybe th how do we know the t. v. can handle it
you don't know
so there's no menu
i don't know
it's like some sort of uh teletext option but we don't have teletext
no
so you can't use it
and if we put an l. c. d. thing on it then the costs will uh be much higher
okay we make two concepts
one with l. c. d.
one without l. c. d.
'kay
but you all like this kind of thing
uh
good concept
but
with the scroll button
that's one
and and this one has to be soft
uh uh
and this has to be harder because when it falls it mu mu must not burst
or some kind of rubber around it
mm-hmm
it's one
two
number two
and you can and you can uh make the the power button as a trigger
yeah
like uh
yeah
ah that's nice
here
trigger
no
just to uh
but when you handle it you put it on and off
it's not good to use
yeah but i'll zap
oh like a
yeah
fuck
out
no it's not good
yeah
now second concept
one with l. c. d. one without l. c. d.
then uh
paint it
paint it
with the scroll thing on like this
one with two scroll buttons and one with without
yeah
uh one with a with a menu and one without a menu
so
and the one with with a menu has an l. c. d.
draw it
unbelievable
do i have to do everything
blank
you have
not so difficult
yeah
but if you put push the the menu button
uh that's the menu
yeah wh what
there for the l. c. d. screen
yes but you don't know which of the scroll buttons you have to choose
you have to
for the menu
yeah
mm-hmm
one
that way
and one
that way
so
then it depends on the cost
s on and off
but is it easy to use
when you have it on your left side and
when it's not too big
just like a a phone
mm-hmm
m uh yeah maybe it's better if the uh scroll wheels are um more separate yeah
separate more separate h yeah
yes okay
like you have the menu button in between uh
yeah
on the left a scroll button and on the right a scroll button
but would it be easy to use then
if it's like you have a big uh
very good
is it better
when you uh the menu you have to go there there there there
i also think this concept is not what the young people were looking for
yeah
they were like round curves uh different uh
yeah okay
that's that's the outside
okay okay okay
but now the first the buttons
mm-hmm
think we have we have now two buttons missing
the uh um
the mute button
sorry
we have two buttons missing
the mute button
and um the to to uh have to uh numbers
mute
and the other
okay
yeah
not so difficult
but uh
personally i think two scroll buttons uh aren't easy to handle
but how do you wanna solve it
with the switch button
yeah but on the menu that's not uh easy
then you go down you switch you go into the right you switch you go down
no like uh
oh you mean like that
yeah
uh then you can also have like uh th um
a joystick
yeah and joystick i think
yeah
but is it uh
does that break a joystick
or a small one just like in a laptop
yeah like in a laptop s uh s some sort of thing
a little bit bigger with easier thi
mean it's better
but how expensive it is
i don't know
oh
why do i pay you for
um well um
better ideas
okay
or no scroll uh things
just a shape
and no no
for the young peoples i think scroll button's good
it won't work
yeah
uh-huh
so
think we have to keep them
or a remote control more like joystick
yeah but is it that's not expensive than uh joystick is better
a small one
a small one like this like a nintendo uh k
no just like in a
playstation thing
a laptop
small round
then it's
not so big
no no no
i mean the the shape of the remote control
oh the sh yeah but then you can you have to use t with one hand
just like a playstation thing
yeah
so
maybe if it's possible it's not too expensive i think a joystick is better
a small one
so please look at it
no that's okay i got
and on the l. c. d. how much it costs
uh it costs extra
uh they're not uh
in details
it's more expensive or less expensive huh
yeah we i think you get it
so after this meeting you have half an hour to uh fix it
then i have to come with it
yes
i got my personal costs
i i don't i don't know the costs
your problem
not mine
then i'll uh make something up
okay
so do we have other concepts
then for the components
we use a normal battery
mm yeah
then it's
ch cheapest way i think
yeah or the or the kinetic uh with normal battery
no no kinetic
yeah i think it's uh yeah more expensive
kinetic is uh ch makes it more expensive
yeah
so we use a normal battery
yeah
yeah
okay
yes
chip
depends on the l. c. d.
depends on the scroll
scroll
if we use a scroll then we have the uh regular chip
if we don't use a scroll then we can use the simple chip
and that's
yeah
and uh we if you use the l. c. d. we have to
uh the most expensive
yes okay
yeah
so depends on the l. c. d. and the scroll
if we yeah
okay
if we no okay scroll wheel
so i have this
so it will be uh the advanced chip or the uh regu uh or the regular chip
okay
so uh the shapes of the
design
depends on the l. c. d. and but
it has to be small
i think
or shall we just put it on the pistol thing
and then just put also on l. c. d. on it
if you have pistol it l. c. d. 's not easy
y y yeah but
just use your thumb
if you use a phone
if you yeah
k yeah but but then you have it
i use my thumb
like th if you have pistol you have it so
yeah
and the screen is
well then you have to keep it this way to look at the screen
if you have a joystick on
no if you have like uh an uh uh a ni a uh playstation uh game controller
yeah
and you move up f forward down left
then you have uh just yeah a little bit curved
it's not just uh straight
no
no no
that's how we use it
uh
that's why they make joysticks like that i think
yeah but then you look forward
uh yeah but
and then you can y
yeah
yeah
n well if you have to look at it
if you
'kay
here's our designer
if we have uh then something standing here with the l. c. d.
yeah
then it goes like this
yeah why not
if th n well
it's for the younger people
yes of course
it's something new
it's uh
that's good good
but the um it may not break
now we put uh rubber around it
okay
if that's possible
um yeah
hard plastic uh the shape and around it hard uh around it rubber
and the uh the hand shape is also rubber
okay
i can't see the
or you can uh
turn it inside
but uh the easy of uh th the ease of use wasn't uh the most important uh aspect of it
but that's
huh
no that's true
uh for us it's about to sell it
uh
yeah of course
this is something new
okay
then this is the design
and the buttons are on the next page
so depends on the cost
so um we have one minute
costs are okay
one
i think
no
no
you have more
more
seven
you have still ten
next meeting
thirty minutes
so hurry up
oh that's us together
you two stay here
paint it
okay
now you have to
so
i think it's clear
check your mail
so
yeah
yes
it has to be ready in the next meeting
so
what
cookie
okay
next meeting is called the detailed design
so
everyth everything has to be ready
okay
thanks for your attention
'kay
see you at the next meeting
bye bye
okay
so now um last time
can you uh push the button
one time please
so
i'm still the secretary
now uh i ask you to presentate the prototype
one of your you two
i don't care
oh this you mean
huh
yes
the prototype
yes well uh
this is it
this is it
well thank you
uh now
it's uh it's uh it's yellow
and uh this is rubber
and and and this too
the
the sides
yes
and the rest is hard plastic
and uh
we uh we had some uh we had a new idea that that this can uh can be uh uh turned inside
and then it covers the these buttons
okay
until here or something
yes
and then you can still use the the power button and the mute and the the joystick
mm-hmm
so you can still operate uh all the things
because you don't always use the menu
and then it can break
okay
and the buttons
uh well uh
big
big buttons
and everything is blue except the power button
and the mute
of uh yeah and the mute and the the other button
yeah
channel higher channel button
yeah
and the joystick is for the volume and the channels
uh yes
yes
yes that's uh
very obvious
up is channel up
down is channel down
to the right is volume up
to the left is volume down
yeah
okay so if joystick and l. c. d.
what's the r. r. d
the r. r.
r. r. 's the l the the the the company uh logo
okay
very good
so we have
that's on the rub rubber part
uh yes
yes
that's about here
so what they say on the side is put fashion there
yes
it's good
oh
so that's it
yeah
that's prototype
now the finance
we don't know if it's th it if it's okay
alright
so i'm gonna look
do we do we change the
we have sorry
do we change the the order
or are we going to uh ev evaluate it first
finance is um yeah it's
no first uh
yes
we have to evaluate the product yet
okay
sorry
that's uh um that can be none
um we gonna do the evaluation now together
but i have uh a introduction how it works
so it will come up
uh oh
okay
um yeah
well we uh uh i have um thinked a few evaluation uh criterias
uh based on um our marketing strategy on uh the latest trends on user preferences
uh we have a seven point scale from uh true as well
to false seven
and on base of each c uh criteria we need to um give a rating
we can uh well it look like this
but we gonna uh do it here they said
so you hope found out how to do it with a word document
yeah
okay yeah
yeah
um well uh we have the word document
criteria
you so we open up that blank here
um
think i can uh what this just an example
so this not very important
but um if i can
get a number in here
hmm
no it's okay
well uh we can't do that
i'll get it
oh it's okay
um so uh you have to think of it as uh the remote control is techno technologically innovative
uh and then we have to uh agree on the rating together
and in the end we will c uh count an average
of all rating
the first uh on each item
what do you think
yeah i think it's uh uh well technologically using it's not uh it doesn't contain many new features
only the l. c. d.
so it um i think i will give it a yeah yeah yeah a four
hmm
i think the scroll button is something also uh new
what uh not anoth uh not a lot of uh a lot of uh remote controls have
i think technologically i'll give it an
seven
si six six
yeah
sorry six
so now i i think you uh see it um its statement
and you true or false
oh true or false
oh uh i'll i'll give it uh a t a two
and true is one
so yeah
yeah
sorry
two
you
three
me too
so it's a three
'kay
um well
it's a one
the first item
so okay the second item
um this product is for all sorts of customers
mm
well it's a statement which uh i disagree with
because we uh really aim uh at at young market and i think the way it looked uh c uh totally in yellow
it's not uh really aimed for all customers
it doesn't look like that
so it's a
that's uh a six
five
mm four
yes it's for the
younger g group
yeah but it's it's
so it's uh half half of the people
so i think it's four
yeah
i mean it still has l large buttons and not m many buttons
so i mean the colours are for young people but
mm-hmm
no
yes
so i think it's four
older
yeah
maybe version uh three point o. uh has other colours
yeah
maybe
okay
give it a four
four
four
yep
uh okay
mm
we put the fashion in electronics
that's uh the motto of our company
yeah well do we do this with uh this product
i um yeah
i think if we do this as it's uh uh c uh it's really orientates on the design
um so i would give it a two
me too a two because only the battery is not uh
techin uh technologically high standard
but the rest of it is
so i think a two
yes
two
two
uh i say uh a five
it's not fashion it's new
it must be a fashion
but it isn't
it it will be fashion
yes
it w if it's not a fashion
we can put it in it
so it must be a fashion
i think it's a five
uh okay
then make it th three
okay
yes i'll think of that too
no
'kay
oh
three is okay
yeah agree
i use my feet though
oh we'll wait outside
a three
okay
yeah okay
the next element um is the product looks good
well personally i do not prefer a um remote control that's fully in yellow
so i would give this a five
i give it a one
yes a one
i like it
well i say three
so counting then is two and a half
we have to do our uh two or three
say two
okay two
two
two
okay
so well we gonna do the next part
uh yep
uh uh the next statement
it has not too much buttons
um yeah i i have uh said is not because uh a low number is better
and in the end we calculate an average
so um that's why it's a negative in it
um well this one of our aims not have too much buttons
so um uh did we uh do that
well uh if we go to uh this fashion i we still have caused uh a lot of uh buttons for the numbers
but you can you can go for that
and um that way you don't have a lot of buttons over
so i would give this a two
one
you
one
me too
one
one
um but where where is the
next six
it does not get lost easily
so
yeah did we implement uh the sound
uh just a small thing
yes
no we did not
yeah but uh
so but can it get lost if it's such a thing
yeah
ah
i don't think so
yellow
looks like a pistol
yes
not a not a normal shapes
uh
so
it won't get between uh the pillows uh on the couch
no
it won't get lost
yeah
so
uh
it won't
a one
yeah o one
yeah
okay a one
one
next
okay um well we aimed for the younger market
uh yeah did we achieve that
i think with the way it looks and um it is designed i will give it a two
yeah me
yeah
me too
that was our target
two
two
yeah
yeah
yep
yeah
right
there's a fancy look and feel
uh yes
that that was uh yeah one of the most important things that uh trendwatch said
i didn't uh say it in my presentation
but um well does it have that
i would say yes
so um
well let's also give this a two
t
i gave this a one because of the rubber
it feels soft
uh it looks like a l uh uh b uh a bit like a joystick
it's yeah
yeah f very fancy trendy
okay
yes a one
i say a two
it's a a bit personal
yeah
if it's fancy
so i think s two is better
yeah okay
okay
two is okay
two
and um then the last one i could think of uh it goes with the latest trends
no it's new
innovation
if we looked at the latest trends for the uh younger people and they ate uh fruit and vegetables
well it has a um a nice colour uh well compared to food but we didn't uh
we did not paint any uh fruit and vegetable on it for something like that
oh
so i would did not give this uh a one or two
i we'll go for a three
i go for two because uh the the shapes are still round
uh the latest trends are soft things you know like uh i said in my presentation
yes
uh
but the the colours are um basic like yellow red um blue
something what also younger people want
it's also a trend so i'll give it a two
okay
mm three
me too
three
a three
yeah
okay
so um come back to the presentation now
so we find yourself there and now we have to calculate an average rating
so we will do that
effort is three ten and twelve
yes
thirty forty fifty
twenty one
so it's uh two and three nine two and one third
by nine
two
yeah
um uh okay
two
yep
come on
uh nah
okay
so uh that's a pretty low rating i think
yes
so it's good
so according to our uh own evaluation uh we did a good job
okay
thank you
yeah i think
oh
nah
how am i doing
yes
and i closed your slide show
okay
back to my uh
which one was the last for you
uh dreaming
yep
next please
next
so now uh we have a product
finance
very happy
but uh is it cheap enough
um so if uh i'll have a look
we have a battery
one battery
mm-hmm
cheapest there is
okay one battery
electronics
advanced chip
expensive
yeah it's the most advanced
chip on print
we have that one
well it's the most advanced
we have the simple regular and advanced
advanced
we have the adva advanced
'kay so uncurved or flat
nope
single curved or double curved
we have double curved
so
then we have plastic wood rubber
we have half rubber half plastic
mm yes
no titanium
special colour
yes yellow
yeah
uh yellow
mm yeah
interface push button
scroll wheel integrated scroll wheel push push button or l. c. d. display
so we have the l. c. d.
we have two scroll wheels
or one
one
one
and it's not really a s
joystick uh thing
yeah it's this one
now uh button supplement
special colour
we already uh that's the from the for the buttons
the buttons are regular colour
mm yeah
so then uh then then then then then then
then
we're not gonna make it
uh no
it's too expensive
yeah
wh
so we have to change something
what what are the costs
fifteen euros
fifteen
yeah well uh when we lose one scroll wheel it's okay
'cause we can't lose the battery
we can't lose the advanced chip
we can't lose the double curve
we have rubber special colour
we would have uh n
a special colour
uh i don't think it's a very special colour
oh no we no it's uh
sorry
yellow
uh is it a special colour
for a remote control
what
i've for a remote control i think it is
yeah
if we would have uh uh normal buttons instead of uh the joystick
for up down left right
um then we uh lose
two euros
then we have thirteen euros
half a euro too much
exactly the special colours
and what if we use only one sort of um
so
um just only plastic or only rubber
that's one euro
one euro discount
so i don't think that's good
mm
i think we have to keep the l. c. d.
if
if we change the joyst uh the joystick thing into a button up button down button right button left
yes
then it's
only thirteen euros
and then we'll lose fifty cent in what
so uh yeah
yeah
then you have or you have to cut this off
uh uh uh
then it's not good anymore
no
so wait
okay
i'll have a look
we
and if you say it's just a r uh normal colour it's a normal colour wh no one will see it
yellow rubber
yeah normal
normal colour and the the joystick away and put the button up button down right left
uh
and it's twelve euros i think
one minute please
uh is it maximum
um
yeah it's normal colour
but if you lose the
joystick it's still uh an advanced chip
no
uh no no no
or it's then a regular
uh
oh wait wait wait
the advanced chip was for the l. c. d. wasn't it
yeah
oh yeah
so the advanced is for the l. c. d. and the regular for the joystick
oh yeah
yeah
yeah yeah
and what if we lose the l. c. d.
if we lose the l. c. d. then we have an uh regular chip and no l. c. d.
yeah regular chip
but
is it a good design
uh yeah
then you'll have to m uh see the menu on the television
and you don't have
the l. c. d.
if uh
so the t. v. s has to uh have to be up to date
if we have the n no buttons if we have we have uh not a joystick but buttons we would have uh we have thirteen euros
yeah
mm yes
and then uh we move the the colour
what will that be
yeah
then it's okay
huh
no knew that
yeah
okay so no joystick
oh no but we then we get push buttons from half a euro
yeah then it's twelve euro fifty then it's okay
uh yes yes yes yes
no joystick
push buttons
no special colour
twelve and a half euros
then it's okay
so we have to change that a little bit
and you cannot use the red and green button
because if you give them a s uh colour
okay
all the same uh
you have to pay
point two euros
so all the buttons has to have to be the same colour
yes
but then the print on it will g um change it
make it uh
for everybody to see what button it is
uh l how you call it
mm yeah
recognisable
recognisable yeah
like what yeah
yes
mm yeah
so
yeah
okay
okay
so well
now we have to change that but that's okay
rubber
what's the normal colour
oh well that's clear
so
and
where's
yeah
so now it's
and the joystick away
and its buttons
yeah
it is
but then it will be
just that ones
yeah
now it's
still he waited at the
very good
no
now uh project eva evaluation
well
what do you think of it
uh
about the
project
about the project
process
went good
uh
i think uh the creativity uh was good enough
we have a gun instead of a remote control
um
uh leadership
yeah you were the project project manager and uh had the final vote
so yeah that was clear
team work okay
everybody uh has something uh to say about it
and uh no uh o only the the drawing uh was very difficult
but nah
new ideas found
nope
okay
and you
yeah well the same
i i espe i especially uh liked the the means the the smartboard and uh
yeah it uh
it brings up new ideas when you work with uh with it
okay
yeah
yeah i think you have to compare it to if you would have a normal um normal project without laptops uh and without these devices
i think um
well the laptops if you have them out front of you you sometimes looking at that instead of the presentation
um well uh the draw board well you can draw things
but it not really going very convenient
mm-hmm
uh maybe it will be easier if you have a smaller monitor and uh you would also see there
and with a normal mouse
um and uh the project
yeah i agree on what was said uh mainly
uh yeah but you always have that some people are talking more than others
and maybe is then um the task of the the project manager to also uh ask more to the people uh less talking
to tell their opinion
okay
well what do i have to say
i think it was good
not too many discussions
no
so it's good for the speed
no
yep
so i think we're ready
yeah
good price
evaluation ready
ready
beer
that's it
yeah
okay
okay then
good morning flores
g good morning
marketing expert
oh yeah
right
are you ready
you should put the laptop uh right into the square
for the cameras
for i for the cameras yes
alright
good morning sebastian
good morning mister p. m.
i'm fine
how are you today
how was your business trip to boston
um well actually i didn't go didn't feel like it
geez
so do you want to open it as read only
um i guess i should close it here
you have the same message of uh windows cannot um
sen oh stand by
okay
close the the window
okay the waiting is for our marketing expert ruud
so
that's right
ruud
um project kick off
is there a schedule for this meeting
yes there is actually
um i will li list the agenda for today
for this meeting
good morning ruud
good morning
uh it's important um yeah great
i shall close the door
it's important that the laptops are um exactly on the square um for the cameras
okay
okay
um we're here to develop uh a new product
um i'm sure you've had a mail from our account manager about it
mm-hmm
um and um this is the first meeting to to generate some uh uh some ideas about it
um you are here in a specific role
uh ruud is here as the marketing expert roo is here as the user interface designer and sebastian is here uh in the role of industrial designer
is that correct
that's correct
mm-hmm
okay
um we're going to do um uh uh a little tool training uh for the tools we are going to use uh during uh the meetings we are going to have here
um then i will tell you a little bit about my idea of the project plan uh and we will have a discussion
uh this meeting should take no more than twenty five minutes so we should keep that in mind
alright
okay
um is there any room for a little presentation
uh maybe during the discussion uh section
there is
yeah there is
okay
no problem
um okay this new product we are are g are going to develop um
it's a remote control a television remote control
um and first of all it should be original it should be trendy and user friendly
those are kind of easy um uh uh goals um and i'm sure we can find more goals for the for the product we are going to develop
um we will discuss uh later on more ideas about uh how the remote should look and how it sh it should function and all those kind of things
okay
the market we should have a look at the market
um we are going to use a a pred a project method uh during uh this development um which consists of three different design stages
uh the functional design the conceptual design and the detailed design um all of these stages um um mean that we do some individual work
prepare and then uh meet to discuss our uh uh the the the progressions yes
progressions
um the first stage the functional design um we are going to search for the user requirements and we will um make a specific uh specification of that
um the second is the technical functional design um what effect should the remote have
well in this case control t the the television i think
it's for the vision
yeah
um and the last one is the working design
how exactly does it work in the technical sense
um the other design stages uh we will discuss that later
so we'll kop it keep it with the functional design
okay um before we think about remote control we will um work with some of the tools we have uh here
um as you see now i can give a presentation
um it's also possible to use this one as well
you can uh uh display pr uh two presentations if you want to
um
to um presentate
to show us uh a file you'll need to uh place it in your project documents folder which is on your desktop at least it should be
um then we have this electronic white board system
um
yeah i will show that now
um
you can draw on the board using this pen
there are little um uh sensors so do not grab it here but a lit more a little bit more to the uh to the end
sensors
um
well it it's on the um eraser now so we click the pen button
okay so not too fast writing
um
you can insert a new um slide or or white board uh uh file um by either using the insert function or by clicking the next button or the blank button
it's quite the same
um all our um whi um uh smartboard um notes should be kept in the same file
so do not m make a new file
just use this one uh during the day
um you can use the eraser to
make something go away
but we all use the same white board file
yes
so we can work together on it while we're or should we only use it in the in the meetings
yeah
yeah in the meetings only in the meetings
yeah okay
it's really like like a regu regular whiteboard
yeah alright
yep
um you can choose the format um sorry
uh
let me see
um
well
i guess it's maybe because i'm not s uh pen selected
yep
current colour you can choose another colour
and um for example
black and you c i can choose the line width
um so now i d have a different
line width and uh colour
okay
quite easy if you uh do have any questions just c ask me
um to um oh well i'm i wrote down the documents uh should be in the project documents folder if you want to uh discuss it with us
um as a little training um i will ask ruud first to draw uh uh your own animal on a new slide uh with uh a different colour and a different line width than the one uh now selected
okay
um green
an animal
okay
um
uh a wee rabbit
it's a bunny
a rabbit
alright
okay well great
um roo could you do the same please
but of course flores
but a different animal with a different colour and a different line width
blank
sebastian is thinking about the animal
i'm just uh guessing what should be my favourite animal
okay
yeah i'm think about it too
format
well it looked more than a bunny than a cat but it works right
well i'll give it a try
yeah
it it should be a cat
okay
mm
i'm guessing a horse
very good
with a very small legs
i was very good in drawing
you should feed that uh that animal
well i guess you uh get the idea
yes okay
beautiful
beautiful
okay so um you can use this at any time during the presentation if you want to
um any questions well just just let me know
um okay back to our project
um the remote control we are going to develop um will have a selling price of about twenty five euros
uh the profit we are looking for for this product is fifty million euros
which is quite a number
um we uh we will focus this internationally so the product will be sold um
if there is market uh interest uh in in more than one country
and um the production costs should not be more than uh twelve euro fifty
so we should keep that in mind by uh w w during the development um because uh well those are important numbers
um then the discussion maybe the time for sebastian to show his presentation
yes um i have some technical uh issues which i would like to present to you uh before we start the discussion
because uh there might be some uh influations influences
limitations
okay
okay
okay
okay great
okay
um first about my role role of the industrial designer
i would like to think about uh the implementation of uh of things and the technical possibilities and impossibilities
so if someone of you comes up with uh ideas uh i'll try to translate them in technical functions but uh there might be some impossibilities
so that's one
uh i also will propose some uh um
uh some implementations for that but well these are quite the same
sorry about that
um and i also will remind people of some new technical possibilities which are available and which might be interesting to implement in our product
okay
i have some uh initial ideas about some things um which are maybe nice to take with you in the upcoming uh discussion
one thing about uh interopera operability
um i think a modern uh remote control should uh control a device diverse subset of equipment
uh for instance uh d. v. d. players cell phones video and audio equipment
so one re uh one remote control for all your equipment
and for a cell phone
well there should be some interoperabi interoperability between them
yeah okay
yeah
i think it could come in handy
we should discuss that
um and we should think about the way how these things uh should communicate with each other
we're not uh living in the uh nineteen eighties anymore so infrared is not uh
is not really uh hot uh technical stuff anymore
but you should uh think about the things like uh bluetooth
but
yeah but the infrared it's uh well a little bit old fashioned if you would call it like that
mm-hmm
but it's cost effective
but all the t. v. s are uh equipped with infrared so
yes
mm-hmm
y you you can
well not all not all
so that's the point
most of them
so
or you shou sh use a you should equip infrared and bluetooth together in one remote
maybe but that's uh something we should discuss and uh about every everybody should think about it
yeah
so that's just my role i'll just uh give you uh everybody some technical input
and i think now the time is to have a little discussion about what uh the product should be and how it should look
yeah
but take these things into account when you start the discussion
okay so the the main por uh the main points you are uh telling us are focus on the inter uh operability and
yes so one thing uh one remote control should uh control one or more uh pieces of equipment and the way of communicating with these equipments
okay and and uh
okay
okay good
okay
um that was your presentation
that's it
okay okay
um okay
great
um
i'll go back to my own presentation
um
mm
okay
um i i do think it's time now to to discuss uh mm some things
um sebastian told us a few things about the technical implemen uh implications
um there are other things like um how to make it trendy which is i think uh um most uh ru uh ruud's uh role
um the way how it should be controlled by the user which is uh roo uh r uh during this part
mm-hmm
um so let's start with you
h how do you think the remote should um function for the user
well i had a few uh things in mind
um well the interoperability just like uh sebastian said um the remote should work on different t. v. s or even different uh um
yeah uh what is it devices
yep
um so i i i think it's a universal remote control for customers to buy just new in uh a store
yes i think it should be something like that
it's not for uh for uh for uh philips or whatever to buy our remote for their own product right
okay so we're we're going business to consumer not we're we're it's not a
yeah i do i don't know that
it's no i have uh don't have the information for it
we're not developing this product for a specific vendor are we
no
no we're just developing this product and we want to sell it to a very broad uh public so it should fit to every device
no
no okay
yeah
yeah
uh ruud y do you agree
yeah i think i think they're right yeah
okay
okay
um
well the techni fu technical function uh what you said is just by pressing the button you should change the state of the t. v.
that's just the basic f technical function
yeah
so that was my really my part for uh this session
um
so is that ease of use or uh is that more like um
yeah
well that's just the fu the technical function is pure what should the remote control do
wh what is his task uh as an uh as an uh device
mm-hmm
it just should change the t. v. 's state
okay
so that's it
um but furthermore
and you you see uh the buttons as a as a means of doing this
yeah
or are there any o other controls
yeah with buttons
are there only any other cont
yeah or maybe you want a touch screen or
well i i've seen these remote controls with uh this little stick uh which you can move forward sidewords
but
yeah
uh-huh
you know these things
and um it's very easy for a user to to switch w yes
they're very vu vulnerable
yeah
to to switch b uh between uh channels or uh change uh between tracks on a on a c. d.
on on a chapters you know on a d. v. d. player
so maybe that's an idea i don't know
yeah
and for other user interface i had um well it's more industrial thing
uh point at a t. v. i think it's it's quite disturbing when you always have to point directly to the t. v.
mm-hmm
so you must point everywhere so maybe infrared is
okay
maybe not even pointed
yeah just don't even point it so in that case infrared should uh maybe uh be restriction to that
yeah
mm-hmm
okay uh
uh is that uh are there restriction for the range the operating range too
so when you're not able to point at the device um the range is very limited
yeah if you g if you go to radio or or yeah
for t. v. you're always in in the neighbourhood of a t. v. so i don't think think
the range should be a problem to that but if you want to uh get it working with a radio
mm-hmm
mm-hmm
and you're in outside your garden with just one uh speaker then maybe the range should be uh
mm-hmm
okay
okay gentlemen um uh just a reminder we d we have five minutes left for this meeting um okay
but
okay
yeah
two more things
um
you should able to feel the buttons without uh it mis um you have to know what you do without looking at the buttons
so it should be as user interface um for feeling should be uh good to understand
you must feel the buttons for volume or whatever i think
okay s yeah
yeah
and of course you don't always know where all buttons are so it should be visible al um in dark too
so when it's dark
okay
those are two really uh user interface
uh i'll write down glow in the dark
yeah
that's perfect
is tha okay
okay
okay um uh i just want to hear uh ruud's um input for this meeting
do do you
um do you have anything already w um ab idea about how the market uh will respond to the such a product
or what we should take um in account when developing such a product
uh i think most most things have already been said like uh control multiple devices
mm-hmm
and uh yeah infrared might be an issue
because
uh well he said about n abo what he said about pointing
mm-hmm
but uh lots of devices already use infrared
so
we'll probably have to implement that
okay
okay
okay sebastian did you have any other ideas
um well yes i had uh about three minutes ago but i've seem to forget them forgot them
um oh yes i remember
um you said something about visibility in the dark
um
yeah
uh would it be nice for a user to have display on this uh remote control on which you can see functions
which makes it easier to operate it
yeah
well maybe i um but it it can be quite simple you can just have white buttons with a black mark on it
i i don't know
mm-hmm
okay
the uh the the digits in black
mm-hmm
uh then it's already visible in dark
okay
so it it don't have to be a lightning or or a fancy well it can be for design of course
okay
okay
yeah yeah okay because because we wa we want to develop a trendy product
yes but there's a cost limitation too
so
well that's more
yeah twelve euro fifty yeah
yeah
so that's a big problem i think
i think the the financial part of this project uh implicates that it's not going to be a high high end product
the cost price is very low
okay
um
just remind something
the digits of uh the the painting on the buttons should not fade
okay okay
okay
you have a m uh
very good point
yeah
always have s the soft buttons always uh
clear the the the paint on it
the marks
okay
okay um i ha i have one point f um which which comes in mind now
um uh d i think the device should either be rechargeable very easily um or it should not consume too much um power
mm-hmm
okay
because it's very annoying if you need to change the batteries every s uh uh every other week
yeah
okay
so um
maybe we could um for example uh only light the buttons that are um uh applicable at that moment or yeah
but um
necessary yeah
i dunno it's uh that's more sebastian's uh um
yeah
hmm
but then bluetooth uh might be problem
'cause i think bluetooth uh
it's use uh a lot of uh well well cell phones have uh integrated bluetooth also and well it's it seems to work uh quite okay
yeah i know it from the cell phone
well does it
i'm not sure
uh
yeah
so uh technically it will be possible
but you can't you can't use bluetooth all the time twenty four hours a day
no you cannot
okay
does it
gentlemen i'm afraid we do not have any more time
it's over
okay
um
okay
so we will go back to our own uh work
um next meeting starts in thirty minutes and um well you know your o your individual actions or your personal coach will probably email you about th it
um so
this was it
okay
see you in thirty minutes
great
welcome back
hello
hello
uh let me see
there's one of mine
okay
roo welcome back
hello flores
the waiting is for sebastian
there he is
is there any time for a cup of coffee
we have a slight problem
i opened uh the c. d. rom box uh guys
sorry
can i get a cup of coffee
uh no
okay
you can't sorry
so just cancel it
well during my work i have no time either
so
well this is life
sorry uh roo
yeah i opened the c. d. rom box
okay
accidentally
okay
but it's alright
people welcome back with the second meeting
um for now on the schedule are a few points
uh first of all the opening which we are doing now
um second i received um some new project requirements
i'm not sure if you received them as well um but i will tell you about it
mm-hmm
um then um the three of you uh prepared a presentation i think
sebastian
i think so too
roo
yeah
ruud
almost
almost okay
then we'll do your one uh uh as la uh the last
um the top goal of this m
but you can't upload your presentation from here i believe
um we will figure that out
okay
ca can you try to
uh if it if it if it's wireless i could just uh put it in the
yeah w we will see
i don't think it's wireless here
um it is yeah
it is
or it is
it is
yeah
okay great
uh okay
yeah
um the top goal of this meeting is to reach a decision on the product
on the target group um and and the functions of the remote control so keep that in mind
um
we have forty minutes
so
it's now
yep
okay
um the new project requirements first of all um we didn't speak about it but we should not um support teletext in the remote
um because our b um board uh feels that uh teletext is out of date and internet is replacing teletext
so um we are not even going to try to um implement it in our product
it's a board decision
um the remote control should only be used for television because it's not uh f uh feasible
it's not uh w uh uh we we cannot make it because of the time to market um that we have to deal with
yeah
time yeah
uh the third requirement is that we should focus on customers that are younger than uh forty
which is important for you uh ruud and as well for uh roo
because the product should um be uh interesting and and uh should be bought by people younger than forty
um
then for roo as well uh important the corporate image should be recognisable in our product
so the colour colours and the slogan um do have to be uh in the product
yes
is that clear
any questions on these
requirements
no
okay
um the individual presentations i th um roo or sebastian who of you would like to start
yeah i'll start
uh uh yeah
yes
okay great
um
oh how can i uh
geez and sli and show
um
just uh press it
uh yes
alright
um well w we uh we had discussed this already in the fin in the previous uh discussion
uh the method of the remote control is just the function of remote control is basically to send messages to the television set
so that was
the main uh important thing what a remote control should do
yeah
then i found uh two different kind of remote controls the multi function uh remote control with many possibilities
but um the lack of the feeling i already mentioned uh in the previous uh discussion
mm-hmm
and the ease of use remote control with uh the less p possibilities but a great feeling in in touching the buttons
yeah
um but um yeah
my personal preferences were ease of uh the easy to use remote control because uh the user friendliness and uh it can be more trendy in in user design
but um your new goal f was for uh people than less than forty years old
uh-huh
so maybe um the multi function can be implemented in uh in our design
but it should b i think it should be a combination but teletext buttons are not uh in our design
so it should uh
take out well eight buttons or so
but my in my opinion the the easy to use r. c. is uh the best uh possi possibility for us
okay
uh ruud did you get that
yeah uh b uh most
yeah
okay so the important thing here is
and it's also i indeed uh uh ruud's uh insight in the in the topic
oh user friendly
in the market yeah
yeah what what does the market want
i i don't know
yeah okay w we will s we all uh
just for uh for user desi uh user uh friendliness i uh should choose for the the ease of use remote control
yeah
okay
sebastian
okay
excuse me
scusi
um
okay it's still the right thing
okay
um well there are some changes in the design requirements so there are some changes in the method also
um basically all this device has to do is send messages to a t. v. set
and the m most easy way to do this is by uh sending pulses of infrared light to a t. v. set
well i th i tried to uh implement a picture here but it's hardly readable
energies and uh
can you see it
no it's not visible
no
well
um there's a energy source here
and um basically there it's connected to three things
the user interface connected to a chip which is connected to the sender which generates messages using uh infrared light which are sent to the receiver
that's basically the idea
and there's a little picture just for your imagination how a device like this should look or can look
okay
um what have i found
usually these kind of things consist of a battery infrared diode buttons chips and circuit board
that's all
it's cased together nothing more than that
it's almost every piece of equipment um
every piece of uh every t. v. set is controlled infrared
yeah
there are some exceptions but most of all have uh infrared controls
and uh the more luxury uh remote controls have lithium buttons
and i think that's what we w yes
the glow in the dark uh concept uh we discussed
in the and it's a little more a little bit more fancy also
so maybe we should consider that
yeah
okay
okay
i have a basic scheme of the things uh which are implemented
um basically this is all there is
there's just one chip
there are a few buttons connected
uh the buttons are lit
and the whole thing is transmitted by a infrared li diode and there is not a power source here
so that's basically the total design of this piece of equipment
there's nothing more to it
so it's fairly easy
it's fairly easy
it's been done many times before and i think we should uh we should c s succeed in in our plan to do this
succeed in it also
okay
okay good
so
okay so uh personally i think we should infra use infrared because uh otherwise our device cannot uh communicate with uh almost every t. v. set
so i think that uh should be clear
okay
uh another important point is uh we really should use uh energy uh sparse friendly components
uh there are specially uh designed um energy friendly components which consume uh far less power than uh conventional components
and um if we want to use uh a rechargeable design or uh a energy save design we should really implement them
um for cost effectiveness we should really use a very low cost uh circuit board
um because most of the production cost are are in this uh part of the equipment
okay
and um the money we save on using this we can use uh for elaborate fancy lighting uh techniques blinking leds and all that kind of fancy stuff
i think our uh users will really uh will really like that
and what's the um if we use the leds i does it use much more energy or
no they're p f uh power friendly leds also
okay
so we can use them
so that's no problem
for the same costs it's can be uh in our
uh no they're uh they're a little bit more expensive but by uh um um making
combined with the low cost circuit board so it's uh
we can we can make its i think
well you could only lit uh the buttons the buttons that are used most
so the channel switching
yeah
yeah
or
yeah
but but the question is whether um two or four buttons makes uh m makes such a difference in the costs if you already plan to uh include fancy lightning techniques
okay
but i think
hmm
i guess
hmm true
yeah i think it's the same as in the cell phone just light in in the device that that shines on all the buttons and not for
yes
well it's not one light it there are more lights in a in a in a mobile device
yeah but not for each button one led i think
no no no no
that's right that's right
okay
so well this uh should be it
okay
um have a think about it
yeah
okay ruud
oh mine is already outdated
okay well we ar we are very curio curious to what the market um will feel about such a product
since uh
so any income is welcome
input
okay make
well
uh then i'm sure the target market is uh ten million units
of of which we should sell about uh forty percent to make the five million
could you step a little bit more to the right
okay
yeah thank you
but um since uh the other part is uh forty percent of the market i uh thought earlier we might want to constrain that portion of the market
but uh since uh the requirements changed that's uh not a good idea
uh well skip this
yeah
well it's this till true of course
that they only use ten percent the buttons
the buttons to zap are used the about uh fifteen hundred times when uh the power button is only used one time
and the volume button's only four times
so they're obv obviously uh the most important buttons
and uh lots of people complained they kin can't find their remote control
mm
so we might want to build in a feature to uh support them
some uh audio signal
like uh home phones
okay
or
well that's interesting
or a find a finding function you know
yeah
yeah that's definitely interesting
that's quite a yes
it uh it separates our product from others uh as well
sound signal
yeah
yeah
okay go on
yes
well i just said that
and uh well this obvious and he also said it
okay
so that's what the market tells us
uh that's about it yes
yep
okay
the volume and uh the zap buttons are the mostly used
uh mo uh zap buttons most
so
volume they are uh use a lot
but
yeah well it should just have a design
more than all the other buttons
so
the perfect design for those only those buttons
yes
and first um
yes we should focus on that i guess
yeah
yep
well the technical uh there i think there are no technical difficulties
there's no um elaborate technique uh used in this uh kind of equipment
so um i don't think we have any hiccups there
so we can fully concentrate on developing a product that is really um what the market needs
so maybe it's a good idea to think about these buttons and and uh and a sound signal
yeah the sound signal
just one thing i'm just wondering the sound signal from where do you execute th the s sound
yeah that's uh a problem
well
yes
th that's a bit of that's a problem
another device is not a solution
yeah
well maybe maybe like clapping in your hands like um turning on and off the the the lights
usually
it should be uh uh
oh yes
yeah but maybe you'll uh get some new technologies for it
yes
well there there are some devices who uh incorporate this technique already
um there are video sets and um they have a special button the find the remote control button
you press it and your t. v. set starts to make a uh kind of weird sound and your uh remote controls then start to beep
reports rep respend response to it
and um
yeah just like uh the phones the
yes
yes that's it
yes same thing
yeah
but uh th
but but t. v. s don't have all uh
no so we we should use something else
uh buttons
and you
uh
yeah and usually
yeah because we do not have a a a a a home um
but i believe you will have an
we do not control the t. v. set so well
and even if the t. v. set would have such a button uh you would have to walk to your t. v. and it's
yes m yes
s and we b we want to make so it's is easy as possible for our customers so we should think about
okay
so what about the clapping technique
um because you se
i'm convinced uh sebastian will uh find uh one solution for us
it's quite complicated
well it's quite complicated
because how can you separate the clapping sound from other sounds
and b
well you see it a lot in in light uh lightning uh uh
yes yes
well basically the characteristics uh the characteristics of clapping is just an increase in the volume
yeah a peak
the amplitude of the sound which is uh generated a few times within a uh certain period of time
yeah
yeah
but there are many other sounds uh which are exactly the same from the point of view from a remote control
so if if you'd be watching a movie it would constantly beep
yeah that's true
yes so we don't want that
but we can have just uh uh a home stat uh f a base station next to the t. v.
maybe we can
just a little antenna or uh something
something like that
well if you lost th i don't think people would bother walking to the t. v. and press that button because they lost the their remote
well is there not something f something more easily
well uh
well i don't think uh
uh that's just uh
no
and y the the most important thing for people is that there's a central point to which they can go and uh b uh perform a a some kind of uh
yeah
and then uh the remote control uh reports itself so w we should use have uh we should use something like that
you do not want another device which can be uh everywhere in the house which you have to find first before you can find your remote control
just a base station next to the t. v. is the best possibility
yes something like that
but that will be very costly i think
so that's not a good idea
yeah m maybe um w we uh we do agree on on the thing that the remote should have such a function
yeah
if it's possible within the costs and all that kind of things
mm-hmm
um maybe sebastian should have uh a detailed look later on and um come up with a solution because that's his his field of expertise
i will
yeah
yes
yes
but um before i do that i w i want to warn you that uh by implementing this kind of a function the technical design will become more complicated um and it will become more costly also
mm-hmm
yep
because there will be additional components which which uh will be used
and there are some implepe imp
and do we even uh prefer the sound above the the leds the lightning uh
well i i think so because um when you have a p newspaper over your remote control you cannot see it
function
it's a unique item uh
so
yeah it's a distinction in the market
it will be an a unique feature of our remote control
it's a different exactly
yeah
it's an uni an unique feature and um i think um it's worth um uh looking and and probably more i interesting than uh than the lights
yeah
and just about uh the user interface i came up with um an easy remote control and an advanced remote control
yeah
what should we choose in in design
yeah
well um according to ruud um people do not use um all the extra features very very often
well the extra functions
so
i have the numbers r i have the numbers right here
okay
well t uh we won't support teletext which which was the third most the second most used function
used option
okay
okay
well we we do have a wise board so i'm not questioning that
uh well yeah channel selection is obviously the most important
yeah
okay so on the relevance scale uh the channel selection the volume selection and the teletext
so
yeah
well we skip that
yeah
so
well so it just th the basic functions
okay
and we don't have to use it for d. v. d. players uh and all kind of stuff
no no
no
so
nope
so that's out of the question
yeah
yeah
so
just through uh the easy uh design
uh uh uh i think we should go for the easier one
we can make uh a nice design when when there's not mu uh much buttons in it
i think also
yes
so
well
we should save costs uh by not implementing a lot of functions and uh the money that we can save from that we should use for uh having a nice design and uh thinking about the user interface and
no
yeah
okay ruud how do you feel about that
uh do you agree do you think the market would would respond to uh a simple
uh well if we um include other uh innovative
functions uh then they uh might 'cause young people uh like new features
mm-hmm
mm yeah
so
yeah that's right
okay so this is is kind of uh
mm
uh just a few buttons trendy design nice lightning effects wh and the sound
okay
well is it maybe there's another possibility
you can make it look like an easy s piece of equipment but it's quite elaborated uh because it has many functions
yeah
maybe it's more important to make the make it look like a very uh friendly easy to catch piece of equipment but um nevertheless
but but are we not in in the in the manual uh i mean if you have few buttons no display
mm-hmm
mm-hmm
um i mean uh i guess it's l it's working with with a shift functions and um one button can uh
ok like that
well i was more thinking about a more elaborate way of controlling by by these kinds of sticks or something like that
i don't know if if it's user friendly
that's your field of expertise
yeah i don't know yet
but but how does how does the remote uh report uh r uh give back to the user w in what state it is
because we do not implement uh a user history
mm-hmm
there's no but there's no way to do that because we cannot implement that kind of the system
i know but but if we use uh like a stick for example um
w
mm-hmm
well maybe we can use a light for that
when you move the stick to a to a position maybe uh a light next to it can lit up
so you know i've just uh pushed the button or i changed the channel or t uh turned up the volume
something like that
and if you use that stick for volume control and channel uh selection you have the m two most important functions in one uh button
yeah
yes
uh and we could have other buttons for the for the advanced uh functions
but does it uh i then should n just use uh i instead of the stick
uh like many cell phones just a round m well should we just use a
yeah draw draw it on the board
um it's already uh oh we have a blank
oh
oh yeah something like that
it's not really a stick but
it's just an easy uh way of of a round button what which can be pushed in four directions
yes
yes
instead of a stick
a stick is v vulnerab vulnerable
hmm
yeah it can break down
when it's falling down or uh just a round uh button should be the trick i think
yes yes
yeah
and
yes and this also looks more fancy i think
i think it it will attract uh
yeah
more uh uh public i think
a younger uh-huh
but you're the marketing man
and it's also quite easy to use so it'll it uh attract younger people because well new and it might attract older people because it's easy to use
geez
well volume and
something uh
like that
uh-huh
the programme up and down
okay yeah
and the vol yeah the pen doesn't uh really does what i want
okay that's good
okay but w we still we're still in the question of uh um uh putting in advanced options
um ruud just told us um the market is interested in some advanced uh new techniques
um however uh keeping it simple is is important for the costs and all all those kind of things
we need to find a balance between uh the advanced techniques and and the user friendliness
mm-hmm
but i think our our next step to look at is just that
so i don't think it's um we have something to do
uh we can't discuss it right now because n no one of us have has the information to discuss about that
um well for we do have to uh decide this this meeting
i think
yes
yeah
we need to um have the uh the user function uh the functions decided and um
mm-hmm
okay
uh our target audience
'kay but teletext is so uh is just scrapped
okay
do do you want a list of functions
do you want an explicit list
uh which uh incorporates all function available on the device
um well i do not want a full uh it's not necessary to to have a full list but i want um the kind of functions
for example uh th the most important are volume and uh programme selecting
okay
okay
mm-hmm
the ten digits
well for example that that's what we should think about
l how is the remote going to look
oh and just one function
not not in the user interface but
the the the the programme to programme button the switch to uh two channels
mm-hmm
when you have uh something on channel four and something on channel six just one button which which can uh change yeah
yes
yeah
a bit of a split mode
change
uh l like yeah
yes yes
dual channel watch
yes
yeah
okay well um m maybe i should write that down
well you're the secretary
uh ruud um what's your last name
mielsen
mielsen because i i was writing it down in the last uh mielsen
right
um i put all the minutes i make into the shared folder
so if you want to have a look at it you know where to find it
mm okay but make a s make a sub folder for it because it's starting to fill up already
alright
um
yeah that's that's if you want to do it sebastian
yeah
sure
our b. s. c. uh w. uh
okay um
okay so so um uh
volume
programme
uh dual channel
uh
yes that's important
and and do we want um
the ten digits
the ten digits
yeah i believe so
well are are you sure
well if you want to go to channel ninety and you have th that button
i'm not so sure
yeah
well that's complicated but is that so relevant
yeah
because i don't think but you should uh shou you should know that
i wouldn't buy it personally
if it were so
a remote control without the ten digits
okay i can imagine when
uh and i think the most
i agree actually
i can imagine when you're when you have a satellite decoder and and you have well about six hundred channels i can imagine you want this
just elder elder people would would buy it but
well
but if you're uh a regular t. v. user and you just want uh to watch the the dutch television networks
well you can uh you can use uh about ten buttons
but we do have thirteen different dutch channels
that's enough
but
yep
yeah and if if we
the older people only use five of them
well but how how often do you watch all these channels
and if we are targeting at the younger audience they will probably watch more channels than the older people
often
so
no you're probably right
yeah
okay
but i think these uh ten uh buttons look a bit dull
don't you think
well it depends on the on the on the looks on the on the
the design
on the design
okay
well y then there should be should done be done something specific with it
well
you c you can d make them very fancy by um
and
i mean nokia they have ten digits on their phones and it still looks very fancy
mm-hmm
yeah
so i'm i'm i do not agree
uh
okay so you can experiment by uh with with shape or with size or with colour that kind of thing
exactly exactly
okay
and um there are some numbers about uh speech recognition here that uh younger people would like it
uh it might be expensive and uh hard to implement but it would be a solution uh
okay speech
for
well maybe it can be combined with the find the remote control
yeah
so um when you add uh speech recognition to your remote control uh it's very easy to change uh the channel
yeah
that's one thing
and it's very easy uh to find your remote control
to find yeah
so maybe that's a possibility but i'm afraid it will be a bit costly
yeah
but maybe when we uh
uh
if if we would um drop the ten digits but keep the programme and the volume because maybe people do not always want to use their voice um
mm-hmm
okay
okay okay
especially elder people uh don't like voice recognition
so then we should implement such a but
yeah
but we do focus on younger people
we d it it's a board uh decision
okay
yes
well
i i think it should uh should work it sh we should manage that
so we have to i to make um a decision between the ten digits or the voice recognition
okay
yes
well the voice recognition has the main adva has another advantage
it's mas it makes it very easy for us to implement the find uh find the remote control button uh remote control function
mm-hmm
so that's that's a big advantage i think
okay
okay g good
okay
there's only one disadvantage uh by implementing this
um the power saving power saving will be a bit more difficult
so we can expect that there will be a less longer life to the batteries
but maybe can we we can think something smart about it
mm
yep
there are some uh hybrid hybrid devices which incorporate a solar panel and rechargeable batteries
okay
so when you just leave the device in a in a light room it charges itself
but
you have to do nothing for it
but but can we manage it bu uh for the costs
m
twelve dollar fifty
maybe maybe not
because it seems like a very
and uh if we if we could inc uh include a c a cradle in which it could recharge
i'll have to find that out
yes
then there wouldn't be uh a big problem
so
no that's very cheap
'cause when
is a cradle very cheap
it's oh it's very cheap
that's no problem
it's just a a case with two uh metal contacts
i know b uh but there should be an adapter as well
it's
yes but they're they're mass production
yeah
they're very cheap
so it will cost us p practically nothing
okay
okay
we we have uh about ten minutes left this meeting
um
i would like to hear um maybe maybe you all have th uh things not um spoken about yeah but that are important
uh ruud you you came up with the voice recognition uh data
uh are there other things about the market we should know
um i think we dealt with the most important information
just that the younger part of uh the market isn't the forty percent we uh
want to sell to
so we we should uh for least a bit uh look at the uh older people
but with uh buttons like that which are easy to use we uh might attract them too
okay
so
okay
i don't think that's a big problem
yeah
okay so although we are focussing on younger people uh to make it uh profitable uh
yes
profitable
yeah profitable
profitable
we we yeah we still need to take in account the the bit older people
yes
okay
o okay
um roo
i have nothing uh nothing to add i think
nothing to add
sebastian
um i just want to make a summary of all all things uh spoken and uh the different possibilities
yeah
great
um
so uh basically we've decided to implement a seemingly uh easy design
so on the outside it looks easy but uh we can make it easy on the inside or elaborate on the inside
so that's one the those are the choices we have to make
but i think there's a big advantage in making it more elaborate by uh implementing uh speech techniques uh voice recognition that these kinds of things
mm-hmm
yeah
um it makes it also more uh attractable i think to our uh audience
um there are some advantages and some disadvantages and the main advantage is that we can implement uh fancy techniques which uh i think our customers will like
the disadvantage is that there are some concerns about uh the the costs and um the things like uh battery lifetime energy saving
yep
uh another advantage is that the circuit board will become much more easier if we do not do not implement these buttons
if we just add uh uh a chip which does the voice recognition uh our circuit board will become even more cheap
so that's another well it wa it w it was an issue but we also thought that we already thought we should do it as cheaply as possible
yeah and that was the main issue right
the the board
yeah
and this even uh makes it more cheapy
so
but the cheaper the ch uh the the chip or th what was it
mm-hmm
the board
the circuit board
the circuit board
the fewer buttons you can use on it
the fewer buttons you have the ch ch the cheaper the circuit board yes
no it's th yeah
yeah okay
it's the other way around yeah
yeah
and it's very cheap uh to incorporate uh uh an integrated circuit a chip
so that's
that's another advantage
it shouldn't be a big issue
well it then we should just uh take a look at the costs and uh especially for the voice recognition
so
yes because i don't know
yes
i d i really don't know
so
no
it can be costly
okay
maybe not
i'm not sure how how we'll f uh determine the costs i will have a look at it
maybe you will get some information on that
yes
um i'm not sure how how that
yes i al i i hope my personal coach will uh have a lo uh look at it
yep
okay great
um
well i think we're qui quite done
we're done i think
um for now we will have the lunch break
how nice
um i'm don't know how long the break will be but we'll find out
me neither
um then we will have thirty minutes of time to perform our individual work uh and i'm sure your personal coaches will uh assist you with it
um i will put the minutes i just made in the project documents folder
if you want to look at it um well just do
um the interface designer um i would like to the next meeting i would like to receive the uh components concept
uh roo um from you i would like to see
interface industrial
uh
i'm sorry yeah i'm sorry
yeah
user interface designer uh roo i would like to see the user interface c uh concept
well we understand
and um
uh the only problem is it that it depends on the divisions the decis uh decisions sebastian makes
well
about the voice recognition
well i it should be easy that's w w what we concluded
well
it should be an easy interface with not so much buttons
mm yes
yeah
s just a a p a p a volume and a programme one
and um
um yeah some some fancy lights
i think that's what we decided
so we drop the voice recognition
or oh
no no no we didn't but it shouldn't be integrated yeah it's of course it's user interface
but um i i was talking about really the design of the
okay
well um do we really have to decide now or can we decide next meeting
no
we can decide the next meeting
okay
yep
because i'll have some updated info on that uh
yeah
i guess all of you have i updated info
i'm sure the marketing expert will receive uh t uh you will do some trend watching
yep
and i'm sure the market will um uh
hmm
uh will change adapt and um so we will see that
adapt
adapt
left
hmm
um yeah that's it for now
that's it
'kay
any other questions or can we have the lunch
we can have the lunch
yeah
yeah okay
i'll take the lunch
good
do you need to change anything on it
um
because otherwise i will already open it
mm don't think so
okay
unless uh things have suddenly change again
is it much changes
uh don't know
maybe uh you've got new information like uh last time
uh i didn't no no
i do hot have
only the same information
okay
hello sebastian
hello hello mister p. m.
i believe uh miss uh tentel is with us as well in the control room
well that's where the thinking goes on
oh it's that roo again always late
bongiorno
bongiorno
i think you should punish him
you're the p. m.
hmm
punish
i see some interesting okay
possibilities yeah
you wish
people welcome back
welcome
the third meeting
uh
oop
um i have some points i would like to uh some some issues i would like to point out
um first of all um if you make minutes yourself as well uh like sebastian does um could you put them on the shared folder
if you do not make minutes no problem but it's easy for me to see what you uh wrote down
yeah
so i could uh can uh um use that in the in the report
um the second thing um
i was th uh s thinking to myself i have this little remote control
and i'm talking to it but i still need to point to the television because it works with infrared
that's quite strange
yes
okay
so
we'll come to that later i g i think
um the agenda for now uh uh are there any pre discussion questions
no
not at all
no
okay
um we wi we will have your individual presentations uh then the decision on the remote control concept um and uh the closing
forty minutes in total for this
so um i think we we can immedis immediately start with the individual presentations um the progress you've made
okay
um i think it might be smart to look at uh ruud's um information first because i understood there are some uh significant changes in the market situation
'kay
hmm
alright
oh
just press the okay button it works
yeah
okay
um yeah
yeah
yeah
my method
how surprising
well findings
uh
ease of use is important but uh innovation is more important and a fancy look and feel is uh even more important
and uh some fashion watchers have found out that the young target group likes fruit and vegetables
in their uh clothes shoes and furniture and that they want spongy material
probably watch too much sponge bob
uh the older group uh still prefers dark colours
simple shapes uh m material
but we since we are concentrating on uh
the younger group
uh w wait a sec wait a se uh could you go to the previous slide
oh wait uh wait up
um because i'm taking minutes and it
'kay
um were the important themes enclose
yeah okay
the feel of to be spongy
uh so do you think um when fruit and vegetables are important for clothing and shoes that they are in remote controls also
well uh one example given was this so um i assume they just want something colourful
not uh specifically uh an apple as a remote control or something
not something dull
okay
but they like dark colours you said in the p
no uh the younger group likes uh more colourful
okay
uh
objects
well then i suggest that the corporate colours are grey and yellow
but
i had
but can you can you go back to that slide
the uh just one slide back no no no
which one
this
yes
okay and the feel of the material has to be spongy
yes
has it something to do with that uh natural feeling also do you think
uh well it might
but personally i wouldn't like a sponge as a remote control
but
maybe soft material or something
but not a real sponge
okay so so yeah it might not be t uh it it shouldn't be too hard
it it maybe it rubber or or yeah
yeah exactly
okay
yeah and like uh the older group likes familiar materials but that doesn't mean we should use wood
or we could make oh
so
okay
well this this is an example of what they would like
but since we're conten concentrating on uh the younger group
i think we should use soft materials
and uh make it colourful or uh like cell phones exch exchangeable covers
yeah
so we could provide
both for the young and the old what they like
well that's interesting
it's quite interesting
you could make a few v very colourful ones and uh a very traditional co cover
yeah o o
yes
i'm thinking about uh the bananarama telephone uh telephone from uh siemens
the yellow uh rubber telephone
yeah yeah
it's the it's the rubber uh
yeah it is it is i yeah
cover
and it's uh colourful
it looks likes a banana
yeah
we have the fruit we have the colours
do you know the phone
we have the simple design
i don't know the phone but i can imagine it
it's the siemens uh c. twenty five i believe it's it's the one the post bank uh gave away the very
um thirty five
oh that one yes
and the b the light blue and it's also in yellow
now i kn uh oh i know i know
yes i i've seen it
i've seen it
you kn you know ruud as well
about th
i've seen it but
okay
okay
um uh okay
do you have uh thit that was okay
'kay
uh that's about it
okay so the the m uh important findings are uh innovation is more important than ease of use for the our target group
yes
and um colouring is important and and uh soft materials
uh soft material
okay
so so ease of use is important but technology is twice as important
and what was even more important
uh the fancy look and feel
okay
so that's the most important thing for our customers
yes
apparently
okay roo
yeah
could you do your presentation
mm-hmm
well i don't ha really have much to add um because most of things we already said in uh
the previous uh discussion
um
okay well it's good to to sum up uh the things we already thought about
uh the previous ideas were voice recognition and uh the round button for uh the p channel programming and uh volume
well a few interface i uh i found on the internet are are these
these are both with uh with voice recognition but they're very advanced and very high tech and just um well a weird um
shape
shape
so i suggest i couldn't uh i had a small uh mock up uh sign on the on paper
but it didn't work
my pen didn't load um the information
so i made a really simple f uh a shape on uh in um
powerpoint
but we could make uh a round uh an oval uh um remote control
mm-hmm
but it's it's kind of uh it's kind of o organic so that's very good
uh yellow
yeah
yeah
and what i'm thinking about maybe um we should make very light but um uh a grip um i mean this is how you hold a remote control
yes
um it shouldn't be too uh glatt too slippery s because um
slippery
but if you have something like uh the siemens phone it's rubber
you have to grab it
yeah
so it's easy in your hand uh indeed
yeah exactly
yeah
yes
there are there are also remote controls who have uh a little shape underneath where you can put your fingers in
yeah ex for your fingers yeah
so you can get a really good grip on it
yeah
so you you don't have to um attain much pressure to it
it's it's a lot easier
yeah
so m
it grips automatically
yes
yeah okay
but i'll i'll go into that deeper in my presentation
okay good
great
oh and um to add on um ruud's information in this um interface we can have uh high tech with the voice recognition and uh
well the the fancy colours and uh and so on and still have the ease of use because we have an easy interface
and all the other remote controls are high tech in buttons and uh and so on
yeah
way too much i think for our goal yeah
yeah
so if you have the voice recognition you can you can programme like thirty uh um
okay b but i think we'll yeah
thirty c uh controls on it
okay but i'll i'll go into that because there are are some possibilities and some impossibilities
um i had a talk with uh our manufacturing uh division and uh we had a talk about all the different components um who are in this design
uh these are the things we've looked at
and of course i used the web to uh find my information
about the casing we have three different casing possibilities
we have the uncurved or flat case
uh that's the most common uh remote con control form uh we're used to is just a it ju it's just a box
i'm sorry i i don't have any pictures of uh of this thing
we have uh a curved one
it's uh curved in two dimensions
you have to imagine it's a bit like a wave form
so it's uh a little more advanced in its in its shape
okay
uh and we have an even more advanced uh shape which is curved in three dimension
i c i think you can compare it a little bit with the uh big grey image uh you had in your presentation
yeah
the the big remote control something like that
right
but it's quite uh advanced and it's
it's quite daring to to use i think
um for these casings we have uh different types of finishing
we can use plastic which is uh very slippery and maybe not so nice
but you can give it any colour uh which is the same for rubber but it's not slippery
we can use wood and titanium
well um we cannot use the titanium on the double curve cases
and these latex cases there's there's just the plastic ones uh won't allow the use of solar cells as an energy source source
which brings me to the different energy sources
um well we even seem to have uh hand dyn dynamos for uh powering our uh remote controls
you really have to imagine like winding up your uh i d
great
well it would be very new to the market but
it would be very new but it's a kind of a retro uh style i think
yeah
uh well this is quite interesting
uh there's there's also a kinetic energy supply
so um when you're watching t. v. uh or when you're you you have to um make some kind of energy kinetic energy by shaking the remote or throwing it against the wall
like the watch
whatever you wish
it have it it has to move that's the the sense of it
and you can store the energy in the in the thing
i think um if if i can hook on to that um the kinetic thing is very funny
mm-hmm
it's very funny indeed
i mean solar is of course it's nice but it's well your uh your calculator has a solar panel
mm-hmm
indeed
um hand dynamo
but if you're watching a movie how many times uh you take the the remote control and and if uh if you have a watch
well maybe m
you have the kinetic uh idea in a watch also
yeah i know
mm-hmm
you you walk and uh but uh you you're sitting on a couch
yes
yeah
but you know you know from your own watch your watch uses uh a minimal con it consumes a minimal amount of energy
the the shaking of your body which is almost uh every activity makes your uh body shake uh it charges it
but uh the problem here is that it it supplies a a very little amount of kinetic energy
so i think uh you have a problem when you're watching a movie and uh you haven't moved the remote uh i remote control in a in an amount of time
yeah
and you want t to switch uh the channel or something well m it might not work
and wha
so that's something you have to keep in mind
okay
so but maybe maybe there's a possibility com to combine it with m uh traditional batteries
so we can save on the batteries and um when there's enough kinet kinetic energy use the kinetic energy and otherwise use the batteries
yeah
okay because i guess the voice recognition feature u consumes quite a f uh a lot of power
uh yes it does
yeah
i'll come to that later
okay
and we of course have the traditional uh solar power
which is just uh uh uh uh uh a piece of material on the remote control which transfers light energy into electricity
the user interface controls um of course we have the push buttons and uh we also have scroll wheels
and these scroll wheels can also be integrated with buttons
so it's just like a mouse
you can scroll 'em you can also push it
um uh in the indicators we have the l. c. d. displays
which means uh you can watch uh in a display w which channel you have chosen or something like that of the li amount of volume which is uh currently uh and we also have double scroll buttons
mm-hmm
which are just two of these things
so we don't really have the the kind of button we had in mind in our uh uh in our last meeting
the the thing with the the round with the four
mm-hmm
oh we can just make four push buttons in a form of a round
yes
that is possible too
yes
but i th i don't think uh the scroll wheels i had some i had some information about it too
mm-hmm
i don't think there's any possibility for us to use scroll wheels
well
i d i can't see uh any uh scenario where you would use a scroll wheel with a button on it
well mayb uh well m me neither
maybe when you integrate some functions
this will be the remote right
yeah
um with uh maybe a channel selector
what about
integrating a scroll bar on this side
yeah uh that's a possibility but
uh it's do it's done before
because this is how you keep it
yes
but flores
it's quite quite good yes
think about a scenario where y where you would use the scroll button for
volume
well it's it well i what he means is there's an button integrated in the scroll wheel
a volume okay
there's no scenario where you use uh the button in the scroll wheel
you just use the wheel
well what about mute
about mute
well yes
thi i i m i guess uh th this is my volume button
okay
yes
and i can either on this side or this side um
well okay
well that that that's one possibility okay
and click it to muten the device
well okay
and and it makes it different from the traditional uh devices on this market
it's quite goods
so i'm looking for a way to
uh make it a little different than the traditional ones
mm-hmm
yes
so maybe um i guess that that's something you two uh need to think about
yeah
uh ruud wha what do you thing about uh a scroll bar
um
uh scroll wheel
wheel
uh well it's obvious obviously new
so it might attract uh the young customers
hmm
okay
but it's done before uh there are many other devices um like uh telephones and our uh radio pocket radios
we use this
yeah
and
well it's it's been done years ago and i don't see it anywhere now
so maybe it's not no
well all the sony telephones use it for example for volume
nokia has a well okay it's not really a scroll wheel
but on their side th the the volume button is on the side because you gri grab it like this
hmm
yes but it uses two separate buttons
yeah
i know it's not really a scroll wheel
it doesn't use a
no
yeah
well
uh something for uh roo here
for you too yeah
yeah i believe uh if you have uh what we've earlier said um the grip uh places in in the remote control
you have your hand on one place on the remote control so you have to place all the buttons in a range of your thumb
wi within reach
yes you have to
so in that case uh the volume button on the side uh of the remote control would be perfect
yes
yes
yeah yeah
okay
okay
sebastian
um
okay um we have to know if you want to use uh these rubber double curved c uh case um you must use these push uh push buttons
there's no way you can integrate l. c. d. displays
there's no way you can integrate scroll wheels because it's all curved
there's there are no uh flat areas where you can incorporate these things
yeah
so that's a limitation
about um the components uh just the hardware
we basically have uh three types of chips we can use and uh these chips incorporate all the logica and um um uh hardware that is needed to send uh to send a signal
uh we have a simple regular and advanced chip
and there is something like a sample sensor and sample speaker which is a little cryptic uh to me
but i think that's the the voice recognition thing that we are uh thinking about
yeah yeah you can um i have some information about it
uh in the voice recognition you say a word you can programme words like uh v uh volume up
mm-hmm
okay
okay
so so okay
of mute let's say mute
um you programme it
you m mute and you g you give um an uh an action to it that that's really the mute function and uh when you speak in the the remote control
mm-hmm
yeah
it repeats uh your saying
so that's the sample sensor
okay
so if you say mute it says mute again and then it's um well i believe it's uh
mm-hmm
it performs the action
yeah and then uh he he repeats its action what which he believes it is
yeah
okay
so you say mute he repeats mute and you makes a computer sound mute and then goes to the mute function
yeah
okay
okay so that's basically the the voice recognition item we were searching for
okay
this sample sensor uh requires an regular chip i thought
um no op i'm not very sure
no it's not in here
if we want to use the l. c. d. display we really need the advanced version which is a bit l little bit more costly
if we want to use the scroll wheels we need the regular version
and if we don't want to use uh any of these uh more advanced functions we can keep with the simple uh chip which is a bit cheaper
okay
uh well uh d did we already decide on the display
okay
to
um no but i think that's something for uh roo here
yeah
to think about
well i don't have um i haven't looked for uh for information about it
but i don't think information uh y i don't think you need it on a display
no
especially when when we have to look at a cost
i i don't think either
i don't think uh 'cause uh uh all any t. v. can uh can uh view a digit on uh on screen yeah
no
i don't think you need it
on screen display
yeah
okay
okay th
okay well my conclusion um unfortunately the market has decided the a little uh other than i thought
i thought um the market would like uh a sort m sort of titanium casing but they seem to like natural uh stuff
so maybe we should think about uh wood finish
um i've chosen the more battery with solar cell uh solution for the energy
it's more reliable it's cheaper
okay
so i don't think we should use the dynamo thing
good
kineti okay
the kinetic thing it it's it's a possibility
hmm
it's it's more advanced but i'm i think you should combine it with batteries
okay it's maybe a bit too too flashy too yeah
otherwise it will not too advanced uh well
it's in in in some way it can give us an advance because you will save on your batteries
but
yeah but that that's the same with the solar cell
yes
that's no different
and i think it's more robust
it's more uh
yeah
okay
but what about um the markets
uh it's more functional
uh wants colourfuls
uh designs
so if you use titanium
no no but the uh um that's what sebastian said
the titanium thing uh
he said uh this is what uh this is my personal preference
we have to skip it
okay
but but yet i understood that the market is different
oh sorry
yeah
so um
so i think we should skip the titanium uh stuff and we should uh use wood or something like that
yeah
and yeah the yeah the older people liked wood
and i would think
no r rubber with colours
oh okay sorry
so it it needs to be rubber
no the
colourful and
yeah the younger people liked soft material
okay
okay spongy materials
yeah
yeah
okay um well um these scroll wheels i think uh they they can be they can be handy
so
and they can be implemented with a regular chip
yes they can
but they really need the regular chip you cannot use the sa simple
okay but we also uh we already need the regular chip for the sample uh sensor speaker oh evalu
well i'm not very sure
maybe that's an uh a different
but but do we want the curved uh uh design or
i think so if you if you stick with the the simple uh straight forward uh not curve design i uh it's too dull
i it's too dull
yeah
yeah
i don't think c our customers will like it
and um if you uh take the double curved uh then you cannot um you can only use the rubber buttons and you cannot use the scroll wheels
yeah
so i think this is the best of two worlds
okay
okay
okay what about um the issue i um addressed at the beginning of the meeting
um the voice function w with the infrared uh issue
yes
because it it's of cour
it's it's uh i uh i can imagine it's very dull to talk to a device w if you have to point to another device
yeah
it's very unlogical
but most infrared uh remote controls don't have to be pointed at all
well the there has to be some pointing at
well
but
it depends also on your on your
well if you if you take your hand before it okay it won't work but you can point it just to the other wall
well it depends on your walls actually
if you have uh have um smooth walls it it it probably you're probably right
yeah
but if you have carpets on the wall which our natural loving friends probably do have
all lights get absorbed yeah
then um yeah th th it might be a bit more of a issue
yes because the walls they they reflect the infrared light
so
yeah
so it has an it's easier
um i suggest we use the the sensor sample
uh the sample sensor and sample speaker
um with a with a regular chip
and the regular chip
i think uh it gives us the advantage of
and and the scroll uh scroll wheels
yes yes
yeah
i like the scroll wheels uh idea
and uh skip and skip the l. c. d. part
yeah
i don't think it it's any uh value added thing
no
so
think so too
well it looks uh yeah well um according to ruud the the the market likes um new flashy technology
okay
technology
and i mean l. c. d. is well ok i know but it's m it's less um s standard than than
yes
it's not very flashy and new
standard
well we are not very w we do not know uh much about the the f the financial part
that's the problem
mm-hmm
because if we do have enough um space in in our finance i would say do integrate it because
mm-hmm
it it adds a little ext extra high tech feeling to it
yes
but we already have the scroll wheels the sp uh the speaker uh the speak recognition the rubber
mm yeah
uh i think our customers will go insane
the fancy colours
okay okay
it's it's too much
yeah
okay i i agree
i think i ruud do you have any um anything you would like to
um add or or maybe thoughts or
nah um n no i don't think so
m
no
sebast uh nee roo
roo do you have any other
um no
nothing more
nothing more
um
okay
uh the n the next phase will be um
sebas
the um not the what is the next phase f flores
well we we need to describe uh decisions now
okay
so um on the energy well we decided
so i
okay
chip
okay
the case uh rubber with uh c one one uh one curve
okay okay
user interface um
uh but uh can't scroll wheels uh work with one uh one curved case
yes they can work
yeah okay
sorry yeah
they cannot work with double curved
oh sorry
that's that's problem
yeah
i'll check it for you
um then the corporate identity should be uh in the product
i guess that is something for roo and sebastian
uh you talked about it before the colours grey and yellow
yeah
keep it in mind
and um the buttons well we talked about it now
the next phase um sebastian um is um the design of the look and feel
yes
mm-hmm
the user interface design
and for you the product evaluation
um i'm sure your personal coach will give you more information on that
um and uh the i. d. and the u. i. d. need to work together on the prototype drawing on the smartboard
okay
and i'm going uh to plan my holidays
okay
so you will be on the bahamas
the project drawing is for the next
uh
yeah it's it's uh when we come back in thirty minutes uh you will have a uh prototype ready
yeah right
okay
so can you uh give us a summary of all uh decisions we've made
yeah
i can
um maybe one of you could write it down
i'll do
great
um
uh you you need to help me
um
okay
w start with the casing
the casing is curved single curved
single curved
okay single curved case
okay
what about the energy source
traditional batteries uh and solar
but can there be uh wor can they work together
or do we have to choose between them
'cause if we have to choose yeah
no they can be complementary
i i think they can
uh al al i uh
yes
okay
well uh
what if not
every device
it it should be
there should be really no problem
they can be supplementary
okay
that's no problem
yeah
so
okay um th
so uh uh just uh the energy source is um the batteries and the solar
battery and solar yeah
okay
what about uh the finishing of the case
we have decided we wanted to use the rubber
yeah with colourful rubber
yeah
uh if it's possible with uh different um covers but i'm not sure if our suppliers can uh can help us with uh with such uh uh a wish
okay and i think we should use the company colours
something like black and red
uh black and yellow
uh grey and yellow or black and yellow
grey and yellow
grey yellow okay
yeah
yellow case and grey buttons i think
yeah although i don't think that's very colourful
hmm
except for the yellow of course but um i could think of a more uh attractive uh c uh set of colours
oh i think it's uh it's not very dull
it's quite modern actually
don't you think
well i was more thinking about the fruit colours that the ruud showed us before
i believe the
but you have already um you must have a red uh on and off button
and um
well it it doesn't have to be red
well well
uh i mean th uh i think these colours are really what our young people are looking for
um so maybe it shouldn't even be two colours
it should be a full colour cover with such an image or or i mean thinking in two colours is is too black and white for our m uh c uh market group
hmm
okay
i guess
or black and yellow
black and yellow yeah
okay but uh i'm afraid it's not possible to print a picture on uh the device
because uh i agree it would be nice to have have something like that on the device itself
but
well there is
just a week ago a keyboard manufacturer would print with and uh
oh i've read
yeah
yes
yes but our manufacturing department is not so advanced in its uh techniques
no
they're actually very slow in its techniques
okay so we have to deal with wh what's possible here
so
so i'm afraid it's not possible
yeah
okay
um more f more more decisions we made
um
um
a scroll wheel
the scroll heel
yes the voice recognition we already decided
voice recognition of course
okay so scroll wheel
but there will be some additional buttons i guess
yeah
and th the they should be spongy also because they're they're rubber too
uh i'm going to leave that up to you two
what what did you say
well uh you can use well when you use the buttons they'll they'll be made of rubber too
so it has th the spongy uh feel also
yeah
yeah
so i i think that's okay
yeah or you could use plastic buttons
in the rubber
i think rubber is nice
because it uh i i mean what do you touch the button and what do they want spongy uh uh devices or or i
yeah b
but then you just have the the fact that um the drawings on the buttons will disappear eventually
what i said in the in the first uh discussion uh the digit six on the button it will disappear when it's from rubber
uh is that uh does our our supplier say so
it is not uh something uh it's no information i read about it or so but it's just from
uh didn't did we inc uh include the digi digits or uh leave them to the speech recognition
no but but uh it
'cause things like uh volume could be uh placed next to the button
yeah
you could place a um uh this this would be the button
there the icons
the scroll wheel i mean
yeah b yeah
and you could place
the indica th th the signals the
yes
so you don't touch the icons that much
that's okay
yeah that's possible but then you have still the images on the rubber of the case
so still then if you feel uh li uh if you feel your remote control you just rub on the cover so you rub on the painting
no no there's no painting only uh yellow or
yeah
but it's into the rubber
yeah but but the the plus or the minus
yes the signs
you have to draw the
yeah but this is on the pla yeah i know
yeah it's on the cover
um i think uh i know which you understand af uh i know what you mean
so if you uh
you just move the problem
what about um making this rubber
and making this plastic
uh i see what you mean
well maybe that's possible because um uh our manufacturing division also offers plastic finishing
so maybe they can combine these two
yeah
well actually we should have it the other way around i guess
a plastic cover with rubber finishing
i mean this is this is the finishing
this is um what's on the edge
what you feel
yeah
but the front
on which the the buttons are doesn't have to be rubber
mm-hmm
i mean
well i'm i'm not so sure i think it c should be
y uh can you separate these uh these
well i'm not sure i have to ask with manufacturing but i'm i'm not sure that's what you want
because our customers specifically ask for the spongy feel and that's what you get with rubber
so if you want the spongy feel you need uh to make these buttons all all of rubber
i know but do you touch this or do you touch this
i think both
i mean i i never touch between the buttons
i do
i do
or the s uh the sideways
i think
or the the back
yeah the side exactly the sideways
or the back
the side but do you touch between the the these buttons
i think
yes especially when there are l a few buttons on it you have uh a lot of space to touch
so you just have it in your hand completely or or i you play with it
okay
well we do not have very much time uh left
um i guess you two have to figure that out
yeah
i'm going to leave the decision to you um because you have to make its prototype
and um yeah y you have the most knowledge about the suppliers the possibilities and uh so i'm going to leave it the decision with you
yeah
okay
um sebastian did you write enough decisions down
um not quite
um what about
uh the chips
we use the regular chip
regular
okay
yeah
and
use with
well no i think that's about it
yes
okay
with those regular chips we can still uh control advanced functions
the chip is is not really
the only difference between the advanced and the regular version is that the advanced uh version of the chip supports l. c. d.
okay well
that's all
and we've decided not to use l. c. d.
yeah
so
okay
um okay then i think we are uh quite finished
um i'll see you guys in thirty minutes and um
for the finishing touch
yeah
yeah um if you write wrote anything down uh could you put it on the shared folder
okay
okay
uh yeah
yeah
but um
sebastian has everything
i know but well
i'll put it online
great
right
that's the same as uh on the top of it uh with the the round uh button
like this one
but uh we don't uh we don't uh we do think it's um well what if with ease of use
it's important
w which prefers the which the the customer of the user prefers
uh i think th this is device which which has a learning curve
um novice users u use this device as uh normal users use uh a c a remote control
and after a while they start to develop uh some skills in the the voice recognition functions and then they will not use this dial as often
but other users who are new to this device need something like that
okay
they n they need to understand what uh how to change channels and uh change the volume so it's easier for them
could could i see the scroll bar as uh as as a sort of shortcut
yeah maybe so
a a and the voice recognition as well th maybe you could uh could uh
yes it's
well it's it's it's another approach it's more that our um
there are there are many ways of doing uh things uh on such a device
yeah
it's it's quite easy
okay
okay good
and and the case is is rubber
yes rubber
and the buttons
plastic or rubber
there are plastic or rubber
well yeah
okay and uh the colouring
uh yellow with uh
with with grey or black
grey or black or something like that
whatever cost uh cost uh the least
okay we'll we'll come to that later
um
okay
anything else to add or
no
uh maybe we should uh think about these buttons
yeah
well you could use two of them to programme the um channels on the two channel button 'cause you have to assign two channel new channels
but
yes but it but these are tasks that are only executed once i think
m uh yeah
or not
m m but maybe you do want a programme button to uh for example activate the voice recognition or train the voice voice recognition
you
well okay
okay yeah that's right
or something li like that
and a button for disabling the voice recognition
yeah al although by pressing the button for i n don't know two three seconds
you could also say it you'd disable it with a little beep and and but o okay that that's not really really important
yes
yeah
that's the basic idea yeah
the basic okay
of our prototype
okay
um you thought of some evaluation crit criteria
yes
okay
uh my name is not name but
you are nameless
uh well i used the the uh documents
and these uh
were the most important criteria
is it spongy
it should be
yeah that's uh how the fashion guys uh state it
fancy look and feel
so
so just walk through it step by step
i mean is it fancy everything i believe uh
uh well appar
i believe it's fancy
i believe it's fancy too
yeah but apparently uh we shouldn't evaluate yet
no
oh sorry
so
okay
okay so this these are the cr uh the criteria
yeah i think these are the most important criteria
okay well
so uh that's about it
the then we'll switch to my presentation
um
the production costs
the costs are not under
can i
um this is the
twenty two
yeah it's it's w way above um uh above the the the twelve euro fifty
yikes
and what makes it very expensive is uh for example the solar cell
well it's very expensive
so i guess we should skip that because it's not that important
okay
why does the price and and the s oh one uh exa yeah
yeah the the price the the number of items and the the sum
the number of uh yeah
okay
um well this is what i would call our luxury model
um if you would if you look at the uh w w w what we could do to make it more um
and and does it
to make it just between the twelve euro fifty um then i
did the following changes
twelve euro forty cents i came up with by leaving out the solar cells
mm-hmm
um by not using the voice recognition feature because it's uh it's a four euro uh addition to the price
mm-hmm
um
yeah i believe
uh push button well
it makes it the thirteen yeah
push buttons are buttons are are not the most expensive but do add extra cost
hmm
so um yeah th this design is not um
within our price model
okay
um
but i'm afraid it's not complete
because we use spec uh specic uh special materials the last item
and you have not added one item there
yeah
so it's c way too expensive
it's still too expensive yeah
but that's that's only for the buttons
um
so the button we can use plastic
i i guess if we leave the if we leave this one out um oh
and uh maybe not use the special form
and the pla uh
and a plastic b just plastic buttons a plas uh instead of rubber
but it
it becomes a very dull remote control i know
yes
but it's the board decision
um
and um yeah
well b basically it when when this is our only option we should even consider changing the casing
because i think there's very little added value in uh an enhanced case with these dull functions
yeah
yeah i know
so
maybe we should look at an uh focus on another uh
type of m maybe another market segment
yeah m uh maybe not not all that fancy but just way way more easy uh uh um basic and uh m maximise the profits and um
yeah
yes
that's maybe that's better
yeah
maybe we could uh we should go for straight and simple but that's not what uh has been asked
yeah
i know i know
so we should kick the board's uh well
yeah
although i think we yeah
but we could still make uh a remote control that ap uh um applies um more to young people uh by giving it another colour already
hmm
um so it is possible to make uh uh a device that attracts a little bit more to young people
yes
um but uh i agree it's it's not a fancy high tech uh device
definitely not no
it's not that innovative
or however you s pronounce that
um so okay
yeah too bad
um
oh this is the wrong one
so uh that means redesign
we do not have the time o uh now to to redesign the product
mm-hmm
um but we can evaluate the process and um uh
uh the satisfaction on how things went
um i'm not sure if we need to evaluate uh the device first
i guess
um well since we're not gonna manufacture it anyway
yeah
yeah that's true
well maybe it's good to do it anyway because if we evaluate it we we can also determine if our objectives are good
we l we can learn
yeah
yeah
so
i agree
well
is it fancy
i d it is it is
uh
yay
is it
is it fancy
yeah i think so
um the yellow rubber i think so
i think so
you like the rubber uh roo
i'm into it
so uh one
but it's not that fancy
yeah
no i'll i'll i'll give it a two
i mean
i think uh i think it would have been more fancy if we used the titanium housing the casing
it would be even more oh you really like titanium
you like tita
i'm i'm into it
that's a flavour as well
it has flavour
yes that's right
right
you should taste it
um
is it uh
yeah i know but but it but that's fancy in the way um
i mean fancy has has a lot of
it has to do with fashion i guess
yeah
so do
it's trendy trendy fun yeah
and w yeah w what they want wanted was uh colours and soft materials
so in that way
yeah
it applies
it yeah
it it's fancy
well just give it a two
okay
yeah
yes
i think i th i think it would have been i would have think uh it could have been more fancy by using the double curved case
it's not the ultimate uh fancy two but
it would have been even more fancy but we decided not to because if we use a double curved case we could not use solar
yeah but that's sti that's uh
so
looking at the user uh needs we only uh don't we don't have the double curved case
we w we do have uh the rubber we do have the colours
that's two out of three
yes
so i believe uh we are close uh to two
yeah i i agree
yes i agree too
it's okay
we did yes we did good
okay and uh was it
innovative
well with the voice recognition feature and uh
but that's not in it
yep
ov or can we
no we are evaluating this this uh design now
well let's let's this product
okay
so i i i think it is
this prototype
i think it's innovative
yeah
and the scroll uh wheel
the solar not many remotes
have the solar i think
no
it could have been a little bit more innovative u by using the kinetic uh energy source but it's it's way too yes but
yeah and uh
that would have been a thrill
so uh also a uh two
i think uh it's a two
yep
is it easy to use
i'm not sure
yeah
i'm not sure
well yeah the voice recognition of course is hard to learn i think
well hard it's not for the for the e for the elderly
well but there are two parts in this remote control
they won't use it
what you see here is is the basic part
everybody can use it so that's easy to use
yeah
that's for a novice user
when you have a more advanced elaborate user well such a user really would like to explore all these additional functions
so in that in that way it is advanced
yeah
and i think it's easy to use for for both uh types of users
so uh
i think
it's maybe it's not very uh easy for
i think a three
wouldn't give it more
uh i'm doubting doubting as well
um
well the p the most important function is easy to use
yeah
the the zapping channel switching volume
but the more advanced functions are probably
a bit harder
okay
uh two or three
three
wha wh what would be your guess
i mean ease of use um does not only apply to the most basic functions
okay
it's the uh it's it's overall
is the device easy to use
yeah that's right
you're right in that but i i guess uh an advanced user will will find the voice recognition function easy to use
yeah
because he is already he or she is already an advanced user
yeah
so
after all i think personally i would give a two
um
but
okay
uh roo a three
yep
ruud
good question
uh i'll go uh for the two
okay
so it's two two and three
two threes
so that's ten
so i could make it e easy
if you make it a four it will be three in general
so that's w
no two and a half
if he makes it a four
six and four
not a three
six and four is ten
divided by four is two and a half
so
darn
nee
hmm
yes
roo
huh
a seven a three no
yeah
a four and a three together
i yeah
four
yeah you have a two he has a two
yeah two two three
two
three
and a three
no i haven't said anything yet
no
nee
i know
okay but if i would say a three then it's six and four is ten
divided by four
divided by four is two point five
yes
so if you want to have the conclusion as a three three
then you would make a four
if you fill out a four
that's not even
but i'm filling in a three
does it will so it will be a two point five
but that's not possible to fill in so we have to round it
yes it is
i have a veto
exactly
it's not about the content it's about okay um is it easy to f
is it easy to find
yeah definitely
yes
yeah we haven't re uh re uh really worked it out but you c you can you can just say find and he repeats find
it it most definitely is it's very easy
yeah or beeps or yeah
yeah but that's the that's the the basic idea of the the speaker uh
yes
maybe uh i i think i think something like that
i'm here i'm here
maybe you have to uh programme it once so to that l respond to uh a certain word or a certain sentence
yeah
yeah
something like where are you and then it will sing i'm here
but even without it
yeah
so something like that
so i th
well i uh we should not uh stay too long on this subject uh because of the time but i personally give it a one
yeah
um sebastian
yeah me too
me too
yeah i agree
right well
the feel of the remote control is spongy
well uh it can't be more spongy
so
well it can be
there are cases um in which the outside casing is um can be uh how d how do you prono is is moldable
was it one of our options
no it's not one of our option but when you look in the market when you look
no
uh this this was a most spongy option
no okay but but
so in the in
for the options given it's the most spongy one
uh yes but that's not that's not uh what they are talking about i think
yeah
because we compare all these uh characteristics characteristics with uh market uh with with the real market
yeah
so there are uh remote controls out there which are a lot more spongy
yeah
they're out there
but i think in this case in this case we've done the best we could
they're out there
yes but it's not good enough so it's a two
yeah
i'll give it a one
i wan i'll take one
you take one
what do you give it
well yeah it depends 'cause it's the most spongy we could but yeah
yeah i know but you have to name a fig uh a number
because we need to go on in for the time
well if i give it a one
it will be a one
there'll be one hell of a calculation
so i'll just give it a two and make this a one point five
no no no
uh i'll i'll change it i'll make it m my my mark will be a four
you are okay
the remote control offers enough features
well ruud what what do you think about it
well the basic layout doesn't offem offer much but the voice recognition could add a lot
so
basically it's it's completely programmable
yeah depends
yeah
you can add very m much functionality by uh using the voice recognition mode
yeah i know
so it's quite advanced
what what we didn't talk about is um uh
yeah but it ha doesn't has the digits
i believe it's
if you uh ask yourself it offers enough features i don't i don't think
it is it has all the features um a normal remote has
i think it has
uh depends on what you uh implement in the speech feat
yeah
bec because you can um we didn't talk about it but you do have uh remote controls that are able to adapt another signal
yes
so you place a a regular uh remote control in front of the other one hit the one or the two or the three
whatever and it r records the uh the um the the signals
has uh the signals sent to it
signal
yeah
so you could uh uh uh
enter any comment you like as long it's able to as long as our device is able to reproduce the infrared signal
so i think th this uh this is uh a a remote control with a very high level of features
absolutely
although there are i a few buttons but the inside is is quite uh advanced
yes
but that that's its power i guess because uh a regular programmable uh remote control contains well uh really a lot of buttons
yeah
at at least uh forty buttons
yeah
so it's it's quite s complicated to get uh to get used to
and this is quite s simple
you can use your voice to to programme it
yep
it's
yeah
okay um let's give it a number
i'll give it uh a one
for for the for this t uh type of market i think it's a one
i'll give a two
yeah i'll give it a one
um i think think a one 'cause v with a voice recognition you could add anything you want so that's like um
yes
i i've i think we've uh succe succeed in in developing a product that's actually quite good
but not for this kind of market and not for this kind of price
so
yeah
so high quality low acceptance
hmm
the product is is is uh b high qua uh has a high quality and and is uh advanced
yes
but
whether or not our clients are are um willing to pay twenty five euros for this kind of device is doub is well is not sure
mm-hmm
mm-hmm
d do you agree
yes i agree
maybe even because it doesn't look advanced
i
yeah
yeah okay
maybe we should have a radar uh function
but
yes
but we could couldn't uh what what's the selling price
fifty
twenty five euros
uh twenty five
and costs were twelve fifty
yeah
but even now if only our production costs w uh were exceeded the double
think
production cost was were t uh was twenty two
mm-hmm
so uh selling price uh would be uh yeah
m about fifty euros
that's quite ex well it's not it's not very expensive for a remote control that that has this functionality
that's price but w w
no
an original remote control of any t. v. kind uh a phillips remote control y you pay uh
yes it's more than fifty euros
it's quite expensive yes
yeah i kn i know uh from a few years ago it it it costed hundred gilders
bu but well yeah i know but you're paying for th for the brand
because there are uh remote controls which control your stereo television d. v. d. c. d. player for under twenty five euros
yes
yes but you can you c
yes but you can learn this thing all these functions
and it's easier to use because those uh remote controls don't offer voice recognition and this one does
yeah
yeah
so i think it's worth its price
okay
um you had an overall rating
um
yeah but uh with these ratings uh
that's counting
well it's it's about one point five
should be about one point s seven yeah
four six seven eight
something like that
okay
nine divided by six
okay
um we'll go further on with the the rest of the evaluation
about the project itself not about the product
um
what did you think about uh
the process the project process
ruud
try to translate that
well
hmm
any any other uh roo
well i think
yeah i think uh
ye
roo
the process was good
but w um we weren't aware of the prices of the costs
yeah
and and that was the the big deal
mm
i if we knew that before we c we could have made the the choice between what yeah
actually we had
better decision
yes
we had we had too little information actually
yeah
so and uh um the the the well looking at room for creativity there was
w way too the the choice of components was way too narrow
less
so there was not really a process of uh
yeah
so we could we we could be we could've been creative
but um it was tempered by the choice of components and the the price
well
yes
the prices
well in the first meeting we we already were very creative
we we thought of possibilities who are not possible uh with the the current uh offer of uh manufacturing components
yeah
so
yeah
we're tempered by that yes
okay roo
any other thoughts on that
no no
ruud
i agree
you agree okay
uh leadership
fantastic
okay roo's on for his promotion
yeah okay
okay
i think we're a good team
i think so too it's it's it's uh of course a laboratory environment
i missed it um to be able to contact you in between and uh say uh hey roo uh
yes
yeah
um
well i tried once but that was not allowed
yeah
so um
yeah but but si uh w w w when taken in account the the situation uh i think we performed pretty well
i think so too
yeah
yeah
um the means the smartboard the digital pen
did you like 'em
uh
the digital pen was okay but smartboard was really bad
yeah
it it's
because of the response or
the response is very slow and the possibilities are very limited
response and
it's not accurate
okay
uh it it has yeah
uh
yeah it's not accurate
the p the pointing of the pen is not um the place where it it writes its um uh where it uh
draws
yeah where it draws
it's uh the drawing on on the b on the board is r right from the pen
okay so it it had to be um
so uh
you to take in account that your you m yeah uh
better aligned or what's the word
uh yeah
maybe it's it needs to be calibrateds
it's too slow
it it was calibrated just before this meeting
uh the one before the third meeting
it is
okay
so uh it's not the calibration it's the thing itself i think
hmm
okay
uh ruud w uh did you use the pen a lot
or not at all
no
not at all
not really
okay
i thought it was quite a handy uh thing although i would like to see um o. c. r.
i i think so too
yes
yep
yes
if it has o. c. r. uh i think uh i would use but uh i i just uh took notes for myself and and and that's it
yeah
it w it w yeah
it was necessary for me to uh
to digitise them
yeah because if i want something on the computer i just type it
yeah
mm-hmm
i type faster than i write
so
yeah
but i think it's a great solution for uh for uh a known problem uh writing down some notes
some some inf uh information and then um forgetting your notebook somewhere and losing all that information
yeah
because you have everything in one place and it's quite easy quite easy it's it's possible to make this information digital and share it with others in a quite easy way
yeah
i think it's a good product
i only think it's th the the shape of the pen is too big
yeah
it's not quite uh ergonomic
economic
eco ergonomic
i know
yeah
okay
um
what w uh ruud what did you think about the smartboards
oh i only use it to draw a rabbit so can't say much about it
yeah
okay you can't really decide
no
i missed a feature to easily select uh a slide and uh distribute it to the laptops
i think that would be very easy if you could say okay i want to use this for my own work or my own presentation further on or
yes
no or the other way around
yeah
or the other way around that you could show but m
yes yes
that's quite what powerpoint does
but y you can if you save this image you can open it in your shared work folder
yeah
i know
i know but
so it's almost yeah
i know but we couldn't use that feature so i missed it
yep
we weren't able to do that
at least the um i wasn't explained how to do such a th
mm-hmm
a and the function of of filling an an uh an oval or an an object
an object yes
yes
the drawing cap capabilities are very limited
i it's not possible yeah
okay
and and uh w you were when you're using uh windows you're used to a certain interface and certain buttons uh which you can use for drawing
yeah
and a lot of these buttons don't appear here
so it's
oh it looks like paint actually
okay so y it it's not even as advanced as paint
not not uh n not way
yeah
it's quite uh limited
okay
uh no
yeah the project is evaluated
um but well we need to redesign uh the product
okay
oh very good celebration
celebrate
pop uh pop up the champagne
great
it was a privilege working with you
okay
um you're dismissed
no i think we are uh ready
okay
to private rooms
i see some action over there
private room roo
that sounds quite scary
okay
no let's find uh the way to
uh we're done we're finished i believe
so
are there any more cycles in this process
i think not
i don't believe so
well maybe we'd
get an email
thank you for your
but um how much time did we get for this meeting
forty minutes
and how much time is left
a minute or or ten maybe
m yeah ten or five
ten minutes
okay
okay
so we can uh
redesign our uh
uh i would like to
well i think we we we all know what the redesign should be
a simple dull uh one coloured box
and no added value
no it's it's just the same product that is already on the market
at all
so
oh
but you see the problem y you can't continue your uh your line
yeah
well it's fluffy alright
spongy
what is that
a giraffe
yeah
it's a giraffe eating a eating leaves from a tree
it's blue tongue
in interesting design
yeah
this is a new model
but
so you're actually promoting bluetooth
or blue tongue
blue tongue
oh uh it it does uh have a natural uh feeling
it's spongy
so
yeah
that is uh it's a new feature next to bluetooth to um disable all bluetooth devices
blue tongue
okay
right
um
let's wrap it up
yeah we're done here
gentlemen thank you for your cooperation
thank you mister manager
now let's have uh a bottle of champagne
yes
that's alright
okay good morning
this is our first team meeting
good day
morning
morning
i'll be your project manager for today for this project
my name is mark will be giving this presentation for you to kick the project off
that's my uh that's the agenda for today
well of course we're new to each other so i'd like to get acquainted first
so let's do that first i mean let's start with you can you introduce yourself
you're our marketing expert
yes
um my name is dirk dirk meinfeld
um i will be uh pr project the marketing expert
and i will see what the user wants and uh what we can do uh with the new produ project product
okay excellent
and you are user interface yeah
nick broer user interface designer
i'm going to uh look at the technical design from the uh user point of view
excellent
okay
my name is xavier juergens i'm the industrial designer and there are three main questions that i have to find an answer to today
first one is uh what happens inside the apparatus second is what is uh the apparatus made of and the third is what should it look like
hmm
what should it look like
okay
hmm
oh let's kick it off
oh there we go
so our new project is about we need design a remote control for television set so which has to be original trendy and user friendly
i took this off our corporate website
it's i think well it sums up what we need to do
we're inspired by latest fashion not only electronics but also the latest trends in clothes and interior design
that's why our product will always fit in your home
so apparently we need to um be very at um very open to what's currently hot in the market
so that's what you need to do to bring us the latest info and what people want
yeah
yeah
so
so we put the fashion in electronics
so that's what we need to go for
anyway we'll take this project in three steps three pha uh three phase of design
first step will be the functional design
yeah
and that's basically what we're gonna do
everybody has uh a piece of individual work and a meeting afterwards
so we can share information about so i'm gonna keep this short since we had a technical problem
so skip through this
uh
okay
every meeting we everybody can present their uh their views and everything so to help with these you have we have the smartboards here
we can use a regular powerpoint presentation
i'm supposed to give you an introduction on this doodling board so it's actually it's very easy
like it says very simple you just take out the pen
like you see here i'll just take the take here
that's it you just put it on the board
you see a pen here
you go here just like using a pen
you can just draw whatever you want
it's like the eraser can erase whatever you want
and so it will be easy just to illustrate your views if you wanna change the format you just either take out jus just like the pen
and whatever you want your current colour your line width just to make the line bigger
so it should be really easy
okay
this is to take the just take a new slide and back again
we're just gonna keep using this board all the time so i think it will be it's very clear for everyone i suppose
so i'll take this out
okay
we'll use that later
anyway
yeah just just just stuff that you wanna share just put it in the in the project folder like i put my presentation now
i'll put the the minutes of every meeting i'll put them there too so everybody can read up if they have to leave early or whatever
so next been here
well gonna give the electronic white board uh a shot
so basic idea is
we have a blank sheet
just try whatever you want and like it says draw your favourite animal
i think the creative genius should go first
the creative genius
thank you very much
so draw us your favourite animal
well i'm more into the technical aspects of drawing so i'm not really good at drawing animals but uh the animal which i oh
draw us a technical animal
yeah it's still erasing
pen
uh format
else my animal will be like king size
i pretty much like a dolphin because of its uh its freedom basically
let's see
a head
actually worked with this
it's like uh it's a very
uh high tech
bit low responsive though
prefer pen and paper
so that's what we don't want
we want a high responsive product
so
it looks more like nuclear bomb
very nice dolphin
it doesn't look like a nuclear bomb
this thing isn't doing what i'm
what i want
so
let's go easy on it
yeah well it does look like a nuclear bomb
i'll just finish up real soon because i'm
so it doesn't really look like a dolphin but then again this is all new for me
anyway it should it it's supposed to be a dolphin you like the freedom that it that it represents
uh-huh
like the ocean like swimming
do that in my spare time so that's basically an
what do you like
okay
well our marketing expert
now we can forget this ever happened
show us an animal
um an animal
i like the elephant
pick a pick a pick a clean sheet
oh
what
take a clean sheet first
yeah
um
just press next
that's it
oh yeah
oh a blank
okay next
free i like the elephant
it's big it's strong so uh uh oh it's a little bit
it's not really that responsive no
you have to hold it right
mm
hmm
it's a beautiful animal
oh you have to p press it pretty hard
with a smile on it it's very important
it's a cute elephant
yeah
and uh not to forget its tail
oh
it's a nice beard
yeah it's okay
and you was making comments on my dolphin
yes
i will beat the dolphin
no
okay so it's just a bee
yeah
so i suggest you make us the elephant in the market
the big and strong player in the market
yeah
this would be good
yeah
okay excellent
on to the next one
okay
uh yeah
okay you should press next
yeah
press next
yeah it's up there
okay
that's it
okay well the animal i'd like to draw is a tiger
you picked a hard one didn't you
experience with the tiger
my drawing skills are really bad so
what
they are
they are really bad my drawing skills
okay uh-huh
sure looks smooth
oh
i'm not sure how the legs should go but
uh these are stripes
got it
i've picked this animal because it's very fast
it is uh it knows exactly what it wants
uh it hardly ever wastes any resources
what does it want
uh well basically uh it hunts for prey but it does it always in a very well thought way
uh it knows exactly what it wants
it never kills an animal uh just for the killing so it's very efficient
and it tries to do everything as fast as possible
okay
and it always goes for uh security in seeking uh uh a hide spot and uh and doing everything security speed and efficiency is important
mm
and i think uh those things we can use
i agree
okay
yay i'm supposed to draw the animal next
i introduce to the world the amazing
ant
uh hard worker
great team workers
yeah
yeah
do everything to uh really small but together they're really strong
so i'm gonna give it a smiley face
yeah yeah
oh
not sure where the p
just put 'em here
whatever
think it need shoes
so
i'm just too lazy to draw it all black so
that's the coolest ant ever
you've done this before haven't you
i love to draw ants
it's my hobby
anyway nah
just i think it's very representative what we drew i guess
like you take just take your freedom and use a a trendy interface that you design for us
yeah
just yeah
you're supposed to make i make it different from uh from what other people have and just make it a little distinct
anyway
another beep to stop the meeting
see
warning
finish meeting now
uh put this down
examples
well i guess we have a little little time extra but just a little quick discussion to to open open our work
so what do you guys think about the first idea is just very short
i'll start with you
what are y what are your first ideas for the new product
well i basically had a question
what
do uh are we going to introduce a multi remote control
is it just the t. v. or do we want to in
uh
the project i got was just for a t. v. remote control
just for t. v. remote control
yeah
yeah i guess so
okay
well i was thinking about design remote control with our uh motto and all
but
uh thing to keep in mind is that we need to stick to what people are familiar with
yeah
no rational changes or whatever 'cause it revolutionary changes yes
okay so very intuitive design i guess
uh we might have to consider other design aspects of our product
so that was something i wanted to add and perhaps some usability aspect
t. v. is becoming central in most homes
do we want people who are disabled in any way to uh yeah to be able to use it as well
yeah we want
i suppose we want almost everyone to be using it
so i think i mean really disabled people yeah might be a problem but i think it's a little take it into consideration
um yeah
i think we really need to cut the meeting short
you have anything you wanna share quickly
hmm
uh
only one thing uh that has to be added according to me is uh the the material it is made of it should be something light
that's it speaks for itself but some uh yeah
yeah
it should be light okay
yeah
um let's see where did i let's skip that
oh this is it
sorry i skipped this sheet
selling price
what do we this quick what we're going to selling price twenty five euros
that's for you
the production price twelve and a half euros approximately
okay
just go go for that
we'll reach the uh reach that profit
okay
okay well that's not that much to work with
international
no it's not much to work on
i'm sorry i skipped it
anyways that's yeah this is it
do you have anything you you came up with yet
about uh marketing transfer whatever
um about what
marketing
marketing i'm not sure what you what you came up with yet
you have anything to share
or else we'll cut the meeting just cut the meeting short since we're supposed to stop
um no not really yet but i've some ideas and i will uh
okay
anyways the the personal coach will give you the your p your personal assignments and everything
say it uh
so we'll just meet back in here thirty minutes
okay
okay
i'm sure we have that
good luck everyone
yeah thanks for attending
mm good luck
i'll see you back here in thirty minutes
okay
yes
wait for the marketing director actually so
anyways
uh
see shall we wait
i'm not sure if he's late or delayed or whatever so i'm gonna start soon we have now don't have much time anyway
oh there he is
yes
okay we
there you are okay
sorry a little bit of pl little problem with computer
uh no problem
we're about to start so have a seat
okay welcome again
today functional design phase
i'll take you over the minutes of last last meeting
okay that was just to get to know each other have a little thoughts on what your vision is and on this project so
uh
i put the minutes on the i made on the on the p the the project share so if you wanna review them they're there
i will do so after every meeting so if you have some information you wanna take back you can find it there
anyways um today three presentations from every one of you
um after that i got some new project requirements from project board so we're gonna go af go after over this later
but i wanna start with uh stuff you did first so we can see what everybody came up with
and after that we can have the new requirements and share some thoughts so
who would like wanna go first
yeah sure no problem
go ahead
take it
um there was a little problem with my computer so not uh the whole uh presentation uh
anyway let's see what you have
yeah
um
okay and
uh it's still a bit open
i want to open the my s oh no
you should close it on your own notebook i guess
yeah
oh no that's okay
so there
okay
uh slide show
yes
the functional requirements it's uh uh very important for uh the user he he wants to yeah
the the method we used uh it it's not m not a slide because it went wrong but the method we use uh
um we tested it w uh with uh a hundred uh men
and we asked them to w uh what the remote uh f feel uh like and uh what what's uh important
if i can cut in is it people or men
uh
people sorry
is it people okay
both women and men yeah
'cause i thought it was only men so 'kay
okay
uh the findings um uh seventy five percent of the users find most remote controls ugly
um
that's pretty shocking uh
so we have to s we have to do something about that
yeah and yeah most th th they want to spend money for a better system for better remote control
so we can do uh a l a little uh nice things with it and um they use yeah
they use zap a lot um uh fifty percent say they only
so that's the most important things
okay
um oh yeah not all of it is it on mine
on my powerpoint presentation but um uh the relevant buttons are the power the channel selection and the volume selection
okay just talk ahead
it's uh the most basic buttons that a user wants uh to use
mm-hmm
uh less important is tel teletext
mm-hmm
uh um they use it
but it's not uh very uh important uh on the scale of zero to ten they six and a half uh and but not important is the channel selection
okay that's okay
the the hmm
that's a little weird
oh the the no no no no no that's very important but uh w and not important in the audio settings display settings and uh
which channel selection
okay we can we can hide those under a menu or something okay
oh okay
yeah
um new preferences preferences
uh um um beep to find your control was that was in the test
that's like a button on your t. v.
the the most people uh f find it uh irritating uh when they cannot find a rem their remote control
mm
remote okay
so uh i think it's a bee beep to sound it and uh you can find it
and another thing uh they want was uh speech recognition um so they can say uh what they want to let's go to channel one and uh that's uh kind of things
okay
and they want maybe an uh l. c. d. screen um to to look it um wh what's on every channel uh and uh what do i want with it
we wanna have a little preview on the remote control
yeah
preview what's on the channel
okay
is that manageable
'cause it sounds pretty expensive too
that sounds too it's possible but uh i think it's expensive but do continue
yeah
okay
yeah
um
uh my personal preferences is uh a button for my favourite channel so i can uh i dunno so i can zap to my uh
f uh quick uh to my favourite channel wh what i uh so the remote mu must see or um
must um see wha what mine preferences are for which channel so i can zap t to
okay you don't set it yourself it just remembers the channel that you are on most for example
what
you want the you want it to be programmed for example y programmed f or you want it to recognise your favourite channel
yeah
yeah
recognise
let's see you you spend twenty minutes each day on that channel so it recognises your favourite channel
yeah
yeah that's uh what my personal preference like
okay so it's it it does it recognise itself you don't have to set it okay
no itself
maybe it's easier to to sell it but
okay
i don't know it's manageable but we will uh we will see
i see
yeah it's a little bit uh it's the end of it
it's a little bit uh i lost it the computer uh crashed so
okay
okay
no problem it's it's okay that's yeah go ahead
shall i go
okay
yeah
so some technical functions
darn computer
basically i have some issues which you discussed earlier
yeah
uh let's just start with the method
it sounds really easy what does the user do what does the th remote control do but there are quite some issues
so the things i'm going to concentrate on are the user aspect because the technical aspect that's pretty much covered
we can do that
what goes wrong
at the user
gets the remote control
where is the remote control
we've all had it once i want to watch some television where's the remote control
yeah
that was one of your ideas which you posted in the network folder a really good idea
yeah
that seems very good
uh these are just the issues
i come to some uh personal experience findings possible solutions later
searches for the button
there are many buttons on a remote control which are not clear
uh so either we lose those or we try to make it a little bit more clear
mm uh
mm-hmm
uh also symbols tend to fade after a while
there's nothing more annoying than faded symbols because you don't know which channel is this button so possibly we could find uh something for that yes
okay so have it more make it more durable actually
okay
uh covered that
oh yes user presses the button
um usually when you have a lot of buttons buttons are small
so you press more once remote control goes
okay so the buttons should be
kablouey or something like that so we have to pay attention not to put too mun too many buttons on uh the remote control
mm-hmm
yeah
and possibly also the size so more important buttons bigger si
wow
the s yeah
make it make them bigger
even more durable uh
so this is basically what i h had in mind in the fade proof symbols locator a sound uh so clear we should stick to existing symbols
but maybe we could do a little uh investigation to see whether some symbols are uh need to be replaced by others
okay
uh
this i pretty much covered
so what we want to go to is not this one but more less buttons easy some bigger buttons
yeah it's true
yeah
so that's basically uh what i had in mind
yeah that's clear
this is not the final design this is just a general idea of how i'd like to see uh basically the general idea
no of course uh
yeah
i must say that it
so that was it
hmm
that was it
okay that was good
so we agree on the the part that we need to get something on the on the remote to find it somewhere and increase it the durability of of the thing
yeah i think it's a really good idea
so the other aspects we'll just see how what you came up with and what's possible for that budget
yeah
yeah
okay
okay that's fine
um
okay now work a little with me
okay
well let's start it as it is
okay uh the method
there are a few questions that need to be answered uh you already uh talked about it a little bit
which buttons are wanted uh is our remote control universal or should it be programmable
uh if it should be programmeab grammeale then we need um something like a mode that you can switch it
because then the buttons have to send out a different signal then they would normally do
mm-hmm
and uh how big is the remote control uh going to be
i'll tell you why that's important to me
um there are a lot of technical parts in the remote control
so uh uh that's why i also would like to say uh go a little bit easy on the designs
uh i heard ab uh you talking about beeps and about uh video screens but uh the material inside and the technical aspects are quite complex already
mm-hmm
so keep in mind that everything that you keep uh think of it has to b to be built
so it's that's not as easy as it s might look like
yeah
of course hmm
okay
uh material study i'm working on that um for the the costs
i have to check out how far i can go with that
normally a circuit board is made of fibreglass uh and the wires are made of copper
uh that is how it is done and all the remote controls work that way i think we can just go on with that
um then i've read more integration of materials means less cost for the production
the more we can make uh at once uh in one piece uh that is cheaper
you mean integrate them all into the circuit board
exactly so if we make a circuit board with the the connections already on it then that's cheaper
okay
yeah okay
so we have to make something that's not too difficult in design again
so you have
this is what look like uh looks like if you press one button so this is not the entire thing
you have the the power coming in then you have like a switch
the switch uh uh uh if you p press it then some electrical charge goes into the processor
that thinks over a morse code that's how you should see it
the morse code goes to the amplifier then uh the signal is sent to two uh light bulbs
you have infrared and an interv um uh how to say it
uh a light in indication light that you know that it's functioning
mm-hmm
uh here again that's my story about the different modes if you do want to make remote uh universal
then the processor has to uh make up a different morse code when some button is pressed
that makes it much more complex so we really need to have a look do we want that or not
uh i don't have any personal p uh preferences uh so far except for uh the materials to be used uh light that they are light
okay
okay
that was it
that was it
i'll get back to my thing then
uh
okay back this up to the screen
so i got some new information on the project specifications are changing a little
like you said uh teletext is not not very popular anymore because the uh the internet
nowadays people don't use the teletext anymore or hardly so it can either
well i don't think we should remove the button because there are always people who are using it
yeah
but i don't think it should be very it should be one of the big buttons for example
just put it somewhere or under second option or whatever
it's not important anymore
um we're targeting young people now because our um
this is a new product and with this new product we want to appeal to younger people which are um the younger people were defined under forty
uh
yeah
hmm
i so i think it's that's also good with the fashion and everything so yeah
b
yeah and they want to pay for it and uh
they want to pay for it people are willing to spend money actually to buy a um remote that they like
with more
if they like the way it looks the way it functions so they're actually gonna spend uh spend money on it
where with more technical specifications
yeah
in the
see how far we can go with it anyway so and one thing that should be important is that the corporate l colour and slogan are recognisable
yeah
which is apparently black and yellow but
i'm not sure if we i think we should keep the the logo in mind
because with colours you can uh have a lot of uh fashionable colours and everything on it which suits everybody's taste
so
with that concept i started thinking
so why not just steal nokia's idea and just make changeable covers for your i mean those cost hardly anything i think and people could even spend extra money
oh
yeah
on buying a cover and so have an entire new remote control that they like to see
or we can sh for example we can make a different a basic design
and sell the covers separately for example
that's just a little marketing idea that could be applied so you can p it appeals to really everyone
so you don't have to i think you don't have to make entire remote controls
we make a basic one and manufacture this cover separately
mm-hmm
so that was that was my idea on what we could do to appeal this product to everyone
hmm
so just
i'm not sure if you came up with anything in the meantime after making a presentation
yeah
would you like to share
no i think this is a good idea
okay
but
but oh
is it manageable
go ahead
yeah with with an l. c. d. screen you can
is it easy
oh yeah
i think we should lose the l. c. d. screen like you said
y
yes i think so too
why
yeah
i think for example it's it's huge i think the l. c. d. is huge it consumes batteries like hell
nokia w
uh
i think it takes up a lot of a lot of power
yeah
and it costs too much to fabricate so we're on a tight budget here
it costs a lot i think
okay uh
okay
what we could do what could be possible is maybe not an l. c. d. screen but with a preview but y i'm not sure if it's even possible
mm
for example a little t. v. guide
hmm
like you have a little just just a text only not colour just a little text thing so you can use your remote as a t. v. guide
mm-hmm
yeah
i'm not sure it's even possible but maybe okay make it yeah find a little compromise in that but what did i write down
hmm
i have to check that out i'm not sure
yeah
i think the p yeah the beep is a very simple thing to imple implement
just make a button on your t. v. and just hit the button it beeps somewhere
that must be possible
i think it's easy to implement we should go for that
ja
i'm sorry whe where do you wanna hit the t. you wanna we want a button on the television
and it's
uh speech recognition
i thin yeah i mean where else should you put it
in th okay but that rules out a universal remote control
because that's not possible uh
yeah but how are you gonna use that if your i mean if your remote control is lost
uh
how are you gonna press where are you gonna press the button
yeah
exactly
maybe just a slap on sticker with a button which sends out a small signal
a slap on sticker
oh you mean as like a separate thing you can attach to your t. v.
mm uh
yeah exactly
yeah that could be possible
a little little box you can attach to your t. v. is fine then okay
okay then uh i'd i'd like to know now if we want the uh universal remote control or not because that's uh determines everything i'm gonna do
i think it's universal
i think we should go for universal because apparently we're a separate company making separate c remote controls to sell to a lot of diverse people
if not okay
yeah
i think universal remote control should be possible
um
okay then i go for that
everyone uh wants to buy it so we w yeah
yeah i think we're targeting everyone so remote
yeah
okay
no it's fine with me but then i know what to look for
okay universal is good
speech recognition i think it's very hard because we're selling across multiple countries
so i think implementing speech recognition is such a small um apparatus it's very hard to do
yeah
or one
or when you say one two uh i it uh it's enough right
and it's
yeah but i don't see arabian people speaking one two uh whatever
but
oh yeah
besides that the technology isn't really super yet so that is a problem in implementing this
it's yeah
yeah
it's not a mature technology i think it takes a lot of memory and everything in in a remote control so
okay
it's a good idea but it's just not i don't think the market's ripe for that yet
i don't think it should be implemented in a remote control yet uh
uh-huh
yeah
what else do we have
um well you should you should look into the in into the materials that are real durable
mm-hmm
so the the the symbols won't fade maybe a little harder plastic or especially li we don't maybe we don't have have to do all the buttons
exactly
i already noted that
but especially the ones that are um the popular buttons so those always fade first
mm okay
okay
mm the thing is the most important things that we have now
hmm
let's see
if we uh make a remote control with changeable covers then we can also make uh a cover for every language area
that's fo is uh especially for older people that they can read it read it in their own language
for example
well we're not we're not targeting older people we should remember that
yeah
everything we target is under forty so
that's okay okay
you assume that that they read correctly and i think they're the most important thing about young people is that they're really sensitive to to trends that are passing through the world
huh
but b
uh okay
so
but should the exchangeable covers include the buttons themselves or just the
no of course
no i think it's just something you you put over them because yeah we c yeah you ca well
hmm
but every
c that's a problem with the with the text then
tha that's not a that's not a bad that's not even it's not even a bad idea
hmm
i mean for example if you're if you're into the durability issue
you could for example if your buttons are faded
after i mean if you make a durable remote they are faded you can just buy a new cover
mm
uh i'm not sure it's it's hard to make
okay
uh but i know that the buttons are like a nokia telephone on uh one sleeve so you don't have to change your whole cover
so it's a good and a bad idea
mm-hmm
uh we can make something that you can only remove the sleeve
know what i mean
oh
oh yeah i know what you mean
it works the same as a nokia telephone it's it's in my uh 'kay
yeah i know it's just just a one one piece of rubber for example okay
yeah
exactly
yeah
yeah that's what i something i have to look into
either either change both the buttons and and the cover or just the cover i'm not sure which which is easier so
hmm
um anyway yeah this is what we're gonna do afterwards
just lunch break and have more individual work after that so let's see what we let's see we
so you have to come up with a components concept yeah
i want some you should do some trend watching because even if we're if we're gonna do those covers and everything what people really want
yeah
that's what we need to know in this phase because that's gonna be the essential final design that we're gonna come up with
yeah
okay
um
yeah i think user interface is fairly obvious
i mean it should be very intuitive s yeah it should speak for itself
pretty straightforward
uh for example i bought a remote control last week with a new t. v.
it was it l it's like all buttons and you have no idea what it does at first and i'm total t. v. new anyway
so i think it should be have less or l very little buttons and maybe a second second level menu for the advanced things
or maybe just stick 'em under a menu like you said the um the sound options and the surround and whatever they're more complicated
just stick 'em under one menu and uh give it a just put it in in s in a software piece
you can menu and you can uh select everything you want to to set on your t. v.
mm
is it techni technically possible to uh send a signal to a television and then pops up a menu
yeah
because we're working with different types of television so we're going to work with that
that is true
i don't think so
no that's true
no i don't think so
because the television needs to respond to the signal and if it doesn't know how it's exactly that's not possible
yeah that's true
it's an in built menu isn't it
yes
so basically we
i'm not sure if it's impossible but uh there's a chance it's not so
or we could use a double sided for less used functions you
a double sided remote control
yeah with the cover
i don't think that's useful
i it's basically an idea to overcome these issues because
yeah but then you're gonna have a lot of wasted buttons
for example you have a sony t. v. and the half of the buttons won't function if you have a for a sony that won't for a philips t. v.
hmm
no but basic functions but functions which are not frequently used
yeah
because if we use a universal remote control we're going to have to have most buttons on it so
i don't think we should yeah for exam
mm yeah
i'm not s yeah
for ex you have to make it a little decision between the part if you want a universal remote control that it should do what people usually do with their t. v. s
not not the very complicated settings that you can usually do that with uh either a old old remote control if they really hate that thing but
mm
mm
but that might be broken
you can't you cannot take into consideration all the different brands of t. v. s
i think there's i think there is a standard for example between uh because usually the the menu is the menu button is is usable between different brands
hmm
hmm
especially the big ones the big brands so
hmm
'cause everybody i have a universal remote control and it can use the menu button
hmm
so i think i'm not sure if you can put some research into that if it's possible
uh i think just a b and the navigation is very basic it's usually the same thing
mm okay
mm
but i think there must be a way uh to invoke the more complicated functions of a television
for instance if your old remote control is broken and you buy ours
then uh you should be able to get everything out of the television that's in it
yeah
yeah that's true
yeah
yeah
because otherwise you'll lose functions by buying our
i think so uh we need to put some research into that if if we can open the menu i think it's possible just the way how to
yeah
okay i thi i think so too
yeah yeah
yeah then then you could do everything i suppose because usually the t. v. s have tha that inside in this other little piece of software so it's okay
and i think that our r remote control should not look like uh any other
for instance uh sony makes all their remote controls exactly the same for all their devices
mm-hmm
and you always grab the wrong one because formatting of the buttons is exactly the same only the labels are different
yeah
yeah i think it should be a little distinct from everything else because it's either it's both mayb maybe the shape can be a little different
we should not do that
exactly
yeah
yeah i have some ideas
i have some ideas
maybe it's a little more curves or whatever
um yeah
mm that's your uh division
and uh with different colours uh
so um
i'll put some on paper and present them next time uh the ideas that i have
yeah this
not sure what because we have forty minutes i'm not sure how much time we have left for the meeting anyway so
okay
i heard a beep go
yeah but it wasn't me it was him closing something
yeah
so anyway yeah we could do some i do some work now on on the design for example
i mean what do you want do you want but
yeah but we like some some curves or
yeah may maybe something like this
but though smooth inside
so you have the transmitter here for example
yeah
let's see that you what would be handy
uh
i think that the the buttons should be the channel buttons should be uh on their own
and a light uh
let's see one two god damn it
oh we get the general ideas yes
yeah okay
another one here
let's see what i think this should these are always on top of the of the control so they should be here
hmm
yeah and since you're holding it like this i suggest you put the channel up channel down and volume yeah yeah
think it's like this
volume
withi within the yeah just take it
so you have the up channel
the down channel the volume do we want that horizontal or vertical
do you take triangles or
uh it's it's fine i think
um i think it should be i think it maybe we should make 'em bigger or whatever
this is basically what people are accustomed to so
yeah
yeah but this is just a g general idea
oh d
yeah
uh maybe the menu button can go i in the middle
yeah in the middle
it's it's usually uh there but
whoa
mm
perhaps we should also make uh something like a flash on it if you if it's lost for people that are deaf
they they won't hear the the beep
yeah
yeah but for example if it's lost in your armchair we'll not see the flash
you won't be able to find it
yeah
and flash takes up a lot of batteries again
uh
yeah it's true but it's it's only has to do so when you press the button that it's lost
just
yeah
we could make a combination that it goes beep and that you that some light lights up
so
and l. e. d. uh on it
deaf people
yeah i thought about for deaf people for example so
we could do that
just a light on it or
uh let's see
so we have the basic channels we've got here uh the power button
oh yeah it's true
somewhere over here
um that thing should be central
very important
you shouldn't be you uh shouldn't press it by accident but it shouldn't be stacked away somewhere
oh that's
i usually
press it on top
it's
at least that's what i'm accustomed to
yeah
i have another idea i'm not sure if it's possible
yeah like that's gonna work
and
what would you like to
yeah i thought maybe we should move the buttons down and put it here for example to
but you r
and you are reading from the t you always read from the top to the the bottom of it
from top to bottom
yeah that's true you should i think the bu the power button should be on top 'cause it's the first thing you do turn it on
yeah so it's
mm
yeah
so power button on top
um
okay mute button
mute
is that somewhere here
do we hardly i think it should be at the bottom somewhere
is that used often
so i it's sorry
the mute button
mute
do people use that often
turn the sound off
no it's no
'cause uh i'm pretty much accustomed to it right over here at least in general but
uh
hmm
i don't think it's important but i think it i think it should be you c you could put it somewhere here
it's not that important no
or or with the volume selection
no because it yeah people are accustomed to that it's
around uh not uh not at top at the around the volume selection
can i have that
i don't know where exactly but
sure
that's j
take this out and here see
uh are we gonna take triangles anyway
i'm drawing triangles but
that's pretty much what people are accustomed to aren't they
yeah it's maybe a bigger lesser than thing
so anyway i think this is should be
the channels and or sh
wha
well i'm accustomed to the channels being on top
no
yeah
here okay
yeah me too
yeah that's better
okay should we chan okay this two channel
on the right
up and down
shall we uh also look if it's possible to make a rechargeable remote
that you don't have to buy new batteries if every
yeah
well for that is it's on one part it's um it's a good thing to recharge it
maybe it's more ex expensive
mm yeah
maybe we should what what could be possible is one with rechargeable batteries for example
uh
you have just put penlite batteries that are rechargeable because it's an it's it's it's very annoying
but that's already possible
but isn't that expensive in the entire package
yeah
i'm not sure y i'm not sure it's if it's expensive but just take a look at it because it might be a very good idea
because if it's it's uh useful to have it rechargeable but at the same time
yes
if you don't want recha if you forgot to recharge it and you wanna watch t. v. now
yes
you wanna be able to put different batteries in it use it now and not in half an hour
okay
uh you could make a device but i'm not sure how that uh is possible with the costs that you can put in normal batteries
how about
rechargeable but it you're the remote also can act as a recharger
i think i have a nice idea
so then you can choose you have every decision
know what i mean
not exactly uh
you can uh put in normal penlites rechargeable penlites but they can also be recharged with the remote with a wire
hmm
yeah yeah
i think it's uh it's a pretty good idea to have uh like sort of a maybe a base station that you put on the t. v.
so but
yeah that's g
could be flat you could insert your uh remote into it
but i think that will cost a lot
uh a normal wire would be better
i'm not sure
like a like a p. d. a. a hand held
a what
you can uh just put it in the electricity and it charges itself you don't need basic station
well
we were talking about the fact that we wanted to insert either a beep or a flash into the thing with a little separate signal or so you could put that on a t. v. for example
yes
that is possible that's true
it could be very flat could be very small
but
it's a very small yeah i'm drawing it big now but so you can put your remote on flat for example
which
mm
yeah
and at the backside of remote just just just a little hole
yeah
for example um you just put it down it recharges for example
yeah
i don't think it's very expensive
but again isn't that too expensive
yeah
'cause that means that we have to implement rechargeable batteries a docking station
i'm not sure if it costs a lot that that's what he r
mm
that's that you that's what you buy yourself
yes
i'm going to try to find that out
i'm not sure if there's information available on this but
it's just an idea we have to find out if it's possible
but
and do people actually want that
yeah they want to pay for it
to pay extra they want to pay for rechargeable
do they want but they want a rechargeable one
yeah
i'm not sure you should find out if it's if rechargeable is important
th uh there was not a el ask esque
hmm
yeah
these are uh comfort issues
but
so i think people will pay they wanted to pay for comfort
well this is comfort
they want to pay for comfort
we just assu we we could either make a separate station which just sends a signal to the remote control to either beep or flash to find it
but f hmm
yes
um and
yeah we have to either that or make it integrated with a with a docking station
hmm
yeah
exactly
i think this is a brilliant product
i would buy it myself
i think it would be good actually
i like the beep part anyway
uh
so um let's go through the
i like the covers
that's a brilliant idea
can can we save this or
i never thought
covers is covers is good
yeah it's oh we can save this
up and saved
we even saved the ant
um
okay
so what we have is you have i think you have to do a lot of work on if it's possible for the cost
i hope if i have information about that i'm gonna
maybe yeah or maybe you can find out i what people are willing to pay
yeah
yeah
we are going for twenty five euros sales price but just try to find out what they're willing to pay for it
yeah okay
yeah yeah yeah
because if they're willing to pay more
we could lose a little profit and maybe attract more customers uh we just have to see what it looks like
mm
yeah
yeah
i would like to make a decision
what it costs and what kind of materials that we can uh choose what we want in it and exactly i need it
yeah if you have some financial information that that'd be nice so
hmm
could you post some other essentials of what people want so that i can work with some buttons where to put it
yeah
you seem to have information on that i'd like to uh
see some of it
was it not possible to uh send emails around the office
no it wasn't wasn't allo it was possible not allowed so
no it's not
not
no
so that's um why i'm not sure that you're allowed to share documents on the on the draft
yeah
my computer crashed so uh
yeah okay
i don't care
i lost my uh presentation but
i haven't heard any complaints yet so
oh your computer
okay
um
i have the uh
well i have your powerpoint presentation i can get some inf information out of that
yeah but i
here i have the the s the homepage of uh our
let's see
internet and here is my
yeah the oh they inc uh they include the new one
or just for you
oh where would we
here is my marketing report maybe you ca you can look at uh that and
oh no i didn't have that
where would we want the uh teletext button
ah yeah
because we decided that it's n not that important
and one
all it tells just let's make make a new tick the new one
do we put it somewhere over here
um other side
yeah let's increase it a little because
and uh wha what people want
or maybe this is something for the next meeting i can draw out some ideas
i've uh
yeah draw us up some some designs of of possible just keep in mind that the important buttons should be on top and either big
i have another thing uh
yeah
so the more less important
well we have decided more or less the basic structure
more or less
i can put the other buttons in
just play a little with this put l shift a little up or down and we'll see what looks best
yeah
what uh what did you wanna say
or just po post your designs from time to time on the product share
yeah
um
yeah
uh what i al already said is the the uh the remote controls are always lost
maybe another idea uh
but it it's also for people they want to learn it fast not uh they want to
mm
mm
yeah so we don't want we want very little buttons just the buttons you use a lot
no
mm
it's yeah it's easy to learn wi and uh
yes but it should cover all the functions so possibly just an idea that popped in
well what we had function that what people do so
um
people change channels people they change the volume and they they change channel they turn t. v. off and on for example
that's the basic fu that's what you do i'm not sure who present that again
but those are the basic function that people use it for so those should be very well represented
yeah but we could go a step further because some t. v. s have the uh possibility to adjust brightness that kind of menus
and
the
if
that's true but that's what we stick under the menu button
everything is you say in every t. v. that's configured under the menu
yes but it
but that's the question is it
because we're making
um
because it needs to be configured in the television under the menu
yeah but
if it isn't then we cannot reach it
we need to adjust to the technology
but i think most modern t. v. s have it in their menu
i think so too
i think so too
true
uh isn't there a possibility to do research on that so we know that for sure
if you rule out functions then uh and that gets known then people are not gonna buy it
then the consumer bond or something says uh you cannot do this and that with it
no i thi
if um
that's a bad bad com commercial for okay
uh we'll we'll see what we can come up with
another thing i want to say is that uh we are looking at the market for the age uh younger than forty
under forty
yeah
that's true
um on my report i didn't uh ish i didn't show it in my uh presentation because my computer crashed
mm-hmm
yeah yeah
um they want to pay for an l. c. d. screen and speech recognition
hmm
hmm
the want to pay for oh
so
did they really said it like that
i yeah
those two things
yeah and
do they realise how much that costs
uh shall we
that's almost undoable
yeah
oh we're not going to be able to sell it for twenty five then with an l. c. d. screen
younger age sixteen and forty five
uh but
that's all here here it says
no that's that's
even if i if we have this lost unit then we cannot do it for that price
yeah age sixteen forty fi interest in main features more critical
if if they
okay so we're not focusing on this
um
all the interest in features not really the l. c. oh here
would you pay for uh speech recognition in a remote control
hmm okay
yeah that's true
so uh
we can
speech recognition is quite
we can look at the possibilities for an uh l. c. d. and uh i dunno
mm
yeah just look at the possibilities then because if apparently it's what people want
yeah
hmm
how much it will cost and
it's supposed to be a luxurious remote maybe it's not even that expensive
uh
or find a compromise maybe just a black and white or for some extra information on it on your programmes
uh i
um
well i doubt it but
but i really need finance information
me too
i mean we all do
it will come uh
we all do
right
i think it's something we should put into consideration
apparently it's what people want so
mm
we should see if what it costs if it's possible
uh
yeah
yeah
yeah we should do a little thing about design because it looks boring really to me
even if you put it even if you put a different cover on it it looks still looks boring so
different colours maybe
hmm
and the design it should differ
but all
this is philips huh
philips has this
i have no clue
well i had basically
i just drew something what which would fit into your hand easily
okay
hmm
uh
something like this
to make it kind of futuristic
mm
oh i realise if we make it small then it needs to be a little thicker because i need to put all the electronics in it
i think it's a very
sorry
if we make it s uh smaller uh less wide
yeah
then we need to m make it a little thicker because i have to put all the electronics in it
okay
mm-hmm
yeah but you have to j just keep in mind it shouldn't be too heavy
okay
i mean we can stick it in in there i think
no
huh even if in the worst case we can even could you give me the pen back
so what kind of
yeah sure
so let's say that people would want an l. c. d. thing
let's take take the basic design again what we oh crap uh came up with
i'll just make it a little bigger now
so a transmitter here
anyway
we could let's say we have an l. c. d. screen people want an l. c. d. screen
so then we should probably put it here
it doesn't have to be really big but just just have to be has to be there
hmm
think it's a good place people don't
if you're reading from top to bottom i think it's better to put it uh at the top
no
it's not that uh it's not the most important function it's just an extra thing
me too
it's j
ah but
it just you press the buttons on top because your finger is on top
uh
but i if you if you are going to uh put the l. c. d. on it
i think it's very important to use it uh because it's use it uh
how can you use an l. c. d. screen
but nee the function of it
so you can use it maximum because uh it's a lot it costs a lot
so
yeah but why i i'm not sure
now it's pretty much tucked away in your hand
uh if you t if you press a button you can see it ri i'm not sure wha i'm trying to imagine myself what it would look like
hmm
no
m i personally would prefer it on the top
i'm
you would prefer it n okay
yeah
huh
so we have three people saying it should be on top
okay but then you would would s have to stack away your buttons somewhere else
but it
hmm
anyways
it's expensive to build it so
mm
uh this looks a little
you must use the maximum of it
i'm still not convinced of the
about the l. c. d. s thing
yeah
hmm
well if it if it's if it's possible wi if it's not too expensive we should include it because it's it's cool
they want it uh
we should just try to make that if it's possible
if it is possible we should really do it but we need that information
huh
uh
also keep in mind again the l. c. d. screen is very flat but it needs transistors resistors i don't know what more and that needs space
but uh
so i have to look if that's possible
yeah i know uh
but if we
so basically can i what we have to decide now is uh what goes on top
uh we have green now uh
do we put the volume control and the channel control here or do we put it on he would we like to press it in the middle
in middle of it
or maybe we should m we could uh draw draw something a bit that has it on on on the bottom
in the middle
maybe in a circle for example like we like in this example
i think this is not good but for we could make circular buttons for example
hmm
for up and down ma make it a circle on it because it
yes but we do agree that we keep this at the centre because it's basically the most important function
yeah
i think the channel button should be in the centre
it's the most import yeah
channel button should be st stick together for example here in this section
because it's uh
well that would make them quite small
we're not sure about the size anyway just a general design
so maybe you'd put them here
you can make it as big as you want
for example if you take uh
yes but a big remote control probably not something which people would like
hmm
no let's see
for example just
if we have a a space issue we can also lose one battery
it is rechargeable so we can stick with one instead of two
yeah
that might be an option
i don't think if we if we even use an l. c. d. screen we need to definitely
yeah but if we need two batteries and an l. c. d. screen that means a lot of space that we need
yeah but we have to see what the si what the size is
but it has to be a little bit heavier
okay
the l. c. d. doesn't have to nee doesn't need to be very big
no but the things behind it
space
mm let's see
like a process uh
finish meeting now
it's on your computer
finish meeting now
okay we will
so would we like this or would we like the
so either
we either we have to decide what what people want
i like this one more
either this one this this could be the luxurious one
so we have channel buttons here
i'm just drawing something uh
uh
i think this would this would look cool
you could have it for example
small buttons here for some extra functions so if your basic function's here we should like we decided before programmes up and down
uh
mm
and volume here
let's see what we have here
or
and uh what about speech recognition uh
well you can just no i'm not sure if we can do that but we could put a microphone in here for example
yeah yeah but or or an l. c. d. or an uh speech
mm
i think it's l. c. d. is better now
just to do research into both w what it costs and what it takes for space
yeah
i'll try to
yeah
but let's cut the meeting for now yes
one more uh thing i'd like to say uh let's give this uh a name
and not like some vague serial number that no one understands like with cars
okay
yeah okay yeah that's yeah that's okay
shall we all try uh to think about a name
so i think of a name
yeah let's think of a name okay
uh okay
oh good
okay at anyways the the minutes will be on the on the web shortly so there we go uh
so
yes go and finish up and i'll see you at lunch
yeah
good luck
yeah to all
same
yeah
yeah i've do we uh save the
did you manage
yeah sh not quite
okay
you will see uh
ah
hello
hello
so are you d what were j you guys discussing
no just uh ask if if he could manage
woah
yeah
okay
did you find anything new
mm uh nothing special
uh
mm-hmm
i have a lot of new information
yeah the for uh the trendy uh stuff
great great
a little bit
come on
i uh now will show it
hey everything alright
well i had just a little bit of time so i hope it's something uh we can work with
did you manage
okay
okay
what's uh here
but
yeah i had the same
it just uh
do you have a lot of new information
shuts itself down and
hmm
do you have a lot of new information
well i heard that there was a new uh component speech recognition component
oh
which was pretty much up to standard so we might use that i put that in my drawing but again i didn't not have that much time
that's true
and there we are
huh
so
alright
i have a lot of new information
what the f oh yeah uh
i have a complete list of uh everything that we can use all the components that all av available
it doesn't do what i want it
okay that's just super
i have no i still don't have any finance information but at least we have a lot more to go on now
let me just
uh
okay fine that's too bad
you need to start it up first
yeah i have to start our
okay
'kay
okay go again
well second phase conceptual design
it's fine everybody knows what we're talking about
so take you past the minutes of last meeting again
yep
again you get your three presentate to see what you came up with
so too bad we don't have any finance information apparently
so that's too bad
so then we'll just have to d uh have to go on you know
the information that we have to make the make final decisions on uh on a conceptual design
so
here we go
anyway last w last w what discussed last time you all remember that that we have to keep the electronics size in mind
same goes for you
we have to have an easy design with big buttons which are durable and there are people actually spen willing to spend money to do to get more features and uh among those features l. c. d. screen and voice recognition are very popular
so we have to make a move on that area i guess
s especially s when when the new uh component is applicable in our uh product we'll be fine
anyways well teletext wasn't important and that's what i took
and the consumer yeah we aim for young consumers so that's fine
and well actually we yeah we did need some more data on finances but w yeah we still don't have that apparently
mm uh-huh
that's too bad
yeah we need to im de we are going to implement the beep and the flash thing to recover your remote
so one of these interchangeable covers apparently which will make it a more fashionable product
so anyway
guess we'll have to do this after the after the you give your presentations
so i'll just close this one now and let's uh let's see
okay what t
i bet
we have a lot to tell
you had a lot to go on
so uh how about you go first
yep that's right
okay yeah
oh okay
let's see where my
presentation is
okay um this i mentioned before
every feature for our remote control needs to have their own operating electronic devices
we need to take care of that
then warning uh there has to be a chip in our remote control
and the chip requirements uh needed for a normal button uh is just a simple chip uh scroll wheel and l. c. d. is an advanced
of course this is more expensive than this
so we have to decide on that in a minute
okay
the available uh components for energy are we have a basic battery a hand an uh dynamo like in uh old torches
we have a kin uh kinetic provision then you have to shake the remote control to get the energy
and we have solar cells
i suggest that we uh decide on that one uh immediately
then i have all lists
so
my personal uh fav favourite is the kinetic provision because uh i ha
um
does it provide enough energy
i think so yes
also if if we were choose the the l. c. d. option would it give enough energy okay that's the just assume it takes
yes
yes
because i had the information uh you take uh the remote control you pick it up at least two times a day
so then it's already shaken and gives energy
well i'm not sure if it's shaken enough because
is that enough
because i don't really see people shaking their remote control before using it
or
no i don't think so because uh watches can go on kinetic energy because they move all the time
think
but i'm sure t i mean remotes lie still i think like ninety nine percent of the time
hmm
hmm
so i don't think that's a really good the other alternative were solar cells
i don't think that's applicable because
other options are solar cells hand dynamo and basic battery
no
i thin why why shouldn't we take a basic battery
and what does the hand dynamo oh sorry
yeah
a rechargeable maybe
only basic battery
okay but i think this is not a r
why not
re rechargeable basi
i mean everybody everybody knows how to use that
it's it's common
so and it's available everywhere
yeah
so why sh mm i think better
yeah but i think this rules out our unit our rechargeable unit
yeah
this is really a really basic battery a normal battery
yeah but it's
yeah uh it wasn't it wasn't in the options a rechargeable m module actually
oh
huh
okay that's uh
okay
okay yeah b you c of course you could place re re chargeable batteries
yep
basic
but that's up to the consumer himself
so
okay but then we don't offer a re chargement function
that's what it says
well mm it's not in the list
so we cannot choose from it
so
exactly
alright
okay will just take regular batteries
right
yep
okay
next one is curving
uh we can make a model that has one curve two or three
and uh uh th uh the shape
curves being
of course uh the more curves the more expensive
okay
of the remote control itself okay
exactly
but
yes
but
it dep
i was thinking along the line of one curve
i'll show that in my design
but
hmm
okay we'll get back on that later
so we'll get back to that
yeah
just
hmm
i think one curve is uh fine
yeah
but what were the implications if you if put more curves it it's gets more expensive
depends on the user
more expensive
okay so i think with with the extras that we had there it's two curves i suppose
more difficult to make
exactly
okay
and i believe even that the r the number of options we have on putting things in it uh goes down with exactly
also decreases okay
material
i have to offer a plastic rubber wood or titanium
uh if we choose plastic we cannot choose solar cells for energy
if we choose titanium uh we cannot use more than one curve
okay
but we don't have that so fast
more than one curve uh yeah okay
okay i t i'd go for plastic because i have a couple of curves in my design
we'll just go uh
'cause it yeah i'm not sure
mm
yeah
mm
well g let's just get back to that
we'll discuss that later
okay we have so i think we can rule out um i'm not sure we can rule anything out
yeah
okay
we'll do that when y when you get your design
no
but i think wood is not an option either
no wood's not an option
no wood i wood's not an option
no
well it it's stylish but we can yeah but you can change your covers anyway
okay
hmm
no
okay
my personal thought was uh rubber because i had an email i believe it was from you uh f against falling
yeah is it keep in mind that it it's it's uh it fal uh remote controls fall a lot on the ground
so you don't want it to break
so either have rubber edges or a rubber remote control is very durable
hmm
okay
but continue
uh
yeah but it doesn't have to be unbreakable because we do need to keep selling these thing
no
don't have to be un breakable it's p it's a it's not supposed to ju yeah break after one use
mm
okay well that that's definitely true
yeah
i mean it they they fall a lot
so
mm
i think we have to decide on this anyway
uh because if we make removeable covers it has to be one of those mat materials
we have no more than this
so
because it well ru will rubber actually protect the remote control itself
because it
well you have for if you if for example if you take hard plastic
if it falls it might crack
and rubber uh kind of softens the fall
yeah but then you buy a new cover
but rubber
i'm not sure if it's the it's the entire cover you change
uh it's could be
mm-hmm
are are we focussi focussing on on the
you know what th we're focusing very much on the covers now
i think it's just w now we're going for the basic design
but
if we wanna expand our options f be fashionable then we can get changeable covers
but i think the basic thing let's just rule out wood for now and continue
but
mm-hmm
okay
not that but are we focussing on the uh younger people or the elder people
we're definitely focussing on the younger people 'cause that was our main goal
younger okay
yeah that's okay
nah that's
alright
then i proceed but i need to know after this meeting
so interface uh i have four things to offer pu uh normal push buttons of course
okay okay we will
okay
um uh we have a lot of expertise on that one
we have a large history our company on push buttons
mm-hmm
scroll wheels uh those can be pushed as well although that is more expensive
um liquid crystal colour display and um
what is this
okay and if we use rubber i already mentioned that we can only use rubber buttons
so rubber can only match with rubber
mm-hmm
which one of those are we gonna use
push buttons that's b uh i think basic
evident
yeah o of course we're gonna use
but i didn't i didn't go on the thought of a scroll wheel actually
yeah of cour
huh
but
i'm still deciding on what what what could you use it for
no
maybe for volume control
i think the channels
channel i think that would be annoying because it might accidentally scroll onto another channel
oh
yeah
i think a push button for channel would be better
i mean it for volume control it's it's a smoother motion you can just increase or decrease
huh
huh
but not sure
hmm
yeah but there is a is it really necessary 'cause a normal push button can do that job
for channels will be good
but
i don't think so
i haven't i haven't taken it into consideration
huh
oh
but th the younger people my investigation turns out that the younger people want a little bit uh material that that is uh spongy and uh
ah so but it looks cool
i don't think we really need one
mm no
oh
ah
flashy and yeah
i think would be cool scroll wheel
so
it's not that much uh if we take a normal scroll wheel without the pushing then it's not expensive
a sc
we can do that
but why do we need it
yeah but why would we use it
think
ah we don't need it but it's uh it's design a design thing
yeah
if we don't need it
why put it in your why put it in your in your if it's if it's not something people are looking for or is useful
yeah you get
no
i think they are looking for that
of course we have uh a young target group
are they
so they might find that attractive in a remote con
scroll wheel
yeah but if it's if it's not useful i don't think it i don't think it gives an extra function to the remote
uh i don't know
yeah that's it
anyway
okay
so push buttons we will use
uh l. c. d. screen
perhaps
i have t i have two different
is that s
what you what what'd you get on the l. c. d. screen
yeah
is it expensive
does it
uh i only know that if we are using that we need ano uh an advanced chip in it
and that is more expensive
and how much more expensive is that
i have no idea
or
i have no absolute numbers
no absolute numbers but it's just more expensive and takes more room i suppose in your in your design
okay
i only have
yeah but i don't think room is really an issue
don't think it's an issue okay
oh let's go for let's say because it is uh very hot in n our target group i think
we should take it take it t to consideration to build an l. c. d. screen in it
i have two designs one including uh an l. c. d. screen wh which is basically the deluxe edition
for the future
okay
yeah
and then i also have a standard edition which wi we can also choose to develop too
which basically has the same functionality but lacks the l. c. d. screen
yep
exactly
okay
but we'll
we'll pick a we'll pick from uh we'll just combine everything later
mm-hmm
okay
electronics uh the first one is the chip
uh that's no longer an option it has to be an advanced one now
'cause we have the l. c. d. screen
yep
then we have an infrared sender i think that's basic we cannot do without
basically it
yep
otherwise it's not s a remote control
mm-hmm
and we have the sample sensor and speaker the voice recognition thing
are we gonna do that or not
once again i was would ask you if it's expensive but apparently you don't have any data
oh i got
i only have uh uh relative information
so
well what d what was exact what you got on the on the new component
i got an email that it's relatively small
that's small
so we can implement it
yes let me just
so why why if it's small and we can imp why shouldn't we
get back
oh how did you
and there's um get your mar marketing report
that goes also for the scroll wheel by the way
what was uh the last number of how many people were interested in voice recognition
um uh
although it's hard for different countries of course
the most of them um
but you have to programme it yourself i suppose with your own voice
um uh more than uh sixty percent
more than sixty percent of the people would like voice recognition
yeah
mean of uh seventy percent i think
hmm
uh i'm i have to look it up
if it's small if it's fits if if people like it why not
yeah
hmm
but don't we have any w uh information about scroll wheel
so
scroll wheel
if people would like that
no
no only
that's strange because that's the same story
it's it's not necessary like an l. c. d. but it's just it adds something to the design
ah
i don't know
yeah but we got some data on people that actually are int are interested in that and i don't think a scroll wheel offers new functionality
hmm
on the most spee
whereas speech recognition and l. c. d. screen do offer new functionality in your product
no
but
oh that's r
but i think uh we now already have to uh implement uh an advanced chip
uh i think so because if i think we're specially w if you're going maybe uh if you have the two editions you wanna wanna give out
so it's m
yeah for the future
probably you have one with uh with speech recognition and
well they b they basically can have speech recognition
i mainly focused on the l. c. d. uh aspect
um
yeah hold on a minute
were were you we're finished
or
no but that's that's okay
oh
because if there's something that
'cause you wanted to see them right
there is still time
'cause have did you have all the materials
or everything that you desc
yes this was uh the last m. s.
i have a clear picture
okay so uh just just go for design for now
just m have a seat for a second
uh
we'll combine everything after this
so this is basically the deluxe edition
why is it s why is it squared
i j
why is it square
why did you pick square
or uh not square but why is it yeah sharp corners
it 'cause it's designy
it's basically it has some futuristic
potentially yeah
yeah
i don't really know
but i just thought that uh in normal remote controls you have like smooth curves and this and that
people
looks like a star trek phaser
and this is something new this is something different something fresh
it's true
and basically what you can see here is that it has a little yeah let's say gap which you can put your finger in
ri
yeah
or okay so just yeah you can rest it on your finger
so only r right handed
so you can you can hold it really comfortable that's basically the idea
okay
mm-hmm
but it but it's only right handed then
not for the left
or left hand
no it just uh it's a curve inside a thing
or
i doesn't really matter
hmm
so
as you can see this is the remote control
where
where
it's on the back
oh in the back okay
uh you can't really see it that well but this is the l. c. d. screen
oh yeah yeah
okay
so just imagine it goes that way
yeah i think it's okay
oh yeah yeah
then you can see you can hold it in your left or in your right hand
okay
yeah
yeah yeah
and i also made a quick image 'cause i did not have that much time
yeah
i thought it
of the standard edition
which has basically the keys are pretty much the same
keys are probably the n the number keys i suppose
yeah
i had to do this really fast
so excuse me for the uh inconvenience here but as you can see the keys moved
okay
well you can work on the actual concept or actual design later with him
yeah
so these are basically the two types we have
but
so if we were to select the l. c. d. screen the transmitter here you can see the light i
well i think what you have to keep in mind is that um you're moving the the the number keys from the top
uh in the the simple design you have them at a top and the uh complex design you have them at the bottom
so it would that would give us a totally different design
so which actually making a whole different product instead of two different models
i think it would be very expensive to produce two whole different products
well we can shift that
so
but normally as you can see there we put the uh number buttons right on top
whereas because we had the l. c. d. screen here we had to move them downward so what you could say is that
yeah uh or for example why did you pick the mm the numbers uh all the way below and the and the channels and volume control
because these are basically the functions you use the most
well it it's yeah
so if you hold it in your hand like this you put your finger in the gap this is the m most easy part
okay
bit
hmm i agree
for zapping cau because people are zapping most of the time
that's fine
yeah
that's fine
just as long as you tak took it into consideration what people would prefer
uh okay if you all agree i'm fine with it
hmm
but
yeah
okay
so that's pretty much ha which i had in mind
as you can see here this can be spaced for extra keys which is the design thingys
okay
no it maybe it's better to look uh what the people want
yeah i think we'll
so i can uh show my uh investigation
i think we're going towards the deluxe edition anyway because that seems to be what the people want
yeah maybe it's better
but let's see what's what they want now
yeah
especially for young people
mm-hmm
um where is that
where is th
that's mine
oh
uh
no you should send it to the f to the folder first
yeah
mm i forgot that
okay um let's just assume we go to forty one
okay now it must be there
yeah here it is
oh yeah
okay uh the investigation turns out that the most appear uh people want um um uh look and feel likes is uh uh the s the same as before
but it must be w a little bit fancier than uh the the look of it
um the second important thing is um the it must be uh technol technological uh innova vative
so that's the l. c. d. screen is perfect i think and not uh
speech recognition
yeah tha that's uh very important
and a third thing is
um yeah it's uh should be easy to use so not not too much bu buttons and uh channel selection
i think that's uh what you showed is uh perfect
and what the pe young people want is uh in paris and and in milan uh it showed out that the fruit and vegetables are uh are trendy
mm-hmm
th they you s you see it in the clothes and everything
and um the contrast uh of it it must uh the the buttons must a little bit spongy material
so uh rubber i think uh th that's the best
hmm
no
mm-hmm
then rubber would be the best as a material indeed
yeah uh i agree
no
i think so
so we are uh we were focussing uh on the younger people
if that is the uh
okay agreement
okay
so the elder yeah they wanted a little bit of wood in it and uh that's uh th that's not uh important now
okay so we're definitely going for rubber
it could be a c it could be a cover
yeah
but it's not
yeah but
our focus is the young audience
let's just go
so let's stick to that
yeah
uh-huh
'cause uh n i i i i thought uh it makes a young uh classic remote with uh
nah i think we're in this case you're losing the the focus on the young group because we're that's what we're focussing on
yeah that's why i i d uh
so i think the spongy feel gives us rubber
decided
mm-hmm
with a fruit uh
yeah w th apparently
cover ov or something like that
yeah apparently yeah maybe also yeah i tend to disagree with with uh with a sharp form
uh
i suppose it basi if you're uh saying fruits and vegetables maybe it's supposed to be a little little more round
yeah in in form of an uh vegetable or an uh fruit maybe
yeah for exa maybe like uh like a pear or something
yeah but that's just more a se a seasonal a trend thing
and
oh where is your
that's true
that's what we're doing
the idea now is is is that you can uh put a cover on it for example with fruit like a shape or whatever
a trendy
mm
hmm
i think shape is is important because they s they really extend
but not 'cause a n next year it will it'll be something completely different
here he here you can put a
hmm
oh that's true
and then you have your apple shaped remote control which is not trendy anymore
so i think that's more something you can focus
yeah but now you have your your like your star trek phaser thing shaped control
so i i th the edges are really really sharp
well you can s
uh maybe it
i'm uh not su
what you can do is smooth the edges indeed
but that will bring extra c expenses
mm-hmm
or maybe just make it make it up into into a low a smooth curve instead of just less sharp twist on the outside
but
yeah
all uh veg uh fruit and vegetables are round
so it's better
mm-hmm
i think i think there needs to be a little i think it's too too sharp
the edges are too sharp
the bottom is fine of course if it's square
yeah
but maybe just th make uh the top a little round it off on the sides
so i mean y
but i think according to my information this would be two curves
that would be two curves
two
we have one left and one right and that disables what was it again
but it
it's some it's something that we cannot do then
one cur you could also make the curve go through of course
but that would make make the top round
well we've got we've got like one curve here
okay that's not a problem
for the gap
that's only for the titanium
we don't have
but it's that that's for the comfort
and we could have one here
it's it's not for the trendy thing of it
no no no no no
what i'm just 'cause you mentioned that more curves the more expensive so i'm just taking that into account
yeah
yes
okay yeah
but let's see titanium would give us only one curve
then w yeah but we don't have that
so but we're not d we're not using titanium
so we have
so the no
we have no
well we picked rubber right
right we did
so
but they uh
we m
so basically what we can do is m make these edges a little bit less sharp
just doodle something on the board on the left
form
but the problem then is that it will start to resemble m the remote controls as we have them today
we were looking at something fresh something trendy
well actually we're setting ourselves apart from by technology alone actually
so that let's see what you're doing
they th these wha are what they call the curves
this side this side this is how they count
oh okay
okay
i don't think like that
not not really the curves on the on the side of the remote
no no
this is what they uh what they mean
okay that's not really a good
okay so that's basically silly
okay now i uh of course now i understand why they have more uh like um
why the curves
um decrease the the um the size the electronics that can be inside
so okay
i don't think the outside would be called as a curve really
yeah
it's like this
i think it's for all the basic well looking from the side anyway
well if you see what i have to come up with some designs fast anyway
so
but you can make uh if you want to use a fruit in uh in uh
hmm
okay
but isn't the f the fruit like a cover thing because we
uh
well you shouldn't focus on the mostly on the covers because lot of things we came up with
hey you
shouldn't be too really too much shouldn't be too focussed on the covers because it's kind of an idea of our own
you can make it like
hmm
no but
like this
but we're not sure if we can actually make that
but if we put that directly into the design we limit ourselves extremely
because it that's just for one seasonal trend
that's the one thing i'm also afraid of with this one because it the edges are really um they might stick out on the on the side for example
well
oh
as a example
hmm
but
if you have a basic design a little m a little smaller on the on the s on the edges
i d
you could put more covers on it y one one with square or um sharp corners if you want to
okay so that's well that's probabl
so m just round it off a little i guess because so we have more options i suppose
hmm
you'd just like it to go a little bit more like this
i think so because it looks leaner and we should just go with that
okay
anyway you have all the time in the world to make to make the final design in a minute with him
hmm
so so we decided on what what did you guys wanna know again because this is um anyway i'll fire up my thing
so so we come to a decision
did you present e everything you wanted to
yep
okay
so i can uh qui oh
uh what the
i can quickly make a conclusion
of what we have decided so far
uh we still need to decide on a couple of things you you needed to know
ah
yeah
okay anyway
uh energy we choose regular regular batteries
yeah
the chip is advanced because we have the advanced features
the case it will be the material will be rubber suppose
wouldn't the b the design we talked about
uh user interface type
well i think we took all the components separately what we want
um let's see um supplements
i'm not sure what they mean by that
anyway um apparently you guys you should work together on the final design both on internal and external design
so
yeah you should you should probably find out how the product will fall into the market
how uh what's gonna happen with the final design as we have it now
yeah
so yeah of course you've got your specific instruction as usual
yeah
so wanna spend some more um i think we're in a pretty much in agreement actually which is good
hmm
hmm
so
are we all in agreement about the well the primary structure of the of my design
lef let's see where the pen go
except for the edges
here
like the keys there
yeah uh open your thing again
let's see what if you can come up with anything new
um i'll just do a next one
so what would give us your ne your design would be the lights would be on top right
uh one on each one on each side
yeah
to create a kind of disco effect when you
that was basically what w
is it is it the lights for for finding the finding remote or lights that it that
light for the finding of the remote
we can also use one light for
showing that the signal is being sent
but
yeah i think that should just be a simple led or something
like that that's not that important of course
it just like a matter of a a beep if you pre that you just know that that there's context
so i don't think that's super important
but
hmm
so we have the teletext we have here we have the mute
uh sh oh
l. c. d. screen
this is the on off button
and speech w recognition
are we
speech recognition i where did i imagine
we
i did that pretty much over here so that you could use it like this
little uh voice uh
record and a uh no
and speak to it
then you have the uh extra keys for teletext mute two buttons which can be pretty much anything or nothing
we can also just not use them
let's see i'll just make
main controls and a key pad
yeah
one light here
and just make it red now
but it could be any colour
so
will be fine
okay whatever
fine anyway
what do we have here
m i'll make it um are we gonna use square buttons or round ones actually
personally i would prefer round ones
me too
yeah but that would this was just in the design
form of fruit
it's better
because if you i had a square design
hmm
yeah for
so i had square buttons
okay
but in that case the round buttons would be more appropriate
okay i assume it for so we take a r take a round power button right here
whatever
uh back to black
uh not too big though
see this would be good
um let's see
are these for any extra controls
yeah
the left one is teletext and the right one is mute
okay
and these two buttons are or not necessary or
okay
if we go for for round buttons in general do we want to the menu key in the middle to be round
for example if you let's see put it this here
i think we'll go with the triangles that come on
yeah the triangles would be best indeed
triangles are good
yeah they're a little too big now
but
anyway okay
so do you want for example a
round button in the middle or square one
i personally think that a round b button looks bit silly but
hmm
i'm not sure uh i just just came up with it
yeah
this aligns nicely
so
okay
we'll just take the take the round button suppose
uh oh the square button sorry
does everybody agree on that
yep
i suppose so
i would prefer round
but doesn't matter doesn't matter
you prefer a round
okay
okay
that's not a big deal think
so there's our numbers
think we need an extra button here of course for yeah like you had for the
higher numbers
and you could include a button here for the mute i suppose
for something else just to
yeah you can
mirror mirror the effect with this
but it but it's not necessary becau
that's not necessary because it you can take this away but there it looks like there's a hole there just to mirror the effect
okay so we have a few
we could put our logo there
nah i think it it would be nice to put the logo here for example if you have some buttons here
we could put a logo here because it's very always in your field of vision
and what about oh
if you're watching it the l. c. d. screen blah blah
what about a button for your uh favourite channel
oh that could be that b
well we could we could include either here
uh yeah
with the extra controls
or here for example
uh
but you think here or here
well now it's getting a little bit too crowded up there
uh one one set
i know
so is your
yeah you have to put it up uh
so it can basically be the button down below or one of the four buttons up there
no we could put this one as favourite channel for exam
because
one of the four
uh it's better than i think
what are these for
one of the four is better i suppose
okay
it's a favourite channel
what
what
nee uh one of the four uh
because it's a little bit confusing to have twelve buttons down there because you're only accustomed to eleven i'd say
it's better th
you're accustomed to eleven
my uh okay have it your way
i mean think this looks rather like like there's something missing for example
oh we still need an okay button
i mean why wouldn't you include a 'cause there is a um a piece of electronics under there anyway
so why not give it a function
hmm
hmm
let's say i mean could be anything
well you could also shift the two buttons to be nicely aligned
but th
no i don't think because this is a zero
but you want zero to be mis aligned with the rest
yeah
anyway so this is the basic design we wanna have um on and off what are we missing
oh we're pretty much missing an okay button but we have a button up there which is still free
if it looks um
okay so we want the remote to be the s the side view actually what i'm gonna draw
so
so
um
probably think you want the curve to be here
so have your finger under here like this i suppose
yeah pretty much
okay
just gonna be sh
hmm
yeah
want this straight or what
let's keep it at this
so it would be like this
do we want something interesting with it or see
would give us a light here
maybe it's boring
you want it curved or what
maybe you want
well i think it looks better curved
should like this
but that's probably uh
will give us design problem because we have
mm
huh
it can be curved
why
it can be curved because that yeah it's a little bit more trendy to be curved
yes
it can be curved
okay
i think so
that's why i asked you
okay
so
i would curve the whole actually
hmm
i would curve the whole
like um like it hangs over your hand a little bit
oh crap
yeah
then it will bounce and you don't drop it so easily
yeah
oh
anyway so you want to a little more like this
yeah something like that yes
uh-huh
and just s s
yes exactly
stop the curve here or continue it
i think continue like that
yep
then there's also enough room for the electronics
so we have our l. c. d. screen
let's see
but it pretty much looks like a banana already
in
yeah
uh
yeah
let's make it yellow then
perfect
bana it's banana vision
uh
it's fruit
yeah it's perfect
yeah
so you have your l. c. d. screen right here suppose
um that would make
we use the colours now
but
um
maybe once we can make a special edition in according with chiquita
have ourselves sponsored
you got sponsor now you get a free one with every pack of chiquita
uh but it's a good trade off for them if they can have their logo on it
so it would give the buttons here
or they can design their own cover
mm-hmm
they might wanna be the first ones to uh
we could set up a a marketing uh agreement
i suppose i suppose we can put um let's see
yeah
um
oh perhaps they can use it
or give a special edition uh with with
uh i suppose we can put the batteries in here because it has the most space for example
won't that be a problem with the l. c. d. screen
i don't think so because it's the biggest part of the uh of the uh
mm
yeah but the l. c. d. screen probably needs quite the chip
let's
i think this is possible
i think it's possible
okay
i think it's the best place yeah you could also put 'em here
huh
but
it doesn't matter
you can actually uh place a chip for the l. c. d. screen and at the bottom and and wire it
doesn't matter
okay so we put the batteries here
okay that's not a problem
okay
okay
that's fine
yep
blah
i think we get the idea
um any other com what what are we missing here
something a speech recognition
um
where do we want the microphone for example to be
on the side or on the or for example on top
top
oh basically the idea that i had was it to be pretty much in combination with the transmitter
w
on there
like here
i think on top
to be
'cause you can talk to it like this
okay i w thought maybe it's either be here or because it's mi it might interfere with the transmitter i'm not sure
no
but
'cause transmitter would be here
well the email said it was a quite a small component
so i don't see that
why uh once again like you said the component can be somewhere at the bottom while we wire the microphone up there
anyway
um yeah it could be either be here or make a double microphone
mm-hmm
i wouldn't mind
it is i believe also able to talk
it's able to talk to you
it's a
i have a sample uh sample sensor and the speaker sensor
a speaker sensor
uh the speaker sensor we already have but s i don't know what they exactly mean by a sample sensor
could it talk back
like uh g uh give confirmation or something
i think it can
i think if you have a a speech recognition component then a s speaking component is not that hard to to put in either
well the
i think so it i think it could
yeah
mm-hmm
i mean it could be a all this stuff could be integrated into the l. c. d. screen which you could navigate with this i suppose
hmm
navigate through everything
hmm
hmm
if you have i think you sh i think the advanced options should be i think it sh the advanced option could also be integrated in the l. c. d. screen
yeah but do you actually need the remote talking back
but
mm-hmm
yeah
of course because you don't have to have a button for everything
you can just navigate through th m your menu that you have here for advanced options with this
hmm
hmm
think that would be fine
mm
so that's w m would be making use of the l. c. d. screen
hmm
mm
we already have a sound component by the way for the beep
so beep
beep
beep
beep
um so the flashing of the beep we have well anything
we could yeah but you could put a speaker or something on on the side for example
at the back yeah
hmm
like that
or at the side
for how do you draw that again
which is
uh whatever looks stupid
so what's basically edi the editi idea sorry now
i think this is pretty
we need to stay here and work out that
i'm not sure
i think you have to stay here because we are supposed to five minutes to finish the meeting
oh
i should be getting new information i guess
oh
like my the info that i got was that you're uh we're gonna work on our own because you're gonna do the market market uh analysing i'm supposed to do the little work on the year end report
yep
so the project report
okay
hmm
okay i think we're everybody satisfied with the with the current design we have
well i suppose we'll
yes
so we're s supposed to be rubber
ah that's fine
pretty much
i think well i think the the remote control is gonna be black because we we forgot to talk about i mean the the company colours are important apparently
round
wh
why
so we have the logo up there
but we have
any company logo
so are we gonna base colour is black
we have yes but and yellow
and yeah of course we could use yellow buttons or yellow navigation or whatever
i would change
i would take a yellow remote control
yellow but yellow control
it's
to have it flashy to have it it's for young people
yeah but when you use covers it basically easier to have a n have a neutral colour on the base
okay
need do be different
it's the colour of a
well don't don't stick yourself on the covers right now
but don't stick yourself on the cover because
hmm
no we're designing the remote control now but taking that into consideration it's better to have a neutral base colour than to have a flashy
but we need to be different
nah
yeah but the info
i think we should go with uh with the company colour because what specific info that i got from the project board
but the you
mm-hmm
so i think we should go with that
the young people want uh a trendy uh remote control
they want something trendy
so colourful uh is
huh
it's either black cover with yellow buttons or vice versa
and i would say take a yellow cover and black buttons
it is more trendy
that's definitely true
i think we should th then take it take yellow
to be different
yeah
take what you c yellow remote control
so let's see if if we can do the led onto it
you have the basic colours blue green red
uh oh
yeah we have so many colours already
so
you know what
oh it's okay
i'm not gonna do this
oh no that i think it's good thing to be different than
that's up to you guys
yeah
you doodle a doodle us a nice nice design for for the next meeting we'll be done
colourful you you
well
mm-hmm
i think we're all happy now
yep
i still don't have my scroll wheel though
yeah
yeah
stupid scroll wheel
uh that's nah that's true
oh where would you like to put it
yeah
'kay
i'm not sure uh i really i'm no i have no clue what we could use the scroll wheel for
uh you could use it for the channels and for the volume
no forget it
oh yeah
but it's has no real added value
no look it
you can
it takes space a lot of space
no that's not my point
and it could
it's not because it's functional but it's just to add to the design to have it flashy
ah may
it it has no function i agree
yeah but if it has no function then
i'm not sure if it if it has no function why even put it there
i agree
oh so many things have no function just design
and th that's just so much things that make it look flash
but uh uh scroll for a channel s selection or volume
mm-hmm
hmm
i think channel selection would be annoying because it just c you could scroll past the channel or
ma
mm-hmm
let's vote on it
oh okay
then we don't have to talk about it any longer
hmm
oh okay
what do you want
in or out
basically out
i don't see the
okay
you are out of course
you are okay clear
out
no r no scroll wheel
okay
um i don't see anything missing really
yeah we should too bad we don't have the finance
do you have all your answers
we could've
i have all my answers yes
okay
yeah
it's i'm not sure if we're if we're gonna get finance anyway because i thought we cou i thought it was gonna be an issue at the first time we started
i have to call this in a form
hmm
i thought it was gonna be a cost issue which material we were gonna take relative to the advanced chips or anything
hmm
hmm
there is i have one question
so you just do whatever you like and uh doesn't care what it costs
hmm
hmm
i only have one question with the material but i don't have information that
we've chosen rubber
i think we're rubber is not expensive
no but can we make yellow rubber
definitely
i think so
you can make rubber in any colour
yes you can colour rubber yeah
ah
in any colour
okay
so i mean you can't make yellow titanium but you can make yellow rubber
but we ha w we don't uh use our reco uh we uh removable cover
mm
okay
uh yeah we can make uh for example it's just something you can click on it like uh that's but it's not som not apparently that's not something we're working with in the basic design
no huh
maybe maybe later maybe we can uh
so
hmm
yeah it could be
it can be done for e
can i close this
uh we don't have any changes do we
so no
oh okay
there we go
okay here we are again
detailed design oh come on
well ah s forgot to insert the minutes but it's about the same thing we discussed before
uh
could open that anyway think
other design anyway we took as we took w we took rubber as as the material last time
we also that you're just busy with it
took the advanced chip to t uh implement the advanced features
well we discussed the design no sharp corners we rounded it off like you see on the other screen which is fine
um we agreed that the colour should be b uh yellow and black
yellow in the back because it's m trendy more trendy than black anyway
so then we ca yeah
we agreed that we would implement both the l. c. d. and speech recognition but i'll get to that in a moment
'cause some changes in the finances have
left us implications anyway
so so like i said we had no insight in finances no prices but we have 'em now
hmm
and it's bad
anyway
we are
oh
prototype presentation well first you guys built the prototype
so you could could present that
but um let's see what be handy to do
nee no you just go ahead and present the w we'll scrap it later because
i think it's more or less the same as we had
what
it's basically what we agreed upon but just a little bit more specified
hmm
oh that's
no much s
hasn't changed that much huh
no no no not at all
i didn't expect anyway
you just coloured it
uh s
final design
basically in what we discussed cover and buttons will be made of rubber yellow colour black components as you can see right over here
mm-hmm
we chose a different type of colour for the menu
i like the menu
a bit darker yellow so that it com really shows in this keypad
mm-hmm
if you put them all black it's not really that good a contrast
so
and i suppose the the the yellow is not printed on the on the rubber
it's it's part of the rubber i suppose
probab yeah
i think that's more i think that's more durable anyway than printed on to
that's the be
hmm
and it i guess it's more easier to just paint it on the rubber than to uh
yeah of course
mm yeah
that's uh the integration story again
okay
so we have it's a bit round shaped that's what we had uh
oh yeah
we chose the buttons to be uh teletext okay button favourite channel and the mute
mm-hmm
so that's basically what we chose there
okay
if you have anything to add please interrupt me
no uh this is just a description of what we see there
so
yeah
oh
yeah
speaks for itself
that's pretty much it
okay
now it's my time to ruin everything
well not ruin everything but no nah
oh sorry
finances that's what we have here what you drew
we have battery power we have advanced chips and the sam the sensor
the sample sensor and uh for speak recognition anyway
so which you see the which is de o one of the most expensive parts
so well we have sin one curve a design
rubber design
and we had a special colour
suppose yellow is a special colour
so just half a euro for you have pushbuttons and an l. c. d. display
you have the total of seventeen euros in production cost which is higher than the twelve and a half that we are permitted to use
hmm
so easy
hmm
what do we scrap
well think i had the best solution that i came up with is just to s take out the speech recognition
i d
yeah
i'd say that too
because the l. c. d. has more support on customer side
hmm
there are ninety one percent of uh the people or something like that
but ninety percent who favour an l. c. d. display and only sixty percent that favour speech recognition
i think it's also harder to
uh we don't really have a extra function with the speech sample which you can't do with a normal remote control which people already do
yeah
hmm
so
so i ju i took that out
so and so it's still stuck with thirteen so i had to take out the special colour i suppose
and yeah i didn't see anything else i could take out
yeah i could take out the push buttons but we need those
pushbut
huh
so generally what i came up with in order to be cou to to have production cost of twelve and a half euros
special colour yeah
spe scrap speech recognition and the separate covers can account for the if people want it we'll just then we'll do it in black
we'll just deliver it in black have the it has all the function that it's supposed to have
and if you want it if you want the custom design then you can buy the separate covers
you make it d orange or whatever you want
well i'd i tend to disagree with you on that because the trend issue was a big issue when we started designing this
it was a big issue but
so can't we just basically extend it to thirteen
i'll just go back
uh let's just let's see what okay let's just see what we no we we have to be under twelve and a half
yeah it
it it's not uh the project is a no go if we go over twelve and a half so
the p
okay but there's another problem
and the p
okay
but there's another problem
what
if we take another cover for instance black then we also need another button frame 'cause black and black doesn't work obviously
i think you that's what you were ass assigned to do really to to see how b th both those work together
huh
huh
yeah
so i think yeah it's i think it's y one of the it's a good way to um
to help people uh to make to keep the product trendy too
hmm
hmm
just keep you just make new covers for the for it like we agreed before
right
i agree
and everything that's left is is the basic function that uh that we want our product to have
because the expensive parts are in either the advanced chip
but we need that for the l. c. d. display
yeah
mm-hmm
we do
then again we have the l. c. d. display which is also expensive
b yeah but those go together
and yeah we could take out the curve
or say let's lose rubber take plastic
we could take out a curve indeed
could we could take out the curve
is that an option
yes
for you
although we are demolishing a little bit the style
but uh the and
i think the colour is more important than the really the curve because if you just end up with an entirely black remote control
but
yeah
yeah
i think it's it it does ruin it but the fact that i t took that decision or t
the people
yeah
took this example actually not really decision but the example is because we do offer the um the possibility of adding your own custom covers
so you can change any colour you want
so it's just you deliver a basic remote control with a possibility to change you into whatever you want
can we then not also uh change the material
we take plastic for the basic cover and
you can take plastic
but i d it's something that's stuck into my mind is that something that really came forward from the marketing research is that people like the the the the squishy feeling of the spongy feeling of the and it really makes it also makes it different from the existing remote controls
spongy yeah
we can put those to the to the other covers
yeah
and
because they're all plastic
that's true
so which in in turn rubber would increase durability because it doesn't break
but okay
but what do you then suggest we'd lose
because we have to lose two things and i guess
i al like i said i lost the speech recognition and i lost the special colour which would make this black a black and grey
but
yes
okay and that's enough
yeah that's that that that's enough because
so black and grey is okay
i guess those are the basic colours
but
so oh
hmm
which we can fabricate okay
the people want to pay for for it so why why uh do we have to keep us uh uh um on the twelve and a half
i think those are basic col
they want to
to ensure the profit
that that's th that's the order
we're just uh we're the project team and we got our our orders from the pro from the boss of our company which say we don't wanna spend more than twelve fifty for this
yeah
but we can take a risk
but that's not for our that's not our decision to take
no we basically
we have a budget of twelve fifty per product
okay yeah
hmm
we need to stick to that
so
stick that
i don't think it's really bad either
i mean if we we have the the backup of or the backup design thing
i hope the people will like it but
to have i think they would do
th i think they do like because yo we you we agree upon that the that the the the cover thing was a nice idea
because p you could have all sort of designs while at the same time just manufacturing one product
yeah
one basic product which you could turn into any any taste you want
so i think it's the best solution to make those cu custom covers for the design aspect and keep the functionality between of within the th the boundaries of the your f uh your budget
perhaps we should make m
yeah
huh
the first sheet
so
perhaps we should make clear to our customer that we had to do this to stay under the cost
and that's uh they know that this is an option and that we had to drop the option to stay under the cost that they know that
well i don't think yeah
perhaps they decide tha
is it worth is it is it does it mean anything to the customer
but they don't
like it like we don't care we don't care that you had to
of course
perhaps they uh no but perhaps they think uh okay the cover is such a nice idea
uh let's that that then they uh that allow us to make some more costs
we ca we uh we can at least tell them that
true but we did we didn't get that
so i think it's it should either be a pack
you don't know that
well
huh
maybe we sh that should be sold in in the s in stores with with a standard cover or something
no i'm not uh talking about that cost but the one that g has given us the order to design this
but
we could at least m uh make it like this like you said and then tell them okay
they could but uh
we had to drop this and that just that you know
it is an still an option but not for this price
it's an option but yeah it's true
so actually uh it's not that much of an increase but yeah
and if we
we cannot contact them
it's just the order that we got
exactly but
yeah
so that's what we gotta go with
so it's either one fi just just to get it f just to get it through final it's either turned into plastic
drop the squishy feel make it make it more breakable um or turn it yellow
yeah
hmm
so
it's uh something we have to decide on
i'd say lose the curve and the colour and
i say lose the curve
oh that's true we could lose the c yeah i forgot that sorry
uh the curve
so that's just this one just d this is the banana curve
so which curve is that ba that's basically that curve
hmm
yeah that's better
so this would this would be straight
so we could u still have the comfort
no uh no that would be a curve inside the thing i guess
no would ju then it would just be a straight remote
just like like that
hmm
which would yeah turn it into something far more ordinary
we could make it yellow then but
i second that
you second that you second that we lose the curve
no that it would turn out to be a pretty straight forward remote control
okay yeah
so that's not really that
yeah
yeah
so i think it would be a good idea to keep the curve to separate it from the rest of the remote control world so to speak
hmm
so we keep the curve
so the only only solution is either to use the l y lose the yellow or lose the rubber
i would
and i'm in favour of keeping the rubber because it has more more advantages than the colour yellow has
oh
i agree
yeah
i would say i would agree with you on the colour because that's an extra option
no
yep
an extra service we can deliver for a little bit of more money
mm-hmm
so we can always do that
yeah um i guess people are willing to pay for that
so i think we can take that option and just with uh with the idea in the back of our head that you can customise your remote control
yeah
hmm
so i think that would still make it a nice product
yes
okay we're final on that
so it's too bad we can't make the whole super thing
but anyways we're here
um yeah
which is basically what we discussed
this we discussed just now
that's just now just we could just discuss how the project went
i mean was kind of
and i want to do that
i sort of expected that everything would turn out this way but because you yeah everything cannot be for free
we didn't i think it was too bad we didn't have the financial info the last time
because that was i th it was really essential really to ma because we spent uh uh entire stage designing a product of which we had no idea what it would cost
yes we could have
huh
hmm
so we just put something i think it's really nor not in stroke with reality actually
yeah
so
me too i felt a bit blind throughout the project because in the beginning i had no list of available materials
yeah
yeah i think would have been
yeah
and then i d had not list of available c finances
but
materials would be ok at least the last meeting i would have expected had to have that
so
so i suppose
let's um see um
yeah let's see if it sells
i mean i suppose this sells because it's very very extended
um
but
well i hope it sells
let's
uh
hmm
i suppose it sells because it's good
oh
i mean it's got everything for the for the reasonable price because we didn't know what it's gonna cost anyway
hmm
hmm
okay let's eval evaluate uh the product of us our design
um i have some uh a method a requirements and scale of
i uh will pre present uh some statements and we will decided together wha what if it's true or false and uh then we see uh if the requirements of the user are fulfilled or not
okay
have been met okay
and i will
uh make a new blank sheet
yeah
so so the buttons the look and feel
i thought it was okay but the advanced uh settings um screen audio and channel
which are basically accessible through the menu button
they're stuck under menu
we are not
for the menu
hmm
i think those are totally met because we we really took them for the they have the feel they want they have the simplicity they want
oh the menu button is it
yeah
hi oh okay
then it's all uh
i think it's very uh very well met
either two or one maybe
s it's true
one
i think we took that everything they wanted into consideration
yeah
so it could either be a two or a one
so d
oh wait
one and a half
uh pen
which is not an option
the p
oh yeah it's red okay but
just create our own option
look and feel is everybo it's true
yeah
so
anyone
and the next one uh yeah when it's lost uh you can find it
it's perfect
even for deaf people yeah
it's
hmm
it's i don't think it's perfect but we did everything possible to to get it back
to make it that way yeah
because if it's stuck in you couch you can see the light
maybe you can hear it
but i mean we tried so i think it that's that deserves a one
yeah
and it's
and it's yeah
definitely
to
that's okay then
and the next one
how is that
uh w we had we don't have an uh
manual
manual yeah
but i think that's a part of it
i think the l. c. d. display could be a little bit more difficult then a normal remote control but then again it's for young people
but
i'd use an remote control
mm yeah
so
yeah an l. c. d. it tells a lot about uh
yeah i th
and it's pretty straight forward you have a navigation no keys to navigate through the l. c. d. menus
exactly
it's pretty straight forward uh-huh
no that's true
i think it won't be a big problem
yeah
so
so it's a one or a i don't know
one i d no actu
i think but we didn't even there was no issue on making a manual actually
for the advanced uh settings
we didn't really discuss it but
no okay that uh that's true
i don't think it takes no it really does doesn't take time to learn i think
we took it s it's so easy we have so little button everything speaks for itself really
no it it is pretty straight forward
oh so it
so i think that's yeah we didn't it's either two or one i guess
ah
um
takes no ti
maybe it's a two because d uh the l. c. d. is a little is a little new and there is there are some option hidden under the menu button
with the more important functions on
yeah
so i might make this a two instead of a one i guess
yeah
yeah
and the l. c. d. you have to see it
so just make that a two
um mm
oh it's a little bit
learning
okay
uh yeah it's uh a little bit same
but it tells you or not
mm-hmm
you can use the l. c. d. in a good way
i think so
i think it's perfect the w where it is what it can do if it useful
i think so
but wha w oh yeah
mm-hmm
what are we uh
displaying on the l. c. d. screen
just uh only the channels and or
the menus uh
what uh
things like brightness and uh those kind of things we've put in the menu because we have no buttons for those
well basically the menu options indeed
but
oh in the l. c. d. screen
no y i mean in the l. c. d. screen the small screen
yes
what does it display
and for a channel selection uh or that's not
well i thought it was i thought it was i thought that people wanted previews on their i'm not sure if that even possible
yeah i thought i thought too but yeah
but 'cause it's this requires a quite quite a bit of band width
i don't think it's possible really
but
the they didn't really define in what should be used for
but
maybe a t. v. guide or something in your l. c. d. uh
no
but i think in for example like t. v. guides i think that's that th that you can transmit through it and everything
mm
yeah
just for extra information on your programmes
yeah it must be clear then what what what for we use it
but also things like like like menus or p how about preferences of your uh with configuring your remote control for favourite your favourite channel for example
yeah
yeah
how do you configure that
so that could be done by l. c. d. display
i think it's good
no maybe it's not a one because it's we're not using it perfectly
we didn't give it i don't thing over discussing
now we gave it enough thought though
yeah
i think we d should just lower this
maybe maybe it's a three though
we could've used it more effectively probably
yeah indeed
so everybody's agree with an uh three on it it's
yes
yeah
yeah we are using it but it's not it's not poorly used but it's not efficiently used i think
two or three
w
yeah
so
we could have ev even lost the selection button and uh done everything via l. c. d. selection
yeah
it's now it's just extra to illustrate im uh extra features but okay
yeah i
a three
nah it's not really only an extra
you can seven
ah nothing that's
no menus
think about
a seven
uh that's uh
can you talk to remote control
or we could say it
well it can't talk anymore
yeah
so we scrap that
or we could say neutral we 'cause we scratched the
oh yeah just to be a prick but of course you can talk to your remote control it doesn't do anything
c
yeah yeah yeah yeah
but you c you can talk to it
not with the speech recognition
uh yeah all the trends and no colours uh anymore
so
well we did take everything into consideration of course
uh the shape i shape is i
yeah uh um only in the curves
i think we yeah i think that's okay
but the colours we don't have special colours on it
no we don't have the colour
yeah special co but we took into consideration the fact that it's customisable to the fashi
so i
yeah but we yeah we don't have it so d
yes but the end product so
hmm
we don't have it we do have it it's just sold as a package
in the end product
but
it does it's not part of the basic product
m
changing covers is also trend that we followed
it that that's what i call trendy
i mean the shape is trendy
the the sh the the functions are trendy
it's just the colours that are not supporting the basic model
now
because you ha it's just not affordable at the moment
but it's not a one
maybe we should go with a two then because it's not perfect because we can't do it initially but we
yeah
oh
mm-hmm
it's possible but you have to pay extra for the for the possibility of having it in a f a different colour
oh well
oops
oh it's a two right
yeah
mm-hmm
on the last one
uh that n that's all
overall score
overall score
overall
it's um
one two three
ten sixteen
sixteen
three uh two two point seven or something like that
two two point some two point something
hmm
i don't know why
ten sixteen
divided by
six
six
is two two third
two and two thirds
um
so we can say it's it's the product is it's okay
it's okay but that's yo m mostly it's it's influenced by the fact that we didn't have enough resources to implement speech recognition
y not
mm-hmm
there's
mm-hmm
'cause yeah that gives you a seven which ruins your your average
yeah
without that it would be like under it wouldn't yeah it would be under two
so i think we have even with this it's reasonable
woah
yeah if we make it into a four as in neutral because we didn't implement it
so we can't say that we that it's really not well implemented
yeah
we come out on a average of two one eighth
well i think it's two is okay
so which is pretty w good
mm-hmm
yeah two is pretty good
it's at least on the positive side
so we could definitely have done better if we've had more resources but
hmm of course
definitely
yeah
yeah
i think it's probably i i do admit that we d did miss a little or didn't sp didn't talk talk enough about the possibility of the l. c. d. display
mm-hmm
yeah
we could have used it more efficiently we just didn't think of it that way
yeah
yeah
yeah with
true
so like i said changing channels everything hidden in your l. c. d. display so you just need the navigation buttons to do everything
the scale
but i think for this price this is it's really a reasonable product
i think we div i think we did very well uh ev even if you look at this score we did quite well
it's a good product
yeah
with an l. c. d. screen
oh
it just looking for improvements what what you could have improved
oh
yeah
so
but if pep people really want speech recognition then they must be prepared to pu to pay more because it's cannot be done for this
they sh they should get kids and just stick 'em in t. v. and say change the channel
yeah you can make 'em another one
hmm yeah
ah but for this price uh you cannot ask that
i don' think so
you cannot th think of that
uh it's just not it it's not affordable
no it's not
or your sh you should lose the l. c. d. screen probably but i think that's i think the l. c. d. screen is more worth than speech recognition
mm-hmm
oh it's also more attractive
definitely
okay that was that
yeah
yeah
so that's the final product without the speakers i guess
so did you
let's see what was left in the the another one
hmm
yeah we evaluate the product
general project what's i in for example i thou i thought we were pretty creative in what we created
we took the whole new approach of making exchangeable cover for example which i thought was pretty creative because it was never never ever listed somewhere
hmm
favourite channel
well
anyways
yeah leadership is up to you
i mean perhaps i screwed up because i d put a put a speech recognition into it
but that's not for me to decide
yeah i know
i think we did pretty well as team work though
yeah
because yeah was very hard to work with one another if you cannot communicate in the meantime
yes
hmm
because when i got the when i got the input for the financial results initially of course i wanted to contact you
hmm
yeah you're working separate
yeah
say look this is you're doing the wrong thing you're s you're wasting your time now because we're implementing stuff that we cannot afford
yeah
huh
yeah
yeah yeah yeah
hmm
so it would be better if y if there was more communication between uh because that's that's what would w you what you would normally do
hmm
yeah yeah yeah
direct uh communication with yeah
and we could share information which we received
either call or email someone
so that was too bad con was impossible here anyways
hmm
that's the same thing that i had in the beginning
everybody was using materials that s i didn't have
so
it didn't have or didn't knew what they costs or whatever
yeah
oh
there was just too little information about what things actually cost and if you could use them
yeah
hmm
so that was a little unclear i suppose
i think a smartboard smartboard is pretty cool
i think uh s especially for design issues it's very easy just to give your give your thoughts a little it's easier to share them
my handwriting is little bit yeah
yeah
hmm
although for actual design i'd say the response time should be a little bit higher because
it's a little less it the response time is le it's very bad
hmm
it's good to visualise everything but i think the response time should could be a lot better
the digital pen was definitely better to draw my ideas and to
but th that's
definitely
mm-hmm
yeah it's true
yeah okay
further elaborate on that
so
but there's uh also one problem with this i noticed
uh you have to finish a page before going to a n
no you don't have to
no
no you don't
i jin i didn't check the finish button
you can
oh
i just you just ditch it and you can copy it or whatever
done and then it's okay
okay i saw that uh
uh only if you uh check the notes or press done
then it um then you can then it exports to word automatically
hmm
but it's not necessary to check either one of those two
you can just preview your p you can just preview your page in the in the programme
yeah but i made
oh okay
okay but i made three pages and they were not finished
okay yeah
and when the third one was finished i wanted to download it and then it was not possible anymore
because you have to close all the pinnits uh the pages before going further
okay before starting a ne a new page
okay
okay that could be b
exactly
so we cannot work on more than one page at same time
oh
that's not possible
hmm
you have to finish it completely then download it it's then start a new one
okay
oh can you
okay
yeah okay
that's not very uh handy but if you know that then it's not a problem
that's
yeah it's understandable okay
any new ideas
yeah more communication between between uh that's the thing i noticed that communication is very um very important
important to mm
because if you get new information it's essential f for the other team mates to know that as soon as possible
because you would avoid making doing extra work because you were doing extra work now uh m working on the on the speech recognition
yeah
you have limitation both on the technical on the d on the design side
so i think that could have been better
but that's i think it's more of a a setting here that you cannot communicate than uh than somewhere else
hmm
so
yeah well it could also possibly be well is it a more real time information base so we can all see which information is available to one another
yeah i think so
and l less p less spam probably
i'm not sure i i'm not sure you got spammed as well
mm-hmm
but i get spammed like every t every two minutes there was a there was another email about master classes or something
ah
well
so which were totally useless actually
hmm
i thought i should probably look into them but they were all useless
so i just
well i personally did not have that but
mm
oh okay
that's probably your l description
but i also didn't not really
but still you had that as well
huh
is that we finished up the design and then we checked the website and then there was just extra information
yeah
yeah after
after five minutes uh
yeah
there was a little delay in the bit of a c
yeah
i didn't have any uh more information it's just always the same here
crucial delay
mm
so that's that's kind of a
email uh
it would change but not for me
so i'd i had no extra information to go on that one than what you give me actually
hmm
hmm
i couldn't do any research myself or i see that's yeah w i could have done a little extra work probably then
hmm
it's
but i was busy enough anyway
so
hmm
yeah
any new ideas found
or is that a 'cause uh yeah it's well probably is
no
how much time do we have for this anyway
i have no clue
that's like it
should i if the project is evaluated and it was it was in b within budget we should celebrate
so
okay bring out the beer
yeah
champagne
uh okay think that's about it
i want one for my own
uh
i'm not sure what we should still do though uh t let's see what all your tasks were finished right
yeah
what you ha from your assistant
i have no more email
so let's
my coach is uh being very silent now
yeah my personal coach i
okay i should i think i sh i still have the the total report to finish up
i think we took very little time now because
yeah we're in agreement everything the design is okay
the one thing we missed though
we don't have a product name
what
no we haven't think above about that
how about you cook a how about you cook up a product name
product name
yeah name
huh
it's better than thi i think than a serial number
sony uh t. r. something uh f means nothing to me
or fruit name
just oh think of a catchy name
uh
i'll be working on this until the beep until it beeps
so
like fruit names
fruit name or something like that
the banana remote or something
what
fruit
you don't want it to resemble a banana
i don't know
yeah it's the form of it
the bana 'cause it's not yellow anymore
it's not yellow anyway
yeah oh yeah
it's not yellow anymore
it is curved but
uh yeah
well uh i was going for the r. c. deluxe but it's not really a catchy name or anything it's more
uh
no it's
uh at least it's not something with numbers
hmm
numbers are so meaningless to the people
yeah
i mean
something with our company name can we do anything with that
that's true
reaction real reaction
maybe there's something on the website which will help us out
real reaction
the reaction deluxe
real reaction future r. c.
step into the future of of remote controlling your t. v.
is that a name or a c campaign
no that's a that's a catchy slogan
yeah
or the
control your remote control
the real reactor
real react
i go for future r. c. probably
something like
it's short f
the real reactor i don't find that uh that bad at all
real reactor
yeah
you should write it down as a an option
because our name is real reaction
uh that that's
that makes me think of different products than a remote control really
i'm not sure
real reaction in a real
zapping
the
so that's one option
real reactor
didn't notice
i'm looking for things in the name
mm
so that the first three letters are s the same
should i write the banana down or
r. e. a. r. e. a.
yeah sure
i take f yeah take a banana
sure
the banana
hmm
remote
banana recei r. c.
the triple r.
real reaction remotes control
remote
well i
triple r.
r. three c.
uh do you mean it like
r. three c.
yeah
you mean it like this
yeah that
real reaction remote control
r. three c.
oh yeah
no not like that
it should be it should be longer because it's not a product name that you f print on a box
i think
triple r.
doesn't sound
just write out triple like a word triple r. c. triple stripe oh
yeah triple r.
yeah
triple dash r. dash s s c.
triple r. c.
ah
the triple r. c. yeah
yeah
r. s r. three c.
r. dash c.
dash c.
i think i like it like this more
dash
triple r. or triple r. c.
like a c. right now or a dash in a c.
triple r. dash
how about do both
sure if it looks stupid
uh i think that the the r. c. together takes away the the the image of it's a triple
hmm
uh the first the first one looks like it's a triple remote control but it's only a single remote control
mm
that
and it's especially on the triple r. that's important
yeah this yeah
i would huh
the real reaction remote
i would lose the c. and just name it triple r.
is it triple r. c. s
no
it sounds like uh thinking about two different things and combining it
triple remote
i would just say triple r. s triple r.
yeah
yeah triple r. yeah you can
well that's another option
that's also short catchy
it's okay
yeah triple r.
okay so which ones are we going to scratch
the banana
definitely
banana
banana remote
banana
i say this one as well
yeah the deluxe
i think we're all in agreement about the triple r.
i think triple r. is cool
yes
the r triple r.
triple r.
triple r. it is
and it looks cool when you print it in font looks pretty cool
yeah
did you do now
just like this just and you just print triple r. it looks doesn't look bad it's short it's okay
yeah
yeah
so have to write my report now i guess
um
um
yeah so we have everything
we have the product we have the costs we have the possibility of everything
yep
it can't work
that will not
okay
i think it's adjourned
retire to my lair and finish the report
that was a short meeting
mm-hmm
but efficient though
the boss is always the last one to go home
so
probably
see
okay goodbye
okay
see you in a minute
damn
i will write that one
in a word uh document
okay
could you guys draw me a picture of the final design to put on the cover of the report
yeah sure
can't we take this one
oh sh
otherwise we have to do it all over again
um
i don't really know whether we can save it as a picture or no
is it okay if i try
is that okay with you
sure
yeah okay i will ask you when uh i need the information
i'll put it back in a minute
so it's oh
okay it has been saving something but where to i don't know
uh
oh
merge
oh can i say exp yes i can
sucks
export as j. peg
okay can i not put this
wherever i wants
my document is the wrong one huh
yeah but
i cannot
network places
i don't know
smart no
ma it's maybe it's not on the network of uh the rest
i don't think so
that one is
document and settings
i wouldn't pick that one no
that's a pity
that means that we have to gonna draw it again
